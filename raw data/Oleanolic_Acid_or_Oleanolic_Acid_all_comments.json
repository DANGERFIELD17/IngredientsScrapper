    "body": "\nHey all! 👋🏻I want to review hair growth serum from minimalist-\n\nSo i have straight fine hair(little below shoulder length)(30s/F), oily scalp. \n\nI have been suffering from hair loss for past two years. I haven't checked with my derm. I have lost some hair (in patches) because of my tight hairstyle. Then came humidity season and my hair were everywhere. Before taking an appointment I decided to try hair serum. I started on 29th june. \n\n\n29/6: Started with serum. First application was hassle free. No burning or warming of the scalp. I used 4 drops front of scalp(problem area) and 4 drops back of my head, everyday, in the AM(as i take shower in the PM). Rubbed into my fingers and then Massaged only on my scalp and not on length. It was non greasy.\n\n\n01/07: In just two days I started to feel my hair fall is less, like 3-4 strands in my comb. I thought its a placebo effect.\n\n\nI continued it for two weeks straight, every day and my hair fall reduced by 20%. I stopped the application on 14/7 for two weeks as i was traveling and wanted to see if hairfall return and to my luck it Did. But it wasn't alot. I think some people miss understand that after stopping hairfall doubles but it's just the same amount you used to get(at least for me)\nI restarted again and still using it and now i can say I definitely see hair looks bit thicker, have seen baby hair growth especially at the hairline and hair fall has reduced to 80%. \n\nI will keep using it as it dint have any side effects except one stubborn cc which always occurs on my forehead if apply regularly. Thus i now use it 4-5 times a week(depends on which day i ll shampoo and workout)\n\nIts non greasy if applied less but if you directly use the dropper on scalp you might end up using alot and it will give oily look. My scalp normally gets oily on 3rd day but with everyday application of serum hair looks oily on 2nd day. \n\n\nPROS: 1. It works.\n2. New hair growth. \n3. Hair seem thicker.\n4. Less hairfall.\n\n\nCONS: 1.Everyday application is a task for long hair and oily scalp as you need to shampoo.\n2. Give cc on forehead with regular use.\n3. Don't think its a permanent cure.\n4. Expensive.\n\nInci:\nButylene Glycol, Aqua, Dextran, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3, Trifolium Pratense (Clover) Flower Extract, Propanediol, Arginine, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Gluconolactone, Calcium Gluconate, Glycerin, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Apigenin, Oleanolic Acid, Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Sprout Extract, Isomalt, Sodium Metabisulfite, Larix Europaea Wood Extract, Glycine, Zinc Chloride, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Saccharide Isomerate, Sanguisorba Officinalis Root Extract, Serenoa Serrulata (Saw Palmetto) Fruit Extract, Capryloyl Glycine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Lactic Acid\n\n\nTL:DR- True to its claims, will repurchase it!\n------------------------------",

    "body": "Before I go any further, I should point out that this in no way constitutes medical advice, or an alternative to medically administered treatments. I just read a lot and have saved info as I find it and this shouldn't be taken as a suggestion to go out and buy any particular thing.\n\nThe purpose of this is two-fold, firstly that it may trigger some new thinking in a medically qualified person to take further, and secondly it is intended to discuss theoretically how to help reduce the risk of serious outcomes in the event of infections and possibly shift the odds in favour of a non lethal resolution, and used as a prophylactic would have low risk of side-effects, be generally safe and may also be generally beneficial to the preexisting conditions identified as risk factors for mortality (so not a complete waste of time even if it doesn't work). It's important to note that current front-line antivirals can often have significant toxicity including cause organ failure, one of the nasty outcomes of COVID-19. So as a prophylactic aid treatments must be safer than the disease by a very large margin.\n\nBecause of the low likelihood these treatments might work significantly, they should at least be useful in the sense of being comparatively safe, and beneficial to health in general.\n\nBecause of the low death rate and the demographics of deaths, COVID-19 appears to be most dangerous when combined with prior poor health at the time of infection, and so that is where the greatest potential probably lies in finding a treatment.\n\nTreatments may be divided into three avenues.\n\n1 - those that are antiviral, by blocking virus entry or replication. These in turn may work best taken during or prior to infection, or both.\n\n2 - those that reduce the disease and injury associated with the infection, of excess and poorly targeted immune response and inflammation. In mice at least, inhibiting NF-kB increases survival against SARS coronavirus [https://jvi.asm.org/content/88/2/913](https://jvi.asm.org/content/88/2/913)\n\n3 - those that are aimed at enhancing immune health and preventing exhaustion and loss of key antiviral defences and this presumably would lower both viral load and the risk of other infections and sepsis, which we assume along with 2, are the primary causes of injury and death. In addition, treatments that reduce the bacterial and viral load prior to infection would reduce the risk of sepsis and infection complications, and make it potentially easier to mount an efficient, targeted immune response to the infection, which may mean it never develops. Certain cells are depleted in COVID-19 infection, such as lymphocytes. Substances such as selenium may increase these cell counts during infection in other viral diseases, and improve antibody production in diabetics, another COVID-19 risk group. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5381341/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5381341/), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3762230/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3762230/)\n\nWe might assume that impaired antibody responses are a factor here, especially as some people resolve the infection almost without symptoms, and for whom the infection is simply a live vaccine, and also in general many pathogens already present in the human body produce 'super-antigens', substances that cause antibody production, but cause inaccurate antibodies to be made, which causes collateral damage. As a result of prolonged collateral damage, the immune system normally goes into 'anergy' and tolerance, which are risk factors in the death rate due to measles, especially in malnourished people. A person already suffering from multiple infections of viral, fungal and bacterial super-antigen producers would be in a bad place to mount efficient humoral responses. So, because of immune stresses like this, taking compounds that are broad spectrum antimicrobials may be of help either prior to or during an infection.\n\n4 - Those that may generally improve health and protect against the preexisting conditions that seem to be large risk factors in the death rate of COVID-19, such as potentially reducing liver injury via oxidative stress, metabolic impairments in type 2 diabetes etc. These factors also can increase translation and presumably quantity of the ACE2 protein that the virus uses to gain entry, and this is theoretically a risk factor. Inflammation can increase this, and it therefore a good time to consider giving up bad habits like smoking and excessive drinking, and increase the intake of apples, nuts and berries and lower your blood glucose.\n\nViruses generally target mitochondria as part of their strategy to establish themselves in cells, because mitochondria are critical parts of the intracellular defence against viruses, conducting virtually every antiviral pathway in the cell, and just about every means of degrading intracellular material and parasites are directly controlled by mitochondria. Human coronaviruses are known to target mitochondria. In addition, this targeting may play an important role in the loss of certain immune cells in this infection, which we presume means higher viral load and worse outcome.\n\nIt is noteworthy that conditions associated with abnormal Redox status, oxidative stress, energy impairment, like diabetes, are unsurprisingly risk factors for death and injury from this virus.\n\nSome background on the early clinical aspects of the infection - [https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ewxsfj/coronavirus\\_notes\\_immunal\\_deficiency\\_theoretical/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ewxsfj/coronavirus_notes_immunal_deficiency_theoretical/)\n\nThe general ideas I have are not novel, and are even being trialed -\n\n[https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/wuhan-virus-new-antivirus-spray-used-in-shanghai-emergency-wards](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/wuhan-virus-new-antivirus-spray-used-in-shanghai-emergency-wards)\n\nThe new spray contains two active ingredients, Prof Xu said. One restrains the duplication of the virus and the other controls the process of the virus causing illness in people. **The virus made people sick by causing inflammation**, he explained. The active ingredients can suppress the inflammation and repair the respiratory tract mucosa.\n\nHere is an interesting paper I found recently which explores natural compounds as treatments for COVID-19 [https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202001.0358/v1](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202001.0358/v1)\n\nSo, with this in mind, here is what I have found of potential interest; Many have shown broad antiviral properties. They show antiviral effects in a variety of species and across a spectrum of viruses, and a few also against coronaviruses. However an agent that works against one coronavirus does not necessarily affect another variety of coronavirus. In general I assume that a compound that has a broad antiviral effect against dissimilar viruses, but including similar viruses to coronaviruses, are of more interest, and especially if they showed effect against at least one coronovirus.\n\nSelenium\n\nSelenium has broad antiviral properties, and other health benefits (when not taken excessively), see this earlier post [https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/f2hyun/selenium\\_infectious\\_viral\\_disease\\_and\\_pneumonia/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/f2hyun/selenium_infectious_viral_disease_and_pneumonia/)\n\nIn addition, organic selenium compounds in fish like sardines are ACE inhibitors, although this may not include ACE2, which is the key one. It is not known if ACE inhibitors are effective against COVID-19, but it has been proposed ([https://f1000research.com/articles/9-72](https://f1000research.com/articles/9-72)). The type of inhibition we might want is probably in the translation aspect which reduces the quantity of ACE on cell membranes, which is how COVID gets in. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12562-019-01321-3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12562-019-01321-3) . On the other hand, ACE2, in contrast to ACE, can be anti-inflammatory and so inhibiting it may not be a good idea.\n\nPolyphenols, Terpenoids, Lignans, Lectins\n\nBetulinic Acid (mainly from birch bark) and lignin [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17663539](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17663539)\n\n*The selective index values (SI = CC50/EC50) of the most potent compounds 1, 5, 6, 8, 14, and 16 were 58, >510, 111, 193, 180, and >667, respectively. Betulinic acid (13) and savinin (16) were competitive inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CL protease with Ki values = 8.2 +/- 0.7 and 9.1 +/- 2.4 microM, respectively.

For example, complete inhibition occurred when pre-treatment of virus was done in combination with post-infection treatment (Figure 4).

Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed four large-scale datasets of normal lung tissue to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression. No significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression were found between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (>60 vs <60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in smoker samples compared to non-smoker samples. This indicates the smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and thus smoking history should be considered in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.",

If COVID19 coronavirus is inhibited by glutathione it will make an even strong case for N Acetyl Cysteine, Lipoic Acid, and Carnosine;\n\nGlutathione has been reported to block replication of HIV, HSV-1, and influenza virus, whereas cells treated with BSO exhibit increased replication of Sendai virus. Pre-treatment of HeLa cell monolayers with BSO inhibited replication of CVB3, CVB4, and HRV14 with viral titers reduced by approximately 6, 5, and 3 log10, respectively. The addition of glutathione ethyl ester, but not dithiothreitol or 2-mercaptoethanol, to the culture medium reversed the inhibitory effect of BSO. Viral RNA and protein synthesis were not inhibited by BSO treatment. Fractionation of lysates from CVB3-infected BSO-treated cells on cesium chloride and sucrose gradients revealed that empty capsids but not mature virions were being produced. The levels of the 5S and 14S assembly intermediates, however, were not affected by BSO treatment.

We demonstrate that cells of different origins display differential permissivity for influenza A virus replication, depending on their intracellular redox power as reflected by Bcl-2 expression and glutathione (GSH) content. Bcl-2 expressing cells were found to have higher intracellular levels of GSH and to produce lower amounts of virus than Bcl-2 negative cells. Two different steps in the virus life-cycle were involved in Bcl-2/GSH mediated viral inhibition: 1) expression of late viral proteins (in particular hemagglutinin and matrix); and 2) nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs). Buthionine-sulfoximine-induced inhibition of GSH synthesis in Bcl-2 expressing cells caused an increase in the expression of late viral proteins but did not restore vRNP export to the cytoplasm. Collectively, our findings show that both Bcl-2 expression and GSH content contribute to the host cell's ability to down-regulate influenza virus replication, although their effects are exerted at different stages of the viral life-cycle. In certain cell populations, this form of down-regulation might conceivably favor the establishment of persistent viral infection.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12594179](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12594179)\n\nAn interaction between glutathione and the capsid is required for the morphogenesis of C-cluster enteroviruses.\n\n\".... the aim of our study was to determine the role of GSH in the growth of two C-cluster enteroviruses, poliovirus type 1 (PV1) and coxsackievirus A20 (CAV20).

Seaweed Lotion (150 ML) \n\n- Ingredients: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Butylene Glycol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Water, Sargassum Fulvellum Extract, Gelidium Cartilagineum Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycerin, Panthenol, Polyglutamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Allantoin, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n- Review: I also have mixed thoughts about this lotion. This product is unscented and the smell of the moisturizer doesn’t bother me. This is a very basic moisturizer. Sometimes this would make my face feel itchy but my face was dehydrated at the time I was using this. I wouldn’t repurchase it and am now using it as a hand lotion (which works). 3/5\n\n6.) Seaweed Skin Toner (150 ML)\n\n- Ingredients: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Water, Sargassum Fulvellum Extract, Gelidium Cartilagineum Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Polyglutamic Acid, Panthenol, Allantoin, Betaine, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n- Review: This is a great toner but after I started using the Matsuyama Hadauru Moisturizing Infusion Balancing Lotion, I used this one less. I haven’t repurchased it. I also used it before applying lotion on my body (which feels nice and cooling). This is a lightweight toner that can easily be layered. This product is also unscented. 4/5",

    "body": "Before I go any further, I should point out that this in no way constitutes medical advice, or an alternative to medically administered treatments. I just read a lot and have saved info as I find it and this shouldn't be taken as a suggestion to go out and buy any particular thing.\n\nThe purpose of this is two-fold, firstly that it may trigger some new thinking in a medically qualified person to take further, and secondly it is intended to discuss theoretically how to help reduce the risk of serious outcomes in the event of infections and possibly shift the odds in favour of a non lethal resolution, and used as a prophylactic would have low risk of side-effects, be generally safe and may also be generally beneficial to the preexisting conditions identified as risk factors for mortality (so not a complete waste of time even if it doesn't work). It's important to note that current front-line antivirals can often have significant toxicity including cause organ failure, one of the nasty outcomes of COVID-19. So as a prophylactic aid treatments must be safer than the disease by a very large margin.\n\nBecause of the low likelihood these treatments might work significantly, they should at least be useful in the sense of being comparatively safe, and beneficial to health in general.\n\nBecause of the low death rate and the demographics of deaths, COVID-19 appears to be most dangerous when combined with prior poor health at the time of infection, and so that is where the greatest potential probably lies in finding a treatment.\n\nTreatments may be divided into three avenues.\n\n1 - those that are antiviral, by blocking virus entry or replication. These in turn may work best taken during or prior to infection, or both.\n\n2 - those that reduce the disease and injury associated with the infection, of excess and poorly targeted immune response and inflammation. In mice at least, inhibiting NF-kB increases survival against SARS coronavirus [https://jvi.asm.org/content/88/2/913](https://jvi.asm.org/content/88/2/913)\n\n3 - those that are aimed at enhancing immune health and preventing exhaustion and loss of key antiviral defences and this presumably would lower both viral load and the risk of other infections and sepsis, which we assume along with 2, are the primary causes of injury and death. In addition, treatments that reduce the bacterial and viral load prior to infection would reduce the risk of sepsis and infection complications, and make it potentially easier to mount an efficient, targeted immune response to the infection, which may mean it never develops. Certain cells are depleted in COVID-19 infection, such as lymphocytes. Substances such as selenium may increase these cell counts during infection in other viral diseases, and improve antibody production in diabetics, another COVID-19 risk group. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5381341/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5381341/), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3762230/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3762230/)\n\nWe might assume that impaired antibody responses are a factor here, especially as some people resolve the infection almost without symptoms, and for whom the infection is simply a live vaccine, and also in general many pathogens already present in the human body produce 'super-antigens', substances that cause antibody production, but cause inaccurate antibodies to be made, which causes collateral damage. As a result of prolonged collateral damage, the immune system normally goes into 'anergy' and tolerance, which are risk factors in the death rate due to measles, especially in malnourished people. A person already suffering from multiple infections of viral, fungal and bacterial super-antigen producers would be in a bad place to mount efficient humoral responses. So, because of immune stresses like this, taking compounds that are broad spectrum antimicrobials may be of help either prior to or during an infection.\n\n4 - Those that may generally improve health and protect against the preexisting conditions that seem to be large risk factors in the death rate of COVID-19, such as potentially reducing liver injury via oxidative stress, metabolic impairments in type 2 diabetes etc. These factors also can increase translation and presumably quantity of the ACE2 protein that the virus uses to gain entry, and this is theoretically a risk factor. Inflammation can increase this, and it therefore a good time to consider giving up bad habits like smoking and excessive drinking, and increase the intake of apples, nuts and berries and lower your blood glucose.\n\nViruses generally target mitochondria as part of their strategy to establish themselves in cells, because mitochondria are critical parts of the intracellular defence against viruses, conducting virtually every antiviral pathway in the cell, and just about every means of degrading intracellular material and parasites are directly controlled by mitochondria. Human coronaviruses are known to target mitochondria. In addition, this targeting may play an important role in the loss of certain immune cells in this infection, which we presume means higher viral load and worse outcome.\n\nIt is noteworthy that conditions associated with abnormal Redox status, oxidative stress, energy impairment, like diabetes, are unsurprisingly risk factors for death and injury from this virus.\n\nSome background on the early clinical aspects of the infection - [https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ewxsfj/coronavirus\\_notes\\_immunal\\_deficiency\\_theoretical/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ewxsfj/coronavirus_notes_immunal_deficiency_theoretical/)\n\nThe general ideas I have are not novel, and are even being trialed -\n\n[https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/wuhan-virus-new-antivirus-spray-used-in-shanghai-emergency-wards](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/wuhan-virus-new-antivirus-spray-used-in-shanghai-emergency-wards)\n\nThe new spray contains two active ingredients, Prof Xu said. One restrains the duplication of the virus and the other controls the process of the virus causing illness in people. **The virus made people sick by causing inflammation**, he explained. The active ingredients can suppress the inflammation and repair the respiratory tract mucosa.\n\nHere is an interesting paper I found recently which explores natural compounds as treatments for COVID-19 [https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202001.0358/v1](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202001.0358/v1)\n\nSo, with this in mind, here is what I have found of potential interest; Many have shown broad antiviral properties. They show antiviral effects in a variety of species and across a spectrum of viruses, and a few also against coronaviruses. However an agent that works against one coronavirus does not necessarily affect another variety of coronavirus. In general I assume that a compound that has a broad antiviral effect against dissimilar viruses, but including similar viruses to coronaviruses, are of more interest, and especially if they showed effect against at least one coronovirus.\n\nSelenium\n\nSelenium has broad antiviral properties, and other health benefits (when not taken excessively), see this earlier post [https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/f2hyun/selenium\\_infectious\\_viral\\_disease\\_and\\_pneumonia/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/f2hyun/selenium_infectious_viral_disease_and_pneumonia/)\n\nIn addition, organic selenium compounds in fish like sardines are ACE inhibitors, although this may not include ACE2, which is the key one. It is not known if ACE inhibitors are effective against COVID-19, but it has been proposed ([https://f1000research.com/articles/9-72](https://f1000research.com/articles/9-72)). The type of inhibition we might want is probably in the translation aspect which reduces the quantity of ACE2 on cell membranes, which is how COVID gets in. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12562-019-01321-3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12562-019-01321-3) . On the other hand, ACE2, in contrast to ACE, can be anti-inflammatory and so inhibiting it may not be a good idea.\n\nPolyphenols, Terpenoids, Lignans, Lectins\n\nBetulinic Acid (mainly from birch bark) and lignin [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17663539](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17663539)\n\n*The selective index values (SI = CC50/EC50) of the most potent compounds 1, 5, 6, 8, 14, and 16 were 58, >510, 111, 193, 180, and >667, respectively. Betulinic acid (13) and savinin (16) were competitive inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CL protease with Ki values = 8.2 +/- 0.7 and 9.1 +/- 2.4 microM, respectively.

For example, complete inhibition occurred when pre-treatment of virus was done in combination with post-infection treatment (Figure 4).

It is a small tree belonging to the myrtle family (Myrtaceae). Native to tropical areas from southern Mexico to northern South America, guava trees have been grown by many other countries having tropical and subtropical climates.\n\nIt has anti-oxidant, antiviral, antibacterial, antiinflammatory, Anti-diarrhoeal, Anti-hypotensive, Analgesic & Anti-hypertensive, Antifungal, Antipyretic properties.\n\n\nIt has different names in different languages such as in English(Guava), Marathi(Jamba, Jambh, Peru), Hindi(Amrood), Gujarati(Jamrud, Jamrukh, Peru), Kannada(Gova, Jamaphala, Perala, Sibi, Sebehabbu), Bengali(Goaachhi, peyara),  Malayalam(Pera, Koyya), Tamil(Koyya, Segappugoyya, Sengoyya, Vellaikoyya, Uyyakkondan), Telugu(Jama), Oriya(Bodojamo, Jamo, Julabojamo, Pijuli), Sanskrit( amrutaphalam, maduphalam, peruka, bahubeej).\n\n\nGuava fruit discription \n\nGuava  fruit  generally  have  a  pronounced  and  typical  fragrance.  Guava  pulp  may  be  sweet  or  sour,    tasting    something    between    pear    and    strawberry,  off-white  (\"white\"  guavas)  to  deep  pink (\"red\" guavas), with the seeds in the central pulp of variable number and hardness, depending on   species.   The   fruits are   fleshy,   sweet   and   emanate  a  slight  but  pleasant  odor. \n\n\n￼\n\n\n\n\nVitamin and mineral content \n\nVitamin : B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B9, C, K, A\n\nMineral : Calcium, Iron, Magnesium, Manganese, Phosphorus, Potassium, Podium, Zinc, copper\n\n• It has more vitamin C than the orange. \n\n• Guava contains a large number of antioxidants and phytochemicals including essential oils, polysaccharides, minerals, vitamins, enzymes, and triterpenoid acid alkaloids, steroids, glycosides, tannins, flavonoids and saponins. \n\n                 - Guava contains a higher content of vitamin C and vitamin A. \n\n                 - Guava is also a very good source of the pectin which is an important dietary fiber.\n\n                 - It has high content of flavonoids, fructose sugar and carotenoids.\n\n                 - There are 41 hydrocarbons 25 esters, 13 alcohols and 9 aromatic compounds in guava\n\n• The strong pleasant smell of fruit is credited to the carbonyl compounds.\n\n• Guava fruit contains terpenes, caryophyllene oxide and p-selinene in large quantity which produce relaxation effects.\n\n                 - The skin of fruit contains ascorbic acid in very high amount; however, it may be destroyed by heat.\n\n                 - Ascorbic acid and citric acid are the major ingredients of guava that play important role in anti-mutagenic activity.\n\n                 - The fruit contains saponin, oleanolic acid, lyxopyranoside, arabopyranoside, guaijavarin, quercetin and flavonoids.\n\n• Essential oil is present in leaves which contain α-pinene, limonene, β-pinene, isopropyl alcohol, menthol, terpenyl acetate, caryophyllene, longicyclene and β-bisabolene. Leaves of guava have a lot of volatile compounds.\n\n                 - Oleanolic acid is also found in the guava leaves. Leaves have high content of limonene about 42.1% and caryophyllene about 21.3%. \n\n• The bark includes 12–30% of tannin and polyphenols, crystals of calcium oxalate. \n\n                - Tannin is also present in roots. Leukocyanidins, gallic acid and sterols are also present in roots. Carbohydrates with salts are present in abundance. Tannic acid is also its part.\n\n\n\nBenefits, uses and application\n\n1) It is used as food and in the preparation of food products. It is also used in house construction and toys making.\n\n\n2) Guava leaves has great medicinal properties and use in the treatment of various illness.\n\n\n3) Drinking guava leaves juice, is one of the best way to Lowering Cholesterol, Lowering Blood-Sugar Levels and Preventing Type2 Diabetes.\n\n                   - When guava is eaten, the dietary fiber present in it enters the body, binds to bile acid and excretes it out of the body. Now, bile acid is required by the body for the digestion of fat. To produce this bile acid, the body uses cholesterol, which is present in the body. Because cholesterol is being used for the synthesis of bile acid, its concentration in the blood decreases and hence, the overall blood cholesterol level is reduced.\n\n\n4) Take unripe guava. Cut it and apply sendha namak and roast. Eat this roasted guava to treat cough. OR. Take few leaves of guava. Clean them properly and crush them in mortar and pestle and made paste. Add in glass of water and boil till water reduces to 1/4 of initial amount, filter and drink it is lukewarm.\n\n\n5) Guava leaves imparts anti-stress effects. Drink herbal tea of guava leaves(Add some guava leaves in cup of water reduce half and then drink).\n\n\n6) Chewing leaf is a common remedy for upset stomach, gum bleeding, bad breath, mouth ulceretc. \n\n\n7) Guava leaves decoction or infusion is useful in treating fever, spasm and rheumatism.\n\n\n8) For Diarrhoea, dysentery, colitis and stomach pain : Take fresh Guava leaves , crush them in mortar and pestle. Boil water, add this crushed leaves and dry ginger powder.

    "body": "Hi guys,\n\nI figured there might be some people interested in this as well. I've been enjoying the BHA liquid exfoliant from Paula's Choice which is a bestseller and loved by many on this sub. I noticed they have different formulations of BHA and I've recently gained more interest in antioxidants in skincare. So I compiled a list of all their BHA's to figure out what the difference is. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR :All their exfoliants are nearly the same price, however some of their products contain more ingredients that might be a good addition to your skincare regime, specifically antioxidants and hydrators/skin soothers. HOWEVER, a lot of people who use BHA like to have a product that is not heavy and doesn't add to their oil production. In that case, not all of their products might be suitable for your skin type, even though they contain added antioxidants. \n\nNote: I have not tested any of these products apart of the liquid exfoliant so I can't comment on the consistency but I can make an estimation based on the ingredients.\n\n**Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant**Only contains green tea as an antioxidant and only two hydrators: methylpropanediol and butylene glycol. This consistency is probably the lightest.\n\n**Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Gel Exfoliant**Contains grape fruit extract, green tea and willow herb as antioxidants and only the 2 same hydrators as the liquid. Has added bisabolol (derived from camomile) which is skin soothing. Has a gel texture so might still be suitable for those who want a light consistency like the liquid but added antioxidants.\n\n**Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Lotion Exfoliant**Contains green tea, licorice root extract, oat bran extract and willow herb as antioxidants. Also only contains the two hydrators mentioned above and has added allantoin which is skin soothing and repairing, so is the oat extract. Might be a little heavier than the two above.\n\n**Resist Anti-Aging 2% BHA Exfoliant**Has many added hydrators so might be best suit for dryer skin types which don't tolerate BHA as well. Has nordihydroguaiaretic acid added as the only antioxidant.\n\n**Clear Extra Strength 2% BHA Exfoliant**Again only contains the two hydrators mentioned in the description of the liquid. Only contains green tea as an antioxidant so doesn't seem much different to the liquid to me.\n\n**Clear Regular Strength 2% BHA Exfoliant**Contains many added hydrators and no antioxidants. So my bet would be if you're looking for a more moisturizing BHA go for the resist anti age.

It’s become quite distressing, with visible bald spots and very dry, frizzy strands — even though my scalp gets oily quickly. I’ve seen over 10 dermatologists so far (each with 15+ years of experience), but unfortunately, nothing has helped so far.\n\nTreatments I’ve Tried:\n\nMinoxidil 2% for 6 months last year – saw no major improvement.\n\nFollirich Serum for the last 3 months (ingredients: Butylene glycol, Apigenin, Oleanolic acid, Biotinoyl tripeptide-1, peptides, etc.).\n\nBiograce Supplements – Biotin, Inositol, DL Methionine, etc. (taken for 3 months).\n\nB12 tablets – consistently for the past 3 months.\n\n\nBloodwork:\n\nESR is slightly high at 25 (normal: 10–20)\n\nCholesterol is a bit high\n\nEverything else related to hair health appears normal\n\nI have attached the image of my current meds\n\nAt this point, I’m feeling stuck. I know no one here can diagnose, but I’m just hoping to hear from others who may have had a similar experience — especially those dealing with long-term hairfall that didn’t respond to typical treatments.\n\nHow did you eventually cope with it or manage it? Any lifestyle changes that helped? Emotional support ideas are also welcome — this has taken a toll on my self-confidence.\n\nThank you to this community — it really helps to not feel alone in this.

This is going to take some research in your area to find a doctor that has a very trained eye for this.

The Hairfact Kit is something I've been using for years myself - it's a multivitamin kit and we need those vitamins and trust me our diets - no matter how clean - are not supplying us with the necessary amounts. \n\n2. Diet is THE MOST important factor in hair care and hair loss. I've been on this journey for 12 years now, but finally learnt the lesson that a PCOS sensitive and focused diet is must. \n\n3. Minoxidil is your ride or die. Once you start, you should not stop. I made this mistake a few times and I'm suffering for it. Use minoxidil 5% (I was prescribed Minicheck 5%) and it's effective. But DO NOT STOP and 6 months is nearly not enough time to notice results. 6 months is pure shedding and realignment of your hair's growth cycle. The magic begins after 6 months. But it takes up to a year to really truly SEE the difference. \n\nI'm experiencing THE WORST SHEDDING of my life rn, cus I stopped Mino for a year and lost all the progress I had made over years! So I've had to restart and I've lost 1/2 my volume. I bun my hair cus my braid or pony is worryingly thin!\n\nAlso, idk if you've texted your fasting insulin, that's a key factor in reversing PCOS - if that's what you have. If you're not sure, get all your PCOS tests done for a better understanding of why you're losing hair. \n\nLastly, exercise. MUST. Even a 30 min walk - you have to. 5 times a week at least.",

The simplest way to explain it is that the b3 works like doubled sided tape inside each hair strand and helps the strands reform as one strand. This treatment is only designed to last 6ish weeks, and is not a permanent long term fix.\nAlmost all products sold as a split end “repair” treatment will not actually repair the split ends. They’re most likely smoothing the hair shaft to give the appearance of less split ends, and it washes out when you wash your hair. The emollients concentration in these products is heavy, so they can be very challenging to people with oily hair, because you are essentially adding more oil to the hair.

The products don't have much in the way of actives, but all the ones I have used have been great.\n\nThey seem to focus on soothing, hydrating and moisturising and I personally LOVE all the fruit scents. Here are the items I have used:\n\nHydrate and glow face serum: this is my go-to product for my skin. It has pineapple fruit water, sodium hyaluronate, zinc pca, panthenol, all of which my acne prone dry skin LOVE. I have been using this for almost a year and every time I use it I enjoy it, especially the light pineapple fragrance.\n\n3 in 1 face mist: this is marketed as a makeup fixing spray, but I use it for additional hydration through the day. Watermelon fruit extract, glycerin, enanthia chlorantha bark extract and oleanolic acid all nicely hydrate my skin without being greasy and again, I love the scent.\n\nTinted moisturising cream: this is a makeup hybrid, with a very slight tint and tons of moisturising ingredients. Cactus blossom extract, sodium hyaluronatwle and kaolin give me a nice dewy look without feeling too heavy. It works particularly well when I mix it with my spf 50.\n\n10% avocado lip care peel: not technically part of the hello good stuff range, but a really nice peel that gets rid of dead skin on my lips without feeling too scrubby.\n\nAnybody used any of these?

        "body": "Is this even still available? As far as I was aware, Stemm was discontinued a couple of weeks ago, and the parent company Deciem was selling off their remaining stock at a discounted rate. They’re apparently going to somewhat reformulate the products and bring them back under another brand heading, but idk if they’ve done that yet.\n\nStill, if they have any left and you’re thinking about getting it, here’s my experience so far. I just got the density stimuli like a week ago, after buying it when it became discounted. I use it every night, and the instructions say to use it on a dry scalp, and not to wash it off - so don’t use it directly before or after a shower.\n\nIt’s fairly easy to massage into my head, but it’s definitely a very wet serum, and it takes time to dry, almost an hour if I’ve been liberal with it. The top of my head definitely looks like I’ve just taken a shower after I use it. Its consistency is only slightly thicker than water and it kind of trickles down your head if you don’t immediately massage it in. But at the same time, it’s sticky?! Even after it dries, even in the morning, it feels a bit sticky, which is frustrating if you’ve just washed your hair. But if I brush through the stickiness, it dissipates and my hair looks normal. That’s my biggest complaint about this product - the stickiness makes my hair feel unclean.\n\nIt also has a very natural earthy but medicinal type of smell that doesn’t bother me and that I quite like, but I completely understand if someone else would be bothered by it. The first night I used it, the smell lingered for a while, but on subsequent nights I noticed it less and less, probably because I got used to the scent.\n\nIn terms of effectiveness, this is a serum that’s supposed to increase density of growing, so it needs time to take effect. As I understand it, it probably won’t have much effect on already grown strands of hair. So I need to wait about 3 months before I actually compare before and after. But so far there has been a very strong placebo effect where the morning after, I feel like my scalp is less visible through my hair. Again, probably just a placebo effect, but I like feeling like something is actually working, so that’s why I’ve kept it up.\n\nIn terms of ingredients, I’m most interested in the fact that it has a highly soluble version of caffeine, which has been proven to stimulate hair growth. As for oils, it says in the ingredients list that it has castor oil (which explains the stickiness to me, castor oil is notoriously sticky) so maybe not the best product for you? But also, it’s very low down on the ingredients list, so maybe you can tolerate it??\n\ntbh I’m 50/50 on it so far. I might be more upset if I’d actually paid the original $30+ for it, but since it was about $13 when I bought it, I’m ok with what it’s been doing so far.\n\nHope this helps!",

I said, “Well nowhere in your instructions “How do I make a return” on your website does it say that I had to track the order back to you.” It slyly lists it under “How are refunds processed.” So Instead of asking for tracking, I followed their lousy instructions and just shipped it at the post office and put the Return number with the packing slip in the box, as indicated by your website. They REFUSE to give me a refund now and they won’t call their “3rd party warehouse” to check to see if my package is there! It says Murad on it and the RA number, like figure it out!  I hate companies that make billions of dollars and then screw you over for THEIR problems.

I liked applying this and seeing as I used it during the summers, the post application cool was welcome. \n\nPrior to this, I was using Heimish Watermelon Gel and while it also blended easily, It just felt like any other moisturizer. However, with Nolahour, I could see a glow with daily usage. A good moisturizer always makes you notice that your skin is looking healthier, and this one did. \n\nGiven the price range and quantity, it's a pretty decent.I bought this during a Bogo sale on limese and purchased their Nolahour Toner too. It was a pretty decent toner, no complaints, but nothing extraordinary too.\n\nI'm definitely tempted to buy this during Summers again. I'm no dermatologist, but people with painful acne might like it.\n\n**WRP:** Yes",

It may also improve attention abilities (which I might speculate is due to lowered anxiety). It also has a sedating effect and has been used with valerian as a sleep aid. In regard to your response vs your friends, this may simply be a dose artifact. You may be more sensitive to lower doses for a number of physiological reasons that aren't really illuminating about your brain functioning.

I already have a few broken capillaries at the tender age of 29 and given my dad's 'rosy cheeks', it will only get worse.  I was pretty sure that I'd always have to deal with cheeks that turn purple randomly and feel like they were on fire.\n\nUntil I read up on azelaic acid and decided to give it a try.  I read on SimpleSkinCare that 15% AA was ideal and since Amazon Prime is great, I decided to throw the dice and get the only 15% AA on Amazon, [GIGI Bioplasma Azelaic Cream 15% For Oily Skin](https://www.amazon.com/GIGI-Bioplasma-Azelaic-Cream-1fl-oz/dp/B00MSSJP9Y)\n\nIt was amazing.  It took a month before I saw any kind of difference and I actually gave my Cicapair all the credit until I forgot to put on the AA for 2 weeks and boom, my cheeks were on fire again.  Since going back to it daily, my cheeks are back to normal.\n\nSo here is my question.  I now know that Amazon is a... kind of worrying place to buy cosmetics, since you can't guarantee quality.  Which is a seriously fair concern.  I've looked for alternatives and short of going to a dermatologist here in the US, the best alternative that I can find is [The Ordinary's Azelaic Acid Suspension 10%](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-azelaic-acid-suspension-10pct-30ml).  The price point is legit but I have concerns.\n\nOne issue is that the TO AA has a LOT of reviews about how gummy it is.  My Amazon AA has no such issues.  I hear that the TO AA has to go on last in a routine, which seems strange to me because my Amazon AA deals with other things being on top of it without much issue, so long as it gets enough time to set.\n\nHere are the ingredients:\n\n**TO's Azelaic Acid Suspension 10%**\n>Aqua (Water), Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Dimethicone, Azelaic Acid, Dimethicone/Bis-Isobutyl PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polysilicone-11, Isohexadecane, Tocopherol, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Isoceteth-20, Polysorbate 60, Triethanolamine, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.\n\n**GIGI Bioplasma Azelaic Cream 15% For Oily Skin**\n>Water (Aqua) Azelaic Acid Propylene Glycol Cetearyl Alcohol & Ceteareth - 20 Capric / Capric Triglyceride Glycerin VP/VA Copolymer Butylene Glycol & PEG-60 Almond Glycerides & Caprylyl Glycol & Glycerin & Carbomer & Nordihydroguaiaretic Acid & Oleanolic Acid Xanthan Gum Benzoic Acid a-Bisabolol CI 77492 CI 77491 CI 77499\n\nThe difference in the prices makes my Amazon one about 3x the price but... I trust it and the iffy reviews on the TO product makes me concerned.  SCA, please guide me.",

While that’s not a bad thing, it might not be the best option for your needs. \n\nIf you’re looking for something with more coverage from glossier, the flex concealer is dewy and medium to full coverage. You could use that to spot conceal your rosacea if it’s only in a few areas. \n\nIf you still want that no-makeup look, I would recommend something with slightly more coverage like a tinted moisturizer or cc cream. I swear by the first aid beauty tinted moisturizer, but it can be a bit pricey. Something with even more coverage but still gives that natural finish is the MAC face and body foundation- it’s a bit expensive as well, but it lasts for a really long time and has a similar formula to the glossier tint. \n\nHope this helped!",

    "body": "I came across this and thought I'd post it for you guys. Maybe it will help atleast someone. I found it very interesting. It just lists all or most chemicals that can be used to improve and treat acne. Keep in mind this is the technical chemical name not product name. Only some have brand products made with them. \nFor example clindamycin hydrochloride is the product Clindatech which is in 1% w/v concentration. \n\nEffective acne treatments for mild acne could include a monotherapy of a antibacterial/antibiotic agent or anti-inflammatory agent or anti-histimine and possibly an antioxidant. For example just benzoyl peroxide (antibacterial and anti-inflammatory) may produce satisfactory improvement. \nFor medium or severe acne combination therapy of these agents may be necessary for improvement. For example use of benzoyl peroxide with a topical antibiotic like clindatech and in more severe cases an oral medication like an antibiotic or accutane or spironolactone. Or alternatively a topical tretinion plus other compatible topical preparations and oral/systemic therapies.\n\nSome obviously work better for some people than others. Depends on what the acne is primarily caused by in the individual. Like for example if a woman has acne mostly along jaw line and worse around her period and it's somewhat unresponsive to the usual topical antibacterials/antibiotics and antinflammatories then hormonal medications may improve it. Like an estrogen dominant pill with an anti-androgen like Estelle 35 and/or with spironolactone and possibly extra topical treatments (benzoyl peroxide + clindatech +/or acid combos or topical retinoid). \n\nAntibacterial/Antibiotic Agents:\nBenzoyl peroxide,  bacitracin, polymyxin B, neomycin, mupirocin, hydrastine, aminopropanesulphonic acid, acetohydroxamic acid, actinonin,

    "body": "Oleanolic acid (OA) is a pentacyclic triterpenoid compound used clinically for acute and chronic hepatitis. However, high dose or long-term use of OA causes hepatotoxicity, which limits its clinical application. Hepatic Sirtuin (SIRT1) participates in the regulation of FXR signaling and maintains hepatic metabolic homeostasis. \n\nThis study was designed to determine whether SIRT1/FXR signaling pathway contributes to the hepatotoxicity caused by OA. C57BL/6J mice were administered with OA for 4 consecutive days to induce hepatotoxicity. \n\nThe results showed that OA suppressed the expression of FXR and its downstream targets CYP7A1, CYP8B1, BSEP and MRP2 at both mRNA and protein levels, breaking the homeostasis of bile acid leading to hepatotoxicity. However, treatment with FXR agonist GW4064 noticeably attenuated hepatotoxicity caused by OA. \n\nFurthermore, it was found that OA inhibited protein expression of SIRT1. Activation of SIRT1 by its agonist SRT1720 significantly improved OA-induced hepatotoxicity. \n\nThese results suggested that OA may cause hepatotoxicity through SIRT1 dependent suppression of FXR signaling pathway. In vitro experiments confirmed that OA suppressed protein expressions of FXR and its targets through inhibition of SIRT1.\n\nIn conclusion, our study reveals that SIRT1/FXR pathway is crucial in OA-induced hepatotoxicity. Activation of SIRT1/HNF1α/FXR axis may represent a novel therapeutic target for ameliorating OA and other herb-induced hepatotoxicity. \n\nFrom:[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0041008X23001485](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0041008X23001485)",

It should be applied directly to the scalp area in the amount as advised by your doctor.  This medication must be used continuously to maintain hair growth. If your condition does not improve or worsens after using it for 4 to 6 months, consult your doctor\n\nAnasure solution is safe and suitable. The common side effects are itching or irritation of the scalp and unwanted hair growth in other places (not your scalp). It is a potassium channel opener vasodilatation action expands the blood vessels. Therefore, when it is applied to the scalp, it helps to increase the blood flow. This increased blood flow provides more nutrition and oxygen to the hair follicles, which prevents hair cell death and also enhances new hair growth used to treat your alopecia (hair loss).",

    "body": "\"Abstract:\n\n\n\nBackground: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among diabetic patients, with their incidence rising globally. Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats, untreated with insulin, exhibit human-like symptoms such as hyperglycemia, polydipsia, polyuria, weight loss, cardiomyopathy, neuropathy, and oxidative stress. \n\nThus, this study evaluated the effects of Ilex guayusa tea on cardiovascular, autonomic, metabolic, and oxidative stress parameters in diabetic rats, as well as its antioxidant and phytochemical properties. \n\nMethods: Thirteen female Wistar rats were divided into two groups: diabetic (D; n = 7) and diabetic + Ilex guayusa (DG; n = 6). Diabetes was induced by a single STZ injection (50 mg/kg, i.v.), and guayusa tea was provided ad libitum for 21 days (3.0 g/L). \n\nResults: Glycemia and body mass were initially similar between the groups; however, throughout the protocol, the D group showed an increase in glycaemia and a decrease in body mass when compared to initial values. While no differences in arterial pressure, heart rate, linear heart rate variability, and oxidative stress were observed, the D group showed reduced vascular sympathetic modulation (LF-SAP and VAR-SAP) compared to the DG group. \n\nThis reduced vascular sympathetic modulation, which was a poor prognostic marker in this model, was inversely correlated with glycemia (VAR-SAP and final glycemia, r: −0.81, p = 0.002). Conclusions: These findings suggest that Ilex guayusa tea consumption may mitigate metabolic and autonomic dysfunction in diabetes, highlighting its potential therapeutic role in managing diabetic complications.\n\n  \n...\n\n  \nDiscussion:\n\n\n\nIn this study, we assessed the antioxidant and phytochemical profile of Ilex guayusa tea, as well as the cardiovascular and metabolic effects of its consumption in female STZ-induced diabetic rats. In fact, we were able to confirm its high antioxidant properties and demonstrate the beneficial effects of Ilex guayusa tea consumption on glycemic control and autonomic modulation in these animals.\n\n\n\nAs demonstrated by others, we also observed high antioxidant properties of Ilex guayusa tea, measured by four different methods: TRAP, ABTS, DPPH, and RP. These findings align with previous studies that highlight the significant antioxidant capacity of Ilex guayusa, attributed to its rich polyphenolic and flavonoid content \\[7,12\\]. \n\nGarcia-Ruiz et al. \\[12\\] identified a total of 14 phenolic compounds in Ilex guayusa, with chlorogenic acid and quercetin-3-O-hexose being the main representatives of hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonols, respectively. Additionally, lutein, the most abundant carotenoid in Ilex guayusa, contributes to its antioxidant properties \\[13\\].\n\nInterestingly, flavonoids, such as quercetin-3-O-hexose, exhibit potent antidiabetic properties by modulating key processes involved in carbohydrate digestion, insulin signaling, secretion, glucose uptake, and adipose tissue deposition \\[14\\]. These compounds influence multiple molecular targets, regulating critical pathways that enhance β-cell proliferation, stimulate insulin secretion, reduce β-cell apoptosis, and alleviate hyperglycemia by optimizing glucose metabolism in the liver \\[15\\]. \n\nChlorogenic acid, another major compound in Ilex guayusa, has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce blood glucose levels by inhibiting glucose-6-phosphatase, an enzyme involved in hepatic glucose production \\[16\\]. These mechanisms suggest that the polyphenolic and flavonoid content of Ilex guayusa may play a significant role in its antidiabetic effects.\n\nTo further explore these effects, we investigated the impact of Ilex guayusa consumption on glucose levels in female STZ-induced diabetic rats. Although the decoction method demonstrated superior in vitro antioxidant activity and higher total phenolic and flavonoid contents compared to the infusion, we chose the infusion method for its practicality and feasibility in real-world applications. At baseline, both experimental groups exhibited similar levels of hyperglycemia. \n\nHowever, over the course of the study, the diabetic control group (D) experienced a progressive increase in glycemia, which was mitigated in the Ilex guayusa-treated group (DG). This hypoglycemic effect in the DG group may be attributed to the high polyphenol and flavonoid content of Ilex guayusa tea, consistent with prior findings by Swanston-Flatt et al. \\[17\\], who demonstrated that Ilex guayusa delayed hyperglycemia development in STZ-induced diabetic rats while also reducing hyperphagia, polydipsia, weight loss, and glycated hemoglobin levels.\n\n\n\nMoreover, triterpenoids such as oleanolic acid and ursolic acid, which have been isolated from Ilex guayusa \\[18\\], are known to enhance glucose tolerance and insulin secretion, further supporting its antidiabetic potential \\[19,20\\]. These compounds, along with the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of Ilex guayusa, contribute to its multifaceted role in diabetes management.\n\n\n\nGiven the strong association between DM and CVD, we next evaluated the hemodynamic and cardiovascular autonomic modulation parameters of these animals. No differences in arterial pressure, heart rate, or linear heart rate variability were detected between the groups. However, Ilex guayusa tea consumption (DG group) prevented the reduction in vascular sympathetic modulation, as indicated by lower LF-SAP and VAR-SAP, as seen in the D group. \n\nIn fact, previous research, including our own, has consistently shown diminished vascular sympathetic modulation in STZ-induced diabetic rats \\[9,10,11\\]. Decreased autonomic modulation has long been recognized as an early marker of autonomic neuropathy in diabetes, often preceding overt symptoms or other manifestations of neuropathy \\[21\\]. Pathophysiologically, it is associated with impaired parasympathetic regulation by the vagus nerve, the longest autonomic nerve. This impairment occurs in a length-dependent manner, similar to the damage observed in peripheral somatic nerves affected by diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy \\[22\\]. \n\nRemarkably, this reduction, also considered a poor prognostic marker in this animal model of diabetes, was inversely correlated with glycemia. The significant inverse correlation between VAR-SAP and blood glucose levels observed in this study reinforces the notion that the metabolic derangements of diabetes are closely linked to autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular impairment, characterized by the uncoupling of heart rate and blood pressure. \n\nHowever, these findings do not rule out the potential involvement of other central or peripheral control mechanisms in the pathophysiology of diabetes. Notably, Fiorino et al. \\[9\\] observed that green tea consumption also prevents VAR-SAP and LF-SAP reduction while improving glycemic control.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the STZ-induced diabetic rats treated with guayusa tea presented higher alpha 1, a non-linear analysis of HRV that belongs to detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). DFA is a random-walk analytical method designed for analyzing nonstationary time-series data, first introduced by Peng et al. in 1995 \\[23\\]. \n\nIn healthy individuals, HRV exhibits long-range power-law correlations, a fractal property resulting from the complex control mechanisms of heart rate regulation \\[24\\]. This regulation is mediated by the dynamic balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activity, which influences both sinus node automaticity and atrioventricular node conduction. In the context of HRV analysis, DFA is commonly used to assess the autocorrelation function associated with heart rate regulation \\[23\\]. \n\nThe scaling exponents derived from DFA offer insights into the system’s functionality. An exponent close to 1 suggests 1/f fluctuations, indicative of healthy and adaptive heart rate regulation. \n\nIn contrast, a reduction in the scaling exponent reflects increased randomness, signaling pathological heart rate dysregulation and an impaired ability to respond to external disturbances. For example, Mizobuchi et al. \\[25\\] observed that patients with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction presented an alpha 1 that was 27% lower than control subjects. \n\nOur group has also demonstrated that obese/diabetic mice (ob/ob) present a reduction of 43% in alpha 1 when compared to control lean mice \\[26\\].\n\n\n\nDespite the high antioxidant levels of Ilex guayusa, no differences were observed between the groups regarding cardiac and brain oxidative stress. Perchance, a longer study period involving Ilex guayusa tea and an experimental diabetes model could reveal more significant changes from the perspective of oxidative stress.\n\n\n\nAlthough this study offers novel insights into the potential benefits of Ilex guayusa tea on autonomic and metabolic parameters in diabetic rats, it has several limitations. First, the absence of a healthy, nondiabetic control group may restrict the generalizability of the findings. While published baseline data for nondiabetic animals were referenced to provide context, including such a group would have offered a more robust comparison. \n\nSecond, the chemical composition of the Ilex guayusa extracts was not fully characterized to identify specific bioactive compounds, limiting the ability to link individual phytochemicals to the observed effects. Third, while the infusion method was chosen for its translational relevance, the decoction showed greater in vitro antioxidant activity and phenolic/flavonoid content, which may have influenced the outcomes. \n\nLastly, histopathological analyses were not conducted, as tissue samples were prioritized for oxidative profile assessments. Future studies should address these gaps by including euglycemic groups, performing detailed phytochemical analyses, and integrating histopathological evaluations to enhance the interpretation and applicability of the findings.\n\n\n\nThese findings suggest that Ilex guayusa tea holds promise as an adjuvant therapy for diabetes mellitus, improving glycemic control and mitigating autonomic dysfunction. Further human studies are needed to optimize its use and evaluate its synergistic potential with pharmacological treatments.\"",

Every married women worship to this plant for healthy life of all family. It is one of the best medicinal herb. It has many medicinal characteristics such as antibacterial, antifungal, antipyretic, antioxidant, antiseptic, antiinflammatory, anthelmintic, antiallergic and anticancer. Tulsi is also called as 'QUEEN OF HERBS'\n\n\nSpiritual value of tulsi in India:\n\nIt is the most worshipped plant in India. Every indian women in every morning after the bath do worship to these plant. Tulsi is a sacred plant for Hindus and is worshipped as the avatar of Lakshmi. Traditionally, tulsi is planted in the centre of the central courtyard of Hindu houses. Leaves and flowers of these plant are used to worship the god Vishnu and it's avtar\n There is another ceremony related to Tulsi, that is Tulsi vivah which is done after the Diwali in Karthik poornima.\n\n\n\n\nVitamin and mineral content in basil(Tulsi):\n\nTulsi consists of lots of vitamin, minerals, essential oil and chemical compounds\n• Vitamins: A, B1, B2, B3, B5, B9, C, E, K, B6, choline\n\n• Minerals: potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus\n-Minerals in which are in small amount: sodium (very less than potassium), iron, magnese, copper, zinc, selenium, Mercury\n\n• chemical compounds: Some of the phytochemical constituents of tulsi are oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, rosmarinic acid, eugenol, carvacrol, linalool, β-caryophyllene (about 8%).\n\n• essential oil: eugenol (~70%) β-elemene (~11.0%), β-caryophyllene (~8%) and germacrene (~2%), with the balance being made up of various trace compounds, mostly terpenes.\n\n\n\nSome important properties of Tulsi:\n\n• Tulsi is considered to be an adaptogen, balancing different processes in the body, and helpful for adapting to stress. \n\n• Marked by its strong aroma and astringent taste, it is regarded in Ayurveda as a kind of ‘elixir of life’ and believed to promote longevity.\n\n• Traditionally, O. sanctum L. is taken in many forms, as herbal tea, dried power or fresh leaf.\n\n• basil has antidepressant and anti-anxiety properties comparable to diazepam and antidepressant drugs.\n\n      - Tip: drink holy basil as tea using the leaves daily every morning on empty stomach\n\n\n\n1) Medicinal use of Tulsi\n\n\nwhole plant of Ocimum sanctum Linn.( Tulsi) have been recommended for the treatment of bronchitis, malaria, diarrhea, dysentery, skin disease, arthritis, eye diseases, insect bites and so on.\n\n\n2) Relieves Fever\n\nTulsi leaves act as antibiotic, germicidal and disinfectant agents; protects you from bacteria and viruses. Tulsi is an antipyretic - it helps fight a fever and recover your health quickly.\n\n\n3) Relieves Cough and Respiratory Problems\n\nChewing Tulsi leaves relives cough and flu. Having antibacterial, antiseptic properties, it can fight against many infection and also helps to mobilize mucus in bronchitis and asthma attacks.\n\nTip: chew Tulsi leaves regularly.\n\n\n4) Protects Against Heart Disorder\n\nTulsi is very beneficial in fighting cardiac disease.

The hairy roots were identified for the rooting genes loci of rolA and rolB by polymerase chain reaction.\n\nFor studying the secondary metabolite production, the n-hexane extract of the hairy roots was prepared and the compounds were isolated by silica gel column chromatography, affording triterpenoids (ursolic acid and oleanolic acid) and phytosterols (beta-sitosterol and stigmasterol). The shoots from the hairy root cultures were regenerated and differentiated to the plantlets. For micropropagation, shoot multiplication was successfully induced from the axillary buds of the regenerated plantlets in WPM supplemented with 0.1 mg/l thidiazuron.\n\nThe mitragynine contents of 5-month-old regenerated plants and in vitro plantlets (germinated from seeds) were determined using the TLC-densitometric method. The regenerated plants contained (14.25 +/- 0.25) mg/g dry wt mitragynine, whereas the in vitro plantlets contained (4.45 +/- 0.09) mg/g dry wt.\n\nSource - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19040109",

    "body": "Long post so please bear with me!!!\nSo a few months ago, around oct-2021, my skin was so so clear. I just had a little inflammation from the acne that I had 5 years ago and in addition to that, I just had 1-2 pimples.\nNow I feel like the biggest mistake I made was that I went to this famous dermatologist. So many girls had such good reviews that I thought that he'll be the perfect one.\nAt that point, I had no knowledgs of actives like bp, adapelene, tretinoin, isotretinoin etc.\nEven though most of my skin was clear, the first prescription he gave me was:\n\nAM: facewash, Clindamycin gel only on spots, \nPM: facewash, isotretinoin+erythromycin gel and that too only to be applied on spots\n\nI was also prescribed Azithromycin tablet 250 mg twice a day. \n\nNote that the facewash he gave me also was very harsh since the active ingredients in it were lactic acid, oleanolic acid and ndga.\n\nI mentioned moisturizer to him but he kept refusing.\n\nNow guess what happened? Something I didn't expect. After a few months, I started getting more and more acne. He kept toggling between Clindamycin and Fuicidin gel. \n\nI kept going to him and complaining bout acne but he kept blaming my periods and stuff.\nI know I had some acne 5 years ago (I was 19) but it was gone a long time ago. For the 4 years of my university life, I used to sweat a lot and had so much stress in my life but I still never got even one pimple.\n\nAll my life, I never even used a facewash, I had no knowledge of skincare, all I used to do was splash my face with water and that's it. Really. I had one facewash that I only used after removing makeup.\nEven after no skincare, my skin was still not breaking out so why now? Even I was using local cheap makeup but even that didn't break me out. \nSo now, in my current phase of life, why is everything breaking me out? This started happening a few months after following my derm. My skin has become so acne prone now. Everything including expensive and high quality makeup, sunscreens, moisturizers, everything breaks me out now.\nIt has only been a few months and my face has completely changed.\nBut I am just never able to argue much with him because maybe he has a way of words that just shuts you.\nLast time I went to him and complained about everything, he replaced Clindamycin again with fucidin but now replaced isotretinoin gel with tretinoin+clindamycin gel (and this too only to be applied on active spots). He also gave me a new facewash and said to use both alternatively. But I am thinking to stick to the second one because it feels like it's less harsh and less stripping.\n\nSo my new routine is\nAM: facewash, fucidin gel (for spots only)\nPM: facewash, tret+clinda gel only (for spots only)\n\nThis is an everyday routine and it has been a week already. Even though tret+clinda spot treatment might do something good in a few days, it definitely has made me feel like my acne pimples are wounds. I feel like that because they hurt now. One of them bled yesterday so I didn't apply anything on it.\n\nStill didn't prescribe me a moisturizer but I wanted to get one myself now. I have already tried cerave moisturizing cream and cerave am moisturizer but they broke me out so so badly. Now after a lot of research, I bought Clinique DDMG. I am so scared that I want to patch test even this gel. \n\nI also have a concern that I feel like everything might have happened because the derm damaged my skin's moisture barrier. Although I don't have much knowledge of this topic. Any comments on this?\n\nI don't really know what advice I am looking for but I'll be happy with as much advice as possible.\n\nYou guys can help me make a better routine or can help me make better choices. I don't know why I still go to this derm but I feel like he might have done some sort of magic on me :D I still want to try his tret+clinda spot treatment and see the results.\n\nNote: I am more depressed and frustrated because I have a very very important event to attend in a month or so. It's for a week so I can't wear makeup all the time and I am very very insecure right now. \nThe event's close so I can't accept anything that can cause purging.\nPlease don't tell me to just accept my skin as it is. No I don't want to. It's making me feel suicidal.\nI was willing to spend my hard earned money on my skin but I didn't expect these bad results. Now I am still willing to spend but for good results only :'(\nAlso I live in a country where I don't get much of the products that are mentioned in this subreddit :(\n\nEdit: So from a week, my skin has also started feeling itchy, why would that happen?\n\nThank you",

Last year I tried SVR Sebiaclear SPF50+ and I had (almost?) no breakouts, BUT the texture is kinda heavy/sticky (at the beginning, at least) and plus I don't like it has homosalate and octinaxate.\n\nI've read wonderful things about LRP Anthelios Ultra SPF50+ Fragrance Free, but I'm worried because of the alcohol denat. in it (and one LRP sunscreen I used in the past was my worst sunscreen experience: whitecast, pilling, breakouts), especially considering I should use it everyday in spring and in summer.\n\nI'm also interested in Bionike sunscreens, especially into two types for oily and acne prone skins; the problem is there is octinoxate in them.\n\nNow, my question is: is alcohol denat. a bad choice when it comes to an everyday product?

Now, bile acid is required by the body for the digestion of fat. To produce this bile acid, the body uses cholesterol, which is present in the body. Because cholesterol is being used for the synthesis of bile acid, its concentration in the blood decreases and hence, the overall blood cholesterol level is reduced.\n\n\n4) Take unripe guava.

Microemulsions and topical serum formulation containing C. militaris extract were developed. \n\nThe anti-skin wrinkle efficacy and irritation properties of the topical serum formulations were clinically investigated in human volunteers. Cordycepin was identified as a major component of C. miliaris extract that was responsible for MMP-1, elastase, and hyaluronidase inhibition.\n\nThe C. miliaris water extract possessed the most potent inhibition on MMP-1 (77.9 ± 5.3%) and elastase (84.4 ± 4.0%). Interestingly, CW was as a potent MMP-1 and elastase inhibitor as oleanolic acid and EGCG. CW was incorporated into the microemulsion with the smallest internal droplet size (146.1 ± 1.5 nm) and further developed as a topical serum formulation. \n\nThe resulting serum formulation effectively enhanced skin moisture (42.2 ± 14.2%), increased the skin elasticity (39.9 ± 7.3%), and induced no skin irritation in 30 human volunteers. The effectiveness on the skin was detected after 1 week of the applications. \n\nTherefore, it was suggested as an effective anti-skin wrinkle formulation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom :\n\n\\- [https://europepmc.org/article/ppr/ppr354132](https://europepmc.org/article/ppr/ppr354132)",

I found that it too provided relief. I stopped using it due to what I read in the guides in this subreddit---I decided to try coal tar shampoo to get rid of the scaling first, and then try the Natural Moisturizing serum to keep my scalp moisturized. The coal tar shampoo has worked wonders. The scaling disappeared and so did the itch after the first time using the shampoo. I've used it 3 times in the past 10 days. Today was a hair wash day but I didn't use the coal tar shampoo. I used one with oat milk and aloe vera. Since I have dry hair, I used a heavy conditioner (I don't apply conditioner to my head so I don't get any on my scalp). Before I blow dried my hair, I applied the hair serum to my scalp and massage it in. I am hoping the serum will keep me itch free. \n\n\nIf you could provide an update if the serum you're using continues to work, that would be great.",

Just to note, always had a little seb derm on my face since my teens, mostly mild red patches on and off, and dry flakiness. Anyway I tried that lumin skin trial program that always pops up on insta, for a week or so, as well as applying minox twice day. I don't know what happened but had a bad reaction to the minox every time I applied after that week, like redness followed by small yellowish scab cover, a little oozing underneath too, to the areas I applied.  Never put any of that Lumin stuff on again and gave my face a break for like a month, tried again, same result, 2 month break and the same, and then once more after a 3 month break, exact same result. Totally bizarre, cause used it with no issues for like half a year almost. The rash and resulting scab sucked - stung, itched, then felt super taut and cracked until it fully healed, like 10 days or so it took. So I might have to give up on the foam. I have a feeling it's the alcohol so had a good look at all the posts on here bout non alcohol minox options i think, gel and creams were mentioned but those seem harder to source, this seems the easiest to get my hands on;\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/LamFun-Professional-Treatment-Minoxidil-Alcohol-Free/dp/B0871W4JDK/ref=sr\\_1\\_5?crid=2N4KX2907YPH2&dchild=1&keywords=minoxidil+no+alcohol&qid=1623917159&sprefix=Minoxidil+non+al%2Caps%2C370&sr=8-5](https://www.amazon.com/LamFun-Professional-Treatment-Minoxidil-Alcohol-Free/dp/B0871W4JDK/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2N4KX2907YPH2&dchild=1&keywords=minoxidil+no+alcohol&qid=1623917159&sprefix=Minoxidil+non+al%2Caps%2C370&sr=8-5)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThoughts on this brand?

    "body": " \n\nYou’ve probably heard the saying, you are what you eat. There’s a lot of truth in that statement: your teeth and gums need sustenance to stay healthy just like any other part of the body does. That means if we’re not giving our mouth enough nutrients it can get ugly pretty quickly with tooth decay or gum disease (yikes).  \n\nWhat you eat can affect more than just your waistline. You also need to think about what foods are good for the health of your mouth! When we drink and eat starchy or sugary food, it creates acid which then unleashes an attack on your teeth for over twenty minutes after you’re done eating. Now, if this happens over time then the hard enamel on our teeth will be damaged, causing them to become more vulnerable than before- making it much easier for cavities and [gum disease](https://www.surbitondental.co.uk/treatment/gum-disease/) to spread. \n\nEating nutrient-rich foods from all food groups promotes both [dental health](https://www.surbitondental.co.uk/about/) as well as overall body wellness. So maintain a balanced diet including fruits, vegetables, protein sources, calcium-rich foods such as dairy products or leafy green veggies like spinach whole grains etcetera in order to keep those pearly whites shining bright. \n\n***WHAT ARE THE FOODS YOU SHOULD EAT TO STRENGTHEN AND MAINTAIN ORAL HEALTH?***\n\nStudies show that “people without access to affordable [dental care](https://www.surbitondental.co.uk/treatment/dental-hygiene/) have significantly higher rates of oral disease. 9 out of 10 people experience tooth decay (cavities), and it remains the most common chronic childhood disease”.\n\nMany people who have unhealthy teeth often wonder what the best foods are for dental health. Unfortunately, many believe that a healthy diet is all about avoiding sweets and sugary drinks because they cause tooth decay. In reality, there’s plenty of great food out there which can help your mouth stay clean and strong! One perfect example would be fresh fruits or vegetables with their high nutritional value as well as added benefits when it comes to keeping teeth squeaky-clean.    \n\nFrom fresh fruit and vegetable diets that maintain healthy teeth to Low-fat milk, yogurt or cheese that offers the much-needed calcium, we will show you the foods you must eat to strengthen and maintain healthy teeth. Plus, we will show you the crunchy food items you should munch on to get the saliva going which helps clean away plaque-causing bacteria along with food particles clinging onto your pearly whites.  \n\n* **CHEESE IS THE BEST FRIEND TO YOUR TEETH** \n\nCheese is awesome for healthy teeth and there are a number of reasons why. First, it’s low in sugar and high in calcium content so your teeth will be strong as can be. Secondly, cheese contains casein which helps fortify tooth enamel by strengthening the protein matrix of our bones because they’re made mostly out of proteins too! And lastly- chewing on some delicious cheddar also increases saliva production to wash away any bacteria from all that smiling we do when eating this great food. \n\nYour teeth will thank you for drinking milk. It’s rich in calcium and other important elements that can strengthen your bones and help protect you from tooth decay, so drink up your yoghurt. Yoghurt also contains probiotics that can improve oral health and even make bad breath better with its natural deodorizing effects. \n\n* **BITE INTO THESE CRUNCHY VEGETABLES** \n\nCrunchy vegetables are great for your teeth, and you should make sure to eat them as often as possible. Crunching on these hard foods will help scrub away food particles and bacteria while also stimulating the flow of saliva that helps cleanse each tooth surface. These fresh crunchy veggies usually contain some of the most important minerals and vitamins needed in a healthy mouth.      \n\nCelery’s crunchy nature is the closest thing to natural dental floss and has been proven effective for [teeth cleaning](https://www.surbitondental.co.uk/). Carrots are also packed with nutrients that help fight cavities, in addition to being a vegetable full of goodness like vitamin C, calcium and keratins. They offer oral health benefits by washing away bacteria from food particles on your teeth while you chew them up. \n\nWhen combined with saliva these vegetables scrape harmful plaque off tooth surfaces as well as organically removing staining compounds caused by tannin-rich foods.  \n\n* **EAT APPLES AND PEARS TO PREVENT TOOTH DECAY** \n\nWhat’s better than an apple a day? An apple every hour of the day! The sweet crunchy texture makes it hard to resist, but luckily apples have some major health benefits for your teeth too. Studies show that chewing on fibrous foods like fruits and veggies can stimulate saliva production which helps neutralize those damaging acids from our daily diets. Apples are no exception- you could chew one as often as once per hour (just make sure they’re not super juicy or sugary).\n\nFor a healthy treat, try delicious pears. They are both refreshing and filling with their high water content that dilutes sugar from its natural fruit sugars to make for an excellent snack or dessert option. They can easily satisfy those sugar cravings without putting you at risk for cavities like sugary or starchy treats might do. So the next time you’re feeling too acidic, reach for a pear! This fruit has the ability to neutralize acids in your mouth that cause decay. \n\n* **ARE NUTS REALLY GOOD FOR YOUR TEETH?**\n\nThe world of nuts is rife with the potential for improving your dental health. Eating nuts can actually help you keep your teeth healthy. Cashews, almonds and brazil nuts are a few of the most beneficial types for fighting bacteria that lead to tooth decay because they contain calcium D which helps with both teeth and gums. Nuts also offer many other benefits such as vitamins D, E, B6, iron and zinc just to name a few. For instance, peanuts offer good amounts of calcium which is a great guard against the enamel loss caused by acid erosion from sugar consumption or excess brushing without sufficient water intake – helping you maintain healthy gums. \n\nNuts that should be eaten include almonds which have high levels of calcium for teeth health.\n\nCashews stimulate salivation while walnuts give you fibre among many nutrients needed for the mouth. Nuts are a healthy snack for any time of the day, as they not only provide protein but also help strengthen teeth. The crunchy nuts can remove bacteria deposits and keep your mouth fresh. A fun way to do this is with some crunchy nuts sprinkled on top or mixed into salad dressings, side dishes or appetizers. It’s an easy step towards eating foods that maintain good teeth hygiene every single day.  \n\n* **WATER IS THE HEALTHIEST DRINK FOR YOUR TEETH** \n\nWhile this one isn’t a food, we thought it would be a crime not to mention it. Drinking water is the healthiest choice available. 60% of our bodies are made of it and staying hydrated helps our system distribute healthy nutrients, get rid of waste in a more efficient manner, gives your skin a healthy glow while keeping muscles moving with ease. Not only does drinking water help keep teeth healthier but also protects them against cavities. Fluoride in drinking water is being touted as nature’s cavity fighter. It can be an easy and beneficial way to help prevent cavities, and it may even do more than just that. \n\nWater not only cleanses food particles off our tongues to prevent bad breath but it keeps saliva levels high which prevents dry mouth syndrome. The problem with sugary drinks is that they both rot your teeth and make you gain weight. But studies have shown people who drink water are more likely to lose weight! So the next time you need a beverage, grab yourself some H2O instead of anything else on the menu for healthy hair and skin from head-to-toe!\n\n* **CAN EATING MEAT AND FISH STRENGTHEN YOUR TEETH?** \n\nEveryone knows that chewing food increases the saliva in your mouth which decreases acidity and washes away particles of food. Studies show that red meat is an even better option than we originally thought. It turns out to also have high levels of phosphorus for protecting tooth enamel.  \n\nWhat’s your favourite food? Fish! \n\nNow, fish are not just your typical dinner entrée – these healthy little creatures pack quite the punch when it comes to dental care. \n\nFatty fish like wild salmon, tuna, Atlantic herring and mackerel are great sources of Omega 3 fish oils and Vitamin D. The more you maintain a healthy diet, the less likely your teeth will rot or decay. Fish and meat products rank high on this list because they provide nutrients to strengthen bones as well as protect against dental disease. Salmon is an excellent source of Omega 3 fatty acids that help prevent gum diseases while also promoting heart health due to its Vitamin D content.\n\n* **KEEP TOOTH DECAY AT BAY BY EATING CRANBERRIES AND RAISINS** \n\nCranberries are one of the most popular and healthy fruits. They have a lot in common with tea, containing polyphenols that help fight plaque buildup on teeth. Fresh cranberries work best at disrupting this process but be mindful to check labels for added sugar if you’re buying dried ones as it can really hurt your tooth enamel instead.   \n\nRaisins benefit your teeth.[A study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/06/050608061403.htm)from Science Daily suggests that raisins may actually be a good teeth-saving, cavity-fighting snack. Researchers at the University of Illinois in Chicago found that raisin compounds work to fight teeth decay and gum disease by inhibiting growth in two species: Streptococcus mutans which causes cavities and Porphyromonas gingivalis which is responsible for periodontal diseases such as gingivitis or bleeding from exposed roots due to poor [oral hygiene](https://www.surbitondental.co.uk/treatment/dental-hygiene/). The oleanolic acid in raisins not only suppresses the growth of oral bacteria, but also attacks them. This is great news for people who want to keep their teeth and gums healthy. \n\n* **HOW STRAWBERRIES CAN MAINTAIN YOUR ORAL HEALTH**\n\nAs we touched on earlier, in order to maintain healthy teeth, it is important that you eat fruits and veggies rich in Vitamin C. For example, apples have high levels of this nutrient as do pears while strawberries are a good source of antioxidants such as malic acid which helps with discolouration or stains on the teeth. A diet rich in Vitamin C can help prevent cavities, tooth loss and gum disease. Strawberries are packed with Vitamin C which helps strengthen collagen found within the dentin layer of teeth. \n\nStrawberries contain malic acid that has been shown to whiten your teeth naturally as it is metabolized by oral bacteria. This same acid also increases saliva production in people with dry mouths, protecting against tooth decay because it washes away food debris from the surface of our mouths. Make sure you eat plenty of fresh fruits such as apples, pears, strawberries and pineapples for healthy gums while maintaining a whiter smile.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nIn addition to following a healthy diet, good dental hygiene practices such as brushing your teeth with fluoride toothpaste twice daily and flossing once every day can help keep you from developing cavities. Drinking fluoridated water will also aid in maintaining strong enamel on your teeth for the long term. It’s important that you seek [regular dental visits](https://www.surbitondental.co.uk/treatment/comprehensive-dental-examination/) so that any problems are caught early before they become more serious or painful. ",

    "body": "Gray hair has long been considered an inevitable sign of aging. However, emerging research in **molecular biology** and **herbal pharmacology** suggests it may be possible to **restore natural hair color** by targeting the biological mechanisms behind pigment loss — without using synthetic dyes.\n\nAt HairMayraki, we integrate **scientific innovation** with **evidence-based botanical medicine** to address gray hair from its root cause: **melanocyte inactivity**.\n\n# 🧠 The Biology of Hair Pigmentation\n\nHair color is determined by the presence of **melanin**, produced by **melanocytes** located in the hair bulb adjacent to **dermal papilla cells**. These melanocytes transfer melanin to **keratinocytes**, which form the structure of the hair shaft. This melanin synthesis process is regulated by several key molecular pathways.\n\nThe most studied among them is the **MC1R/MITF/tyrosinase axis**:\n\n* **MC1R (Melanocortin 1 Receptor)**: A G-protein-coupled receptor on the melanocyte surface activated by alpha-MSH (α-melanocyte stimulating hormone).\n* **MITF (Microphthalmia-associated Transcription Factor)**: A master transcriptional regulator that promotes melanocyte survival and melanin gene expression.\n* **Tyrosinase**: The rate-limiting enzyme in the melanin synthesis pathway, converting tyrosine into DOPA and subsequently into melanin.\n\n“Melanin synthesis in melanocyte or melanoma cells is mainly regulated by the MC1R/MITF/tyrosinase-signaling pathway.”  \n— *Journal of Advanced Pharmaceutical Technology & Research, 2020*  \n[Link to study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7014288/)\n\nWhen melanocytes downregulate this pathway—either due to aging, oxidative stress, or genetic predisposition—the result is **melanin depletion** and visible **gray or white hair**, clinically referred to as **canities**.\n\n# 🔬 Can This Process Be Reversed?\n\nTraditional hair dye merely conceals the absence of melanin. However, an alternative approach—**melanocyte reactivation**—aims to **restore natural melanin production** at the follicular level.\n\nRecent developments in **botanical pharmacology** have identified a number of herbs with the ability to stimulate melanogenesis via MC1R activation, promote melanocyte regeneration, and enhance intracellular tyrosinase activity.\n\nOne such example is **Polygonum Multiflorum Thunb.** (*He Shou Wu*), widely used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and now backed by **modern pharmacological studies**.\n\nPolygonum Multiflorum has been shown to stimulate melanogenesis in B16F10 melanocytes by upregulating tyrosinase, TRP-1, and MITF gene expression.  \n— *Phytomedicine Journal, 2015*\n\n# 🌿 The Herbal Science Behind Mayraki's Anti-Gray Hair Color Restoring Treatment\n\nOur [**Anti-Gray Hair Color Restoring Treatment**](https://hairmayraki.com/anti-grey-hair-color-restoring-treatment/) is formulated based on **molecular-level targeting** of melanin pathways, combined with traditional knowledge of **melanocyte-supporting herbs**.\n\nIt includes a synergistic blend of:\n\n# 🔬 1. Polygonum Multiflorum Root Extract\n\n* **Scientific role**: Induces MC1R expression and increases tyrosinase activity in melanocytes.\n* **Traditional use**: Blood and kidney tonic in TCM; historically used for reversing premature graying.\n\n# 🔬 2. Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Extract\n\n* **Scientific role**: Inhibits DHT, improves microvascular blood flow to the follicle, promotes expression of melanogenic factors.\n* **Clinical insight**: Shown to enhance pigmentation and prolong the anagen phase of the hair cycle.\n\n# 🔬 3. Ligustrum Lucidum Extract\n\n* **Scientific role**: Contains oleanolic acid and flavonoids that protect melanocytes from oxidative damage.\n* **Traditional use**: TCM liver and kidney tonic; used to improve hair vitality and pigment.\n\n# 🔬 4. Coffea Arabica Extract\n\n* **Scientific role**: Stimulates hair shaft elongation and keratin synthesis; improves nutrient transport via vasodilation.\n* **Note**: Its caffeine content may also stimulate dermal papilla cell proliferation.\n\n# 🔬 5. Galla Rhois (Gallnut) Extract\n\n* **Scientific role**: High in gallotannins and polyphenols with antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-aging effects.\n* **Function**: Protects hair follicles and melanin-producing cells from UV-induced stress.\n\n# 🔬 6. Biota Orientalis Leaf Extract\n\n* **Scientific role**: Contains hinokitiol and essential oils with antibacterial and sebum-regulating properties.\n* **Impact**: Promotes a healthier scalp environment, improving follicular regeneration and pigment distribution.\n\n# 🔬 7. Castor Oil\n\n* **Scientific role**: Enhances follicular nourishment and moisture retention, supports regrowth of pigmented hair.\n* **Traditional use**: A cornerstone oil in Ayurvedic and folk medicine for scalp healing and density restoration.\n\n# 📈 Clinical Potential: What Results to Expect\n\nUnlike synthetic dyes that deliver instant masking, melanin-stimulating treatments require **biological remodeling** over time.\n\nTypical user observations include:\n\n* **Weeks 1–4**: Reduced dryness, scalp health improvements\n* **Weeks 4–8**: Gradual darkening of previously gray strands from root to tip\n* **Weeks 8–12**: Increased density, thickness, and visible repigmentation in newly growing hair\n\nThis treatment works best on **early-stage or partial gray hair**, where melanocytes are dormant (not destroyed).\n\n# 🛒 Where to Buy\n\nIf you're looking for a **non-toxic, scientifically informed, herbal alternative** to covering gray hair, our [**Mayraki Anti-Gray Hair Color Restoring Treatment**](https://hairmayraki.com/anti-grey-hair-color-restoring-treatment/) offers a research-backed pathway toward **melanin recovery and hair color restoration**.\n\nIt’s free from artificial dyes, parabens, SLS, and synthetic fragrance — safe for long-term use on sensitive scalps.\n\n👉 [Click here to shop the treatment](https://hairmayraki.com/anti-grey-hair-color-restoring-treatment/)",

It should be applied directly to the scalp area in the amount as advised by your doctor.  This medication must be used continuously to maintain hair growth. If your condition does not improve or worsens after using it for 4 to 6 months, consult your doctor\n\nAnasure solution is safe and suitable. The common side effects are itching or irritation of the scalp and unwanted hair growth in other places (not your scalp). It is a potassium channel opener vasodilatation action expands the blood vessels. Therefore, when it is applied to the scalp, it helps to increase the blood flow. This increased blood flow provides more nutrition and oxygen to the hair follicles, which prevents hair cell death and also enhances new hair growth used to treat your alopecia (hair loss).",

Paula's Choice has samples you can buy of both her 2% BHA liquid and 8% AHA gel. you wanna ease into it first by using the BHA one day then the AHA the other day, but some people can do BHA in the morning and AHA at night. make sure to use a sunscreen during the day as well bc the AHA makes your skin photosensitive. the AHA will slough off the layers of skin on the closed comedones and the BHA will penetrate them. If that doesnt work, you can go to the derm for a retinoid which will help the closed comedones and blackheads also.",

Studies in our laboratory indicate that transdermally administered oleanolic acid clears the malaria parasites from *P. berghei*\\-infected rats. Against this background, the current study investigated the effects of transdermally delivered OA on electrolytes and fluid handling, oxidative stress and selected hormones in P. berghei-infected male Sprague-Dawley rats. Renal function was monitored in groups of non-infected and malaria-infected rats following treatment with OA-pectin patch (34mg/kg). The study was divided into pre-treatment (day 0-7), treatment (day 8-12) and post-treatment (day13-21) periods. Animals treated with drug-free pectin and chloroquine (30mg/kg) acted as negative and positive controls respectively. Infected control animals exhibited reduced urinary sodium (Na+) and increased potassium (K+) output which was accompanied by hyperkalaemia. The treatment of infected animals with OA-pectin patch increased urinary Na+ output, with a concomitant increase in arginine vasopressin. Furthermore, urinary and plasma K+ concentrations were restored back to normalcy by day 12 of the study. OA treatment also reduced plasma creatinine concentrations and increased glomerular filtration rate in infected animals. Compared with infected control, OA patch-treated infected animals exhibited significantly reduced malondialdehyde and increased activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in renal tissues. The current study demonstrates that transdermally delivered OA ameliorates kidney function in malaria-infected animals. These findings are of clinical importance since acute renal failure is a frequent and serious complication associated with P. falciparum infection in non-immune patients.\n\n  \n\n**For Read More** [Fulltext](https://juniperpublishers.com/jetr/JETR.MS.ID.555565.php) **click on:** [**https://juniperpublishers.com/jetr/JETR.MS.ID.555565.php**](https://juniperpublishers.com/jetr/JETR.MS.ID.555565.php)\n\n**For More articles in** [Endocrinology and Thyroid Research](https://juniperpublishers.com/jetr/index.php) **Please click on:** [**https://juniperpublishers.com/jetr/index.php**](https://juniperpublishers.com/jetr/index.php)\n\n**For More** [Open Access Journals](https://juniperpublishers.com/) **in Juniper Publishers Please click on:** [**https://juniperpublishers.com/**](https://juniperpublishers.com/)\n\n&#x200B;",

    "body": " \n\nYour teeth are extremely strong but also very lively. They require proper nutrition much like your skin and muscles and other body parts. Along with avoiding meals that can result in cavities, choosing wholesome, nutritional foods is also crucial.\n\nEven though there is no substitute for regular brushing and flossing, eating the correct foods that are high in calcium and vitamins A, C, and D will help you maintain strong teeth.\n\n \n\nJapanese researchers counted the teeth and examined the diets of 56 people between the ages 74. The researchers discovered that individuals with the fewest teeth also consumed the fewest veggies, fish, and shellfish.\n\nWhile consuming wholesome foods, you should avoid sweet, sticky snacks because they encourage the growth of cavity-causing germs.\n\nEating to maintain healthy teeth Calcium is a crucial element that your teeth also require, especially in your early years. According to William Kuttler, DDS, a dentist in private practice in Dubuque, Iowa, \"Calcium-rich diets are really important.\" Teeth won't develop without calcium, he says. Calcium strengthens the bone that supports the teeth in adults to stop them from becoming loose over time.\n\n \n\nYou may provide your teeth the best possible protection by including more dairy items in your diet. For instance, 300 milligrammes of calcium, or around 30% of the daily value (DV) for this mineral, can be found in a glass of low-fat milk. There are 448 milligrammes and 488 milligrammes in eight ounces of plain yoghurt that is low in fat and fat free, respectively. Reduced-fat cheeses and several leafy green vegetables, such as turnip greens, bok choy, and curly endive, provide slightly smaller amounts.\n\nHowever, for strong, healthy teeth, you require more than simply calcium. Additionally, you require a range of vitamins, such as vitamins D, C, and A. According to scientists at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, a lack of vitamin D can result in bone loss and increased inflammation, which is a sign of gum disease. This means that vitamin D is crucial for maintaining healthy teeth. Drinking milk that has been fortified with vitamin D is the best approach to ensure that you get both calcium and vitamin D.\n\nEven worse are sticky meals. The cause is that these meals adhere to the teeth and enable bacteria to live in the mouth for an extended period of time. One item, meanwhile, that is notorious for being sticky may actually be excellent for your teeth. Oleanolic acid, a substance present in raisins, has been shown by University of Chicago researchers to inhibit the adhesion of plaque-producing bacteria to surfaces.\n\nThe best approach to handle sticky snacks is to brush your teeth right after eating them or drinking something sugary. Simply washing your mouth with water will assist to remove carbohydrates before bacteria can cause any harm, even if you are unable to brush.\n\n \n\n**What you eat, as much as how you eat, matters.**\n\nA dietary supplement called Steel Bite Pro can help with gum disease, tooth decay, rotting teeth, and other severe dental problems. say yes will help you",

Raisins are popular across the world and it is produced in many regions around the globe. Raisins could be used in any sort of cooking, baking, and brewing and can also be eaten raw.\n\nThere are several types of raisins and the types depend upon the kind of grapes used and in the sizes, it is produced.

Thus having raisins on a daily basis will help in preventing the formation of cancer in your body. And if you already have cancer in a progressing state, raisin will provide resistance to the further progression of cancer.\n* The 80’s study shows that **raisins can help comprehensively in preventing diabetes and heart- related problems**. Raisins are rich in heart-healthy electrolyte potassium. Only 100 grams of raisins provide 749 milligrams of potassium. This helps in maintaining heart rate and blood sugar levels by countering the sodium levels in the body.\n\n                         As a result helps in preventing stroke, CHD, and peripheral vascular diseases.

Raisins are considered to sugar-rich manufacturing candies that are the best healthy alternatives to eat in place of junks that prove to be hazardous to our body. Some of the health benefits are:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Helps in digestion**\\- daily intake of raisins can be a great help in keeping waste products off the system. This enhances the digestion of the food in our bodies. Raisins provide a laxative effect to the stomach that helps in curing constipation.\n* **Relief from Acidity**: Raisins have both potassium and magnesium contents in it. This helps in keeping the body free from acidity and it also maintains normal acidic levels of our system. As a result disease like kidney stones, arthritis and gout can be eradicated.\n* **Treats anemia**: raisins have vitamins like B complex and iron that make it suitable for preventing anemia. Some red blood cells are produced by the copper present in raisin.\n* **Prevents Cancer:** raisins have catechins that are polyphenolic antioxidants which helps in preventing the deadly disease.

Raisins have this incredible ability to increase the production of weight loss hormone leptin in our bodies. This makes us feel fuller even if we had a lesser amount of our usual intake.\n\n### ASAP Bars.\n\nASAP Bars get their dynamic taste from this natural sweetener. The inclusion of dry fruit in ASAP bars not only enhances the taste of it but also these bars have an increased amount of nutritional value. The mildly sweet taste of these bars is because of this dry fruit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1menk8xux3e41.jpg?width=590&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=104871e834e344daa78adf8b081ff9eca44b3985\n\nThese bars are exceptionally healthy as they are no additional chemical sugars.

    "body": "Hair fall and thinning are common concerns for both men and women. With countless products on the market promising miraculous results, hair growth serums have gained immense popularity. But the burning question remains — **do they actually work?** We consulted dermatologists and examined the science to uncover the truth. \n\nCerise Naturals intense growth hair serum stands out due to its scientific backing and targeted formula designed to address specific hair issues effectively. This article dives into the world of hair growth serums to see if they truly deliver on their promises, focusing on Cerise Naturals innovative approach.\n\n**What Are Hair Growth Serums?**\n\n[Hair growth serums](https://cerisenaturals.com/products/intense-growth-hair-serum) are topical formulations designed to stimulate hair follicles, improve scalp health, and encourage the growth of stronger, thicker hair. They usually contain a blend of active ingredients that target the hair and scalp follicles, aiming to stimulate hair growth at root.\n\nHair growth serums penetrate deeper to deliver nutrients and active compounds to the hair follicles directly, unlike shampoos and conditioners that primarily cleanse and condition the hair’s surface.\n\nHair growth serums often comes in a lightweight oils or liquid based formula that are easy to apply and are meant to be left on scalp to be absorbed fully.\n\n**Understanding the Ingredients: Plant Stem Cell Extracts, Redensyl, Procapil, and Aminexil**\n\nThe efficacy of hair growth serums hinges on their ingredients. Many serums contain a blend of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and botanical extracts known to support hair health. Key ingredients might include:\n\n**1.    Plant Stem Cell Extracts** – A molecule derived from a combination of 70 herbs and plants to increase the efficacy and stimulate hair growth. It increases hair volume, offering a natural approach to enhance hair density.\n\n**2.      Redensyl** \\- Redensyl is often referred to as a plant-based alternative to Minoxidil. It contains molecules like **DHQG (Dihydroquercetin-glucoside)** and **EGCG-glucoside**, which target hair follicle stem cells and fibroblasts.\n\n“Redensyl stimulates the hair follicle at the cellular level, promoting the anagen (growth) phase while reducing inflammation,” says Dr. Meenal Shah, a Mumbai-based dermatologist.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n* Increases hair density and thickness\n* Promotes faster hair growth\n* Reduces hair fall by reviving dormant follicles\n\n#                   3. Procapil\n\nProcapil is a patented blend of **biotinyl-GHK, apigenin, and oleanolic acid**. It tackles **DHT sensitivity**, a leading cause of hair thinning, especially in men.\n\n“Procapil strengthens the hair anchoring system and protects follicles from aging and hormonal damage,” explains Dr. Aditi Verma, Trichologist.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n* Prevents follicle miniaturization\n* Blocks DHT locally\n* Improves scalp microcirculation\n\n#                       4. Aminexil\n\nAminexil is a clinically-proven molecule derived from Minoxidil. Unlike Minoxidil, it is non-irritating and helps **prevent collagen hardening around hair follicles**, which can suffocate hair roots.\n\n“Aminexil is great for people with early hair fall or post-partum shedding. It enhances hair retention and works well with other actives,” says Dr. Rajat Kandhari, dermatologist and hair expert.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n* Prevents hair shaft stiffening\n* Supports hair bulb strength\n* Reduces hair fall in stress and hormonal cases\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pdwk07m70c0f1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=63dac2c649b6d805ab9bf97d7b1c98a52497f8eb\n\n**What Dermatologists Say: Do These Serums Work?**\n\nWhen used consistently, Intense Growth Hair Serum with Plant Stem Cell Extracts, Redensyl, Procapil, and Aminexil show **measurable improvement in hair density and reduced shedding within 60–90 days**.\n\n“These actives don’t just coat the hair — they work at the root level. They are especially effective in early to moderate stages of hair thinning,” says Dr. Deepali Bhardwaj, Senior Dermatologist.\n\nHowever, these serums are **not overnight solutions**. Results depend on factors like:\n\n* Hormonal balance\n* Diet and nutrition (iron, Vitamin D, B-complex)\n* Scalp health\n* Stress levels\n\n**How to Use These Intense Growth Hair Serum for Best Results**\n\n* **Apply once or twice daily** on a clean, dry scalp (preferably at night).\n* **Massage gently** to improve absorption and blood flow.\n* Do **not rinse off** — this is a leave-in treatment.\n* Be **consistent for at least 3–6 months**.\n* Pair with a healthy diet and scalp care routine.\n\n**Realistic Expectations: What to Expect and When**\n\n||\n||\n|**Timeline**|**What You May Notice**|\n|2–4 weeks|Reduced hair fall, less shedding|\n|6–8 weeks|Baby hair (vellus hair) growth in sparse areas|\n|3–6 months|Improved thickness and volume|\n|6+ months|Visible regrowth and better hair coverage|\n\n**Final Verdict: Yes, Intense Growth Hair Serum Works — With the Right Routine**\n\nIntense Growth Hair Serum containing Plant Stem Cell Extracts, **Redensyl, Procapil, and Aminexil** is some of the most advanced non-prescription options for managing hair thinning. This **don’t just address symptoms**, but also **target the biological causes** of hair loss.\n\n**Bottom line**: If you're looking for science-backed, non-greasy, and easy-to-use solutions, Intense growth hair serum with these ingredients is a smart choice — especially when started early and used consistently.\n\n",

That's why I'm most skeptical about this product, even though it's the cheapest and has the most ingredients – though that doesn't necessarily mean anything. But since all the other products in the shop, like dermarollers, etc., are outrageously overpriced, I would be surprised if this particular product was actually worth its price. On the other hand, the other manufacturers are probably making huge margins on their products as well, that's for sure.",
