I was basically forced to recently though, and was ready to put up a massive brawl if he tried to get me to change my diet which has been working well so far.\n\nBut - it turns out that he thought Keto was great!  He is a Paleo Dieter himself, and fully understood what I was trying to accomplish.  He even gave me a handout with a load of details as to why Keto and Paleo diets work with recommendations on what to do, and I got permission to post it here.  It is an OCR of his document, so please ignore any misspellings as I tried to catch them all.\n\n**Written By**\n\n**Dr. Daniel Egan M.D.**\n\n**[Website](http://alpinefamilymedicine.com/danbio.html)**\n\n\n\n**Optimal Metabolism**\n\nIf you have trouble maintaining a healthy weight, it’s very likely that you have a problem with how fat cells communicate with your brain Contrary to conventional wisdom, obesity is caused by inﬂammation and hormone mismatches, not by a lack of will-power, lack of exercise, or even calorie intake. Here’s how it really works:\n\nFat cells secrete a hormone called leptin. Leptin travels from fat cells and tells a part of the brain. the hypothalamus, how much fat you have. Under optimal circumstances, the hypothalamus is very responsive to leptin. When this is the case, the hypothalamus matches appetite and energy expenditure, resulting in easy weight control. Likely you know someone like this. They seem to eat as much as they want, but they always stay lean and ﬁt. This person is leptin sensitive. They have a fat thermostat that works.\n\nOn the other hand, in an obese person, the receptors for leptin are damaged, thus making the hypothalamus blind to leptin. Even though such a person might have a hundred pounds Of fat stored on their belly, energy to spare so to speak, the hypothalamus perceives that the body is actually starving. This hormonal “mismatch” drives excessive appetite, cravings, persistent fat storage, low sex hormone production, low thyroid secretion, muscle wasting, weight gain, Type 2 diabetes, and fatigue. Such a person is leptin resistant. Their fat thermostat is broken and all the hormones that govern metabolism are deranged. If your hormones are wrong, you can eat like a bird and still gain weight.\n\nSo this begs the question, what causes the body to become leptin resistant? Well, there are many reasons, but here are a few of the big ones:\n\n**THINGS ASSOCIATED WITH LEPTIN RECEPTOR DAMAGE:**\n\n* inflammation\n* high insulin levels\n* poor sleep and/or night shift work\n* low Vitamin D\n* low Omega-3 to Omega-6 ratio of fatty acids\n* high blood sugar\n* high triglycerides\n* elevated LDLp form of cholesterol\n* infections (viral, bacterial, ﬁmgal)\n* high fructose corn syrup\n* lectins and gluten from cereal grains\n* an injury or severe illness\n* high body fat percentage\n* low exercise or sedentary job\n* childbirth and/or multiple pregnancies\n* too much stress: physical, emotional, or mental\n* MSG, aspartame, NutraSweet, BPA, phenylalanine (common in processed foods)\n\nThe next question you might be asking yourself is whether it is possible to ﬁx the leptin receptors? Yes, it is, but it requires speciﬁc actions.\n\n**HOW DO YOU HEAL THE LEPTIN RECEPTOR?**\n\nThe most important leptin receptors are in the hypothalamus. This is an ancient part of the brain that controls hormones and circadian rhythms. It’s a part of the brain that requires sleep, low stress, low inﬂammation, proper nutrition, and in some cases, cold exposure to work well. Living your life in a way that maximizes hypothalamic function will ﬁx the “biological mismatches” that have fouled up your hormones and metabolism. **Achieving optimal health is all about correcting these mismatches and living as nature intended.**\n\nResetting your fat thermostat requires **5 LIFESTYLE CHANGES.**\n\n**1.  DEFEAT STRESS: Stress raises cortisol and turns sex hormone production off. It also makes your cells more resistant to insulin. High cortisol and high insulin keep your cells in “fat-storage” not “fat-burning” mode.**\n\n* Decide in your mind that you will be in charge of your health and your life.\n* Resolve any high stress conflicts.\n* Don’t procrastinate.\n* Simplify your life.\n* Take 10 slow, deep breathes every hour. This shuts off the sympathetic (panic) nervous system.\n* Plan out your meals in advance, so you’re not stressing or scrambling, and eating poor quality food.\n* Exercises like yoga, calm walks with a loved-one, and being outdoors help, too.\n\n**2.  EAT FOR YOUR GENES: The USDA food pyramid is not helping the nation’s obesity problem. The Standard American Diet is a complete failure. Our bodies crave nutrient dense food that satisﬁes our physiologic needs 100%, not processed junk and gruel.**\n\n* Eat a “whole food” or “Paleo” style diet. More on diet is explained below.\n* Don’t eat any processed, canned, or packaged foods.\n* Don’t eat anything with artificial sweeteners. Stevia might be the only exception.\n* Eat a **BIG** breakfast with 30-50 grams of protein within an hour of waking up. Eat until you’re quite full. Don’t use protein powder (whey) for this. It causes an insulin and sugar spike.\n* Eat 3 meals a day. Avoid snacking. Breakfast is big, lunch a bit smaller, dinner a bit smaller. If you eat a small, low-carb dinner, your liver will burm fat all night long. Eventually you might only need 2 meals a day.\n* Eating frequently, especially loads of carbohydrate, keeps insulin “on”. This means you’ll store fat instead of burning it.\n* Limit your carbohydrates to around 50-150 grams a day. Eat fewer carbs in the winter, more in the summer.\n* Eat dinner 4-5 hours prior to bedtime.\n\n**3.  HACK YOUR SLEEP: Leptin enters the hypothalamus only in the deep stages of sleep. Your brain won’t know how to burn fat without it. We also repair our bodies (autophagy) during sleep. When we don’t repair damage, we a more likely to get cancer. Artiﬁcial light, especially after sunset, turns up cortisol (stress hormone that causes fat storage) and turns off sex hormone production.**\n\n* Expose your eyes to natural sunlight every day, especially in the morning.\n* Dim the lights in your entire house after dinner.\n* Keep your bedroom cool and dark.\n* Don’t read in bed.\n* Wear yellow or amber tinted glasses after dimmer time. Yellow lenses block blue wavelength light. Low light levels prepare the brain for sleep.\n* No bright lights, T.V., or computer within 90 minutes of bedtime.\n* Aim for 8-10 hours of sleep.\n* Many people will start to lose weight when they turn off the TV, computer, and iPad when the sun sets.\n\n**4.  HEAL YOUR GUT: The total surface area of the gut lining is nearly two football ﬁelds. Although it is mostly hidden from us, the gut is the main way our body interacts with the outside world. We have 100 times more bacteria in our gut than we have cells in our entire body. The gut bacteria interact with our immune system in a major way. Inﬂammation that damages leptin receptors and triggers auto-immune diseases usually starts in the gut. Healing your gut will promote the maximum absorption of vitamins and minerals and keep “poop” out of your bloodstream. This will calm down inﬂammation and allow the leptin system to heal and function normally. You will also reduce your risk of autoimmune diseases.**\n\n* Avoid cereal grains, seed oils, excessive sugar and especially high fructose com syrup, soy products, beans, excessive lactose and casein. See more on diet below.\n* Eat some food with fermentable ﬁbers (starches like sweet potato, yam, tapioca, etc.).\n* Eat fermented foods like keﬁr, Greek yogurt, sauerkraut, kimchi AND/OR take a high-quality, multi-species pro-biotic tablet.\n* Coconut oil is a super food for damaged intestines, also bone broths.\n* Avoid NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) or PPIs (Prilosec, Nexium) if possible.\n* Older patients might need HCL acid supplements.\n\n**5.  TRY SOME COLD THERAPY: Cold exposure turns on growth hormone and GNRH, the hormone that stimulates the sex hormones. These hormones build muscle and bone. Also, the leptin receptors really turn on in the cold. Cold tells your body to turn fat into heat by converting white adipose tissue (WAT) to brown adipose tissue (BAT) and muscle. We are warm-blooded mammals and as such, much of our calorie expenditure every day is related to heat production. You can easily burn as many calories generating body heat as running on a treadmill, for example. Cold exposure also sets the body up for excellent sleep.**\n\n* Drink ice-cold water.\n* Apply ice packs to your belly for 20-30 minutes a day (a “Colpac” brand oversized ice pack works Well and can be ordered on Amazon)\n* Exercise in colder temperatures.\n* Swim in cold water.\n* Take some cold showers.\n* Work up to taking cold-water baths\n\n\n**A BIT MORE ON DIET**\n\nThe Standard American Diet (S.A.D) is well. ..SAD. Americans suffer from more chronic health problems than any other culture. Why? We eat low-vitamin-content food that our bodies aren't designed to use in an optimal way and that often leaves us feeling unsatisﬁed and hungry.\n\nMuch modern “food” messes up digestion, leads to obesity, and triggers or exacerbates many auto-immune diseases.\n\nYou are what you eat after all, right?\n\nWhy not eat what the human body is designed to consume‘? Eat real food! (Just in case you were\nwondering, a Twinkie is not real food.)\n\nHere’s what I avoid eating: **1) sugar, 2) grains, and 3) vegetable oils.** Along with the “big 3” listed above, I don’t eat many legumes and not much milk.\n\nThe above mentioned foods are toxic to some degree for most people. Although these foods don’t typically make us acutely ill, we are more likely to develop “chronic” problems if we eat them for long enough: obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, etc. I call such problems **diseases of civilization** because they rarely existed prior to the modem diet or among present-day indigenous cultures that eat natural foods. I ﬁnd that quite interesting.\n\nIf you avoid “the big 3” mentioned above, you are Lmlikely to be obese or get Type 2 diabetes, and you’ll also reduce your risk of cancer, auto-immune disease, and heart disease. Here’s a short explanation why I don’t eat these foods.\n\n* **Sugar** causes insulin spikes and damages the leptin receptors in the brain that control appetite. Insulin is a hormone that keeps your blood sugar from going too high after you eat by storing that sugar as fat. Insulin spikes are bad because they trigger excessive appetite and eventually, obesity. Insulin spikes also burn out the pancreas, which leads to Type 2 diabetes. Sugar in the diet also causes “glycation”, an oxidative process that damages tissues, especially arteries, thus increasing the risk of heart attacks. Glycation also damages the “appetite control” leptin receptors in the hypothalamus. Having damaged leptin receptors puts your metabolism into “starvation mode”, even if you have too much fat already. Not good. Sugar makes you fat, especially around the waist, and the bigger your belly, the more likely you are to get diabetes or heart problems.\n* **Grains** trigger a hyperactive immune response in many people and damage the protective lining of the gut. This makes the gut “leaky” which allows all sorts of bad things to enter the circulation that shouldn’t — like poop! When the immune system has to deal with more than it can handle, it can inadvertently attack “innocent bystanders” like thyroid tissue, brain tissue, skin tissue, lung tissue, etc. This haphazard stimulation of the immune system can exacerbate thyroid problems, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, eczema and many others. Many of these problems start with a “leaky gut” issue. Another problem with grains, it that they spike insulin levels just as much as pure sugar does. They also contain “phytates” that interfere with calcium, copper, magnesium, iron, and zinc absorption. Lastly, practically all grain these days is genetically modiﬁed, which makes them a questionable food source, at best. So with grains, you give yourself a triple whammy: hyperactive insulin, a hyperactive immune system, and lousy mineral absorption. Can the human organism survive on a grain based diet? Yes, of course it can, but we want the very best fuel for our bodies, not gruel.\n* Just like grains, **vegetable oils and margarine** have chemical structures that ﬁre up the immune system in an indiscriminate fashion. Vegetable oils such as those derived from sunﬂower, safﬂower, canola, com, and soybeans contain an excessive amount of omega-6 fatty acids relative to omega-3 fatty acids. If you eat too much omega-6, your body over-produces inﬂammatory proteins that can lead to health problems and pain. Additionally, most soy and com these days is also genetically modiﬁed.\n\nCan we survive on a diet based on sugar, grain, and vegetable oil? Yes, of course, but this is not optimal. When you are trying to restore your health, survival foods are not going to cut it. You need to eat foods that satisfy the dictates of our evolutionary heritage to have optimal health.\n\nSo, what’s good to eat?\n\n* Pretty much all **veggies** in any quantity you like. Get all the colors: green, yellow, red, purple, orange, and white, but go easy on the starchy potatoes if you want to lose weight. It’s best to eat these in spring, summer and fall, a bit less in winter. Organic is better if you can afford it. Growing your own is the very best, in my opinion.\n* **Fruit**: 2-3 pieces of fruit a day is okay, but eat less if you have diabetes, need to lose some weight, or have irritable bowels. Our hormones and metabolism are set up to eat fruit when the days are long and getting cooler —late summer and autumn. That’s the best time to eat them.\n* **Fish**, including the skin if you like it. Salmon is a super-food. So are sardines. Eat ﬁsh often. If you don’t like ﬁsh, take a ﬁsh oil, cod liver oil, or krill oil supplements to get your Omega-3 fatty acids. The longest lived people in the world all eat **seafood: shrimp, scallops, lobster, clams, mussels**, etc. **I challenge all my patients to eat some ﬁsh or seafood every day.**\n* **Seaweed** is a super-food and can be a daily addition to your diet. If you decide to do a very low-carb, ketogenic type diet, you need the iodine in seafood to keep your thyroid going. Kelp tablets can help get the iodine you need on days you don’t eat seafood.\n* Grass-fed or “free-range” meat: **beef, lamb, pork, turkey, chicken,** etc. **Wild game** is great, too. Grass-fed meat and wild game has higher Omega-3s and many other nutrients than does “feed-lot” produced meat. Find a local rancher if you can. Store bought meat is not as good, but it’s okay. KSL classiﬁeds can be a good resource for this.\n* **Butter, ghee, or cream** from pasture-fed cows. Milk is loaded with carbs, so drink water instead. I restrict dairy products in some patients, but for starters, it’s probably okay.\n* **Eggs**, especially from “free-range” chickens that can eat insects, worms, and grass.\n* **Organ meats like liver and heart**, especially if you’re one of 25% of the population that doesn’t convert beta-carotene to real vitamin A. Butchers can mix these into hamburger for you if you don’t like it plain. Menstruating women can really get a boost from these iron-rich super-foods. Eat less of these if you have high ferritin or iron levels.\n* **Bone broths**. Critical if you have arthritis, cartilage damage, herniated discs, or osteoporosis.\n* **Ghee, lard, butter, tallow, or coconut oil** are great for cooking.\n* **Macadamia nut oil, avocado oil, and olive oil** are useful for dressings.\n* Small amounts of nuts are good for you. Macadamias are the lowest in Omega-6. Don’t go nuts on nuts, however. They are an accessory food.\n* Eat foods with “healthy” bacteria: **kefir, Greek yogurt, homemade sauerkraut,** etc.\n* **Dark chocolate**, 65% and up is best.\n* Drink plenty of **ice-cold water**. Green tea is okay. Coffee if you like. Avoid other beverages.\n* **Himalayan Pink Salt**. This salt has dozens of trace minerals and is vastly superior to table salt. It does not have iodine, however, but if you’re eating plenty of seafood and seaweed, you’ll be getting all the iodine you need. \n* **Sweet potatoes** are a safe, starchy food. If you’re athletic and need to “carb-load” this is the best food to do it with.\n* Do not eat packaged and processed foods. Avoid soda, additives and preservatives. If it has a long shelf life, you should not put it in your body.\n\nBeans and other legumes are okay when sprouted or cooked for a long-time, but these foods have proteins that can damage the gut lining in some people, just like the grains do, so I can’t give them a total green light. They might be okay in small amounts. Personally, I’ve stopped eating them.\n\nIf you want to lose weight, keep your daily carbohydrate intake at around 50 -100 grams and get the rest of your calories for the day from fat and protein. If there is a secret to weight loss, this is it. Use the website Fitday to calculate your carbohydrate intake.\n\nMost people will be less hungry on this diet and won’t need to cotmt calories. Just eat until you feel satisﬁed, but not “stuffed.”\n\nHere’s a site with plenty of recipes: [http://nomnompaleo.com/recipeindex](http://nomnompaleo.com/recipeindex), but meals can be very simple: some meat or seafood, an egg or two, some veggies, and a slice of fruit. Done.\n\nRead Mark Sisson. His website also has a lot of great information: [www.marksdailyapple.com](http://www.marksdailyapple.com).\n\n[http://perfecthealthdiet.com](http://perfecthealthdiet.com) is another resource I like.\n\n**HOW WILL YOU KNOW YOUR “FAT THERMOSTAT” IS WORKING AGAIN?**\n\n* Hunger and cravings greatly diminish\n* Sleeping like a rock\n* Feeling refreshed in the morning\n* Less muscle soreness\n* Mental calmness\n* Steady weight loss\n* Increased libido\n* Softer skin and stronger nails\n* Improved mental ability\n* Fewer headaches\n* Dreaming, especially about moving your body (dancing, exercising, exploring, etc.)\n* More energy\n* Firmer gums, smoother teeth\n\n**WHAT ABOUT EXERCISE?**\n\nIt’s important to wait until you have some clear signs of leptin sensitivity prior to working out hard. If you push it too soon, you can damage your stem cells and push cortisol levels up before your metabolic and hormonal systems are ready. Once you have 5-6 signs of leptin sensitivity (from the above list), you can start doing more exercise: walking, lifting weights, calisthenics, and eventually sprinting. You don’t ever have to jog again! (If you don’t want to, that is.) Exercise outdoors whenever possible. Long-distance running and cycling are not the best exercise for losing weight. Weight training, sprinting, and body—weight exercises like push-ups and squats are better. If you do these types of exercises at a high intensity level, your heart and lungs will get plenty of a workout. Work into exercise slowly. For many people, it’s a good idea to get a treadmill test prior to working out to make sure your heart is good to go for it.\n\n**WHAT PROBLEMS MIGHT ARISE WITH A BIG DIET CHANGE?**\n\n* Moodiness — This can be mitigated with a 5-HTP supplement, B complex vitamins, and selenium. Also, fat is your friend with this one. Eat more coconut oil, olive oil, cream, butter, fatty ﬁsh like salmon, or bacon. Eating a high tryptophan food, like turkey, along with a little bolus of carbs, like sweet potatoes, can boost serotonin levels pretty quickly, too. \n* Headache, muscle weakness, and dizziness. These will go away as your body builds up its fat buming machinery, usually within a week.\n* Smelly urine — this is from ketones in the urine and it generally a sign that you’re eating enough protein and the right amount of carbs. Don’t be alarmed.\n* Constipation — If this happens, eat more vegetables. They are full of soluble ﬁber and have less of a “glycemic-load” than fruit or prunes. Ground ﬂax seeds and magnesium work well, too.\n* Some people, especially women, do better with a slow decrease in the amount of carbs. You can follow higher carbohydrate version of the Pale diet without eating gluten grains or sugars, just eat sweet potatoes, yams, bananas, or rice instead. As your fat burning machinery kicks in, you’ll be able to decrease carbs to 50 -150 grams/day eventually without feeling irritable.\n* Plateaus: These are to be expected. Weight loss and metabolic optimization often progress in ﬁts and starts. You are rebuilding your metabolism and this takes time. If you plateau at a certain Weight for more than a month, there’s probably a hormone problem to address. See me and we’ll ﬁgure it out with some labs and a review of your diet, sleep, and exercise pattems.\n\n\nIn general, I’m not a big fan of supplements, but most people with broken down metabolism and hormone problems have nutritional deﬁciencies that can be helped in the short term by medications or supplements. Once you are at a healthy weight and have eaten well for 6-12 months, they typically are not necessary.\n\nFor everyone:\n\n\n* A high quality **multivitamin** helps because if you’re not eating a good diet, it’s very likely you have vitamin and mineral deﬁciencies. It’s expensive to test for everything, so this is just a low-risk, low cost way to get up to normal.\n* **Omega-3 fatty acids** via ﬁsh oil or krill oil help restore the balance of Omega-3 to Omega-6 fatty acids. These two fatty acids use the same enzyme pathway, so if you have too much of one, it outcompetes the other. Essentially all Americans are overloaded with Omega-6 from packaged foods, margarine, and vegetable oil. Too much Omega-6 causes persistent inﬂammation that damages the leptin receptors (and everything else for that matter.) I can take years of eating well to get to the proper balance. If you eat ﬁsh daily you probably don’t need a supplement. If you don’t eat much ﬁsh, take l-3 tablets a day.\n* **Vitamin D** is low in most of my patients, so get it tested. Some people need high dosages to get to optimal ranges. I test my level a few times a year. Taking 2000 IU daily is okay to start, but many people need more. A good level is between 50-100.\n* **Magnesium** is a required co-factor to make A/TP, which powers all of your cells. Magnesium competes for absorption with Vitamin D, so spacing these two supplements by 12 hours helps. Most people should take 400-800mg daily in the form of magnesium glycinate, threonate, or malate. Magnesium oxide is more readily available in stores, but doesn’t work quite as well.\n\nFor special circmnstances:\n\n* **5-HTP** helps if you get moody while adjusting to a new diet. This is a serotonin precursor.\n* **PQQ** (pyrroloquinoline quinone) helps rebuild muscle mitochondria.\n* **Vitamin K2** is a co-factor for calcium-binding enzymes. This is good for people with osteoporosis, along with Vitamin D. Naturally it occurs in fermented foods. Post- menopausal women need this as much as calcium and vitamin D.\n* **Ubiquinol** (the more costly form of Co-enzyme Q10) helps rebuild mitochondria in the muscles. This can really help when you’re ready to start more vigorous exercise.\n* **DHEA** can help if you have a sex hormone deﬁciency or pregnenolone steal syndrome. It also helps with sleep. Men can take 50 -100mg. Women can start around 25mg. Repeat testing is essential with this one.\n\nIf you d like extra reading material, I can give you a bibliography that cites key research studies and books that have more information on these topics.

I think one of the goals of this document is to look at it a bit differently than we have in the past.\n\n[Leptin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin) is fairly new in our understanding of health.  It was discovered in 1994!  Just a couple of weeks ago, the news was all over a new study showing the effect of fructose has on the body and its inhibition of leptin receptors (http://www.ucsf.edu/news/2013/01/13393/sugar-fights-still-simmer-new-brain-study-finds-fructose-might-stimulate-appetite)  Please read the UCSF article!!\n\nThis document is making the case, that calorie counting when you have damaged leptin receptors does not work like it should.  After you have repaired those receptors and stop taking in things that damage them (things you find in modern diet), then calories are now doing what they should be.  You will make better decisions (making it easier to calorie count) because you are not as hungry, and your brain isn't confused as to how much storage it has.\n\nSo - both sides are correct.  Calorie counting should not be discounted, and strict calorie counting does not work for everyone.\n\nWe are all individuals, and I truly hope that generalizations in diet one day will stop.",

    "body": "Edit: title should be fatty alcohols not fatty acids but autocorrect thinks for me and sees me type acids a lot so naturally I must’ve meant acids. SIGH. \n\n**WARNING: LONG BUT I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE IT WORTH.**\n\nHey all!\n\nSoooo, years ago, I was a big advocate for the [idea that some people cannot use fatty alcohols](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1y3ql7/simple_tip_for_those_of_us_who_cant_use_fatty/). This was due to my experiences with CeraVe Cream, CeraVe Lotion, Cetaphil Cream, and Cetaphil Lotion, primarily. More, I was using Ziana (.025% tretinoin + clindamycin), which I have a strong suspicion in retrospect was the cause of a form of folliculitis for me (perhaps chemical folliculitis -- there are several types of folliculitis but in this case, acne that is not \"acne,\" but rather born of continuous irritation of the hair follicles). Of course, like *everyone* going through acne, I blamed every skin product I was using except the prescription active that was *designed* to make my acne better. After all, a doctor gave it to me, and a doctor wouldn't give me something that would make me \"sicker.\" \n\nUnfortunately, it turns out that by the time I started to figure this out, it was all way too late. To this day, I have light pitted scarring in places from an 8 month moderate-to-severe zit explosion on my face that never ceased. It has taught me a lot and pressed me to learn a lot about how skin *actually* functions. I was told the entire time I was breaking out that it was just \"purging,\" only to realize what a misnomer \"purging\" kind of is -- implying the skin is holding onto infections waiting to churn out of it's layers rather than comedones -- open or closed -- that are visible, as well as microcomedones that are the beginning of an acne spot but invisible to the naked eye. At the time, purging to me implied that there were acne spots in the deeper layers of my skin waiting to come out. \n\nSo in the process of me flailing, I felt like this class of ingredients that are otherwise harmless were my bane: fatty alcohols. These are stearyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, and cetyl alcohol. After all, they turned up in *everything* that was breaking me out, including the cleansers, so surely it had to be them, right? \n\nFor example, at one point, I was using Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser + CeraVe Cream. What do these products have in common?\n\n**Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser**\n&amp;gt; Water, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, **Stearyl Alcohol**, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben.\n\n**CeraVe Cream**\n&amp;gt;Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20 And **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauryl Lactylate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n\n---\n\nSo being the ingredient hound I am, I connected the dots to \"must be fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives.\" After all, everything else I used had had these ingredients too.\n\n**CeraVe Lotion**\n&amp;gt; Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceteareth-20 and** Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\n**Cetaphil Cream**\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Petrolatum, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, PEG-30 Stearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Propylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n**Cetaphil Lotion** *note - I believe this used to have macadamia nut oil in it when I used it and has since been reformulated. \n\n&amp;gt; Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ceteareth-20, **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Dimethicone, Sodium Levulinate, Sodium Anisate,Caprylyl Glycol, Benzyl Alcohol, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer\n\nHappy, I thought, \"This must be it! I solved it!\" So I cut out fatty alcohol products (which, as I am sure many of you know, is a *massive* pain in the ass) and [tried to facilitate others in doing the same](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ufvym/megalisting_products_without_cetylcetearylstearyl/). In fact, I feel like I was the primary champion of \"it might be fatty alcohols!\" back when this sub was only 25k people, and being as we were all learning from eachother and trusted eachother, many people trusted me in that assumption. After all, I had the proof (supposedly) to back it up.\n\nSo I used the lightest products, such as EltaMD PM (which is a wonderful product, don't get me wrong!). Unfortunately, my skin was parched *all of the time.* It was just sick. It kept breaking out for years after, bottle after bottle of EltaMD PM. Life happened, I was removed from the mod group for inactivity, and I just kept on with it - disappearing from this sub for a long-ass time.\n\nAnd then I started thinking... *what did I use before my skin started down this road?*\n\nBefore I knew jack-all about skin, I used Olay pretty religiously. Olay Regenerist, in the pot, with the fragrance. Yep. This stuff:\n\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Isohexadecane, Niacinamide, Isopropyl Isostearate, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Nylon-12, Dimethicone, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Sodium Peg-7 Olive Oil Carboxylate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ceratonia Siliqua (Carob) Fruit Extract, ** Stearyl Alcohol**, Polyethylene, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Dimethiconol, Polyacrylamide, Fragrance, Peg-100 Stearate, Propylparaben, Cetearyl Glucoside, **Cetearyl Alcohol,** C13-14 Isoparaffin, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, C12-13 Pareth-3, Laureth-7, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica.\n\n*\"[Wait a fucking minute](https://media.giphy.com/media/iAYupOdWXQy5a4nVGk/giphy.gif),\"* she thought. \"That shit has cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol and coconut derivatives all the shit I am avoiding. How the fuck did my face not explode then?\"\n\nSo I did something insane: I tried a cream with fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives that was being recommended on this sub at the time (lol). Some of you may recognize this:\n\n**Cheryl Lee MD Ceramide+**\n&amp;gt;Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Coconut), Petrolatum, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Polyglyceryl -10 Pentastearate, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Isostearyl Isostearate, Cetyl Alcohol, 1,3 Propanediol (from Corn), C10-30 Cholesterol/Lanosterol Esters, Ceramide 3, Phytosphingosine, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Niacinamide, Glycyrrhetinic Acid (Licorice Root), 1,2 -Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Gluconolactone.\n\nAnd you want to know something?\n\n90% of my acne healed in a week. 90% of the acne that had been causing me scars and *ruining my fucking life for years* healed in a fucking **week**. I looked back at all the ingredients for all the products that I had avoided and all the ones I had just been able to use fine as a teenager and by fucking god, what did I miss? **Ceteareth-fucking-20** (sans the cleansers -- I still don't know why my skin hated Cetaphil Gentle, but it turns out that it has broken out with every creamy, non-sudsy cleanser ever, so I've resigned myself to using gentle SLES cleansers for life).\n\nI felt like such a massive asshole. \n\nSo that brings me to now, when I decided on a train on a vacation in NYC to start a skin blog. I had spent those years researching my ass off about skin not to even see what a massive fuckup I had made. I had been able to help my BF bring his eczema 80% into control with bleach bath washes and solve my mom's chronically dry skin and my friend's weird case of eczema on his ring finger, but not my own skin. \n\nI came back to this sub after ~5 fucking years (4 of them AFK) and I still see a lot of people avoiding *all fatty alcohols*. I'm making this post to tell you that it might not be all fatty alcohols. It may be cet-20, like me, or it may be those fatty alcohols in combination with other ingredients (combinations of some ingredients can change molecular sizes, some manufacturers use different sources or molecular sized products, like larger or smaller hyaluronic acid, for example). There's so much complexity with skincare, skin, and ingredients that it usually isn't *one whole class of ingredients*. In short: **your mileage may vary**. This is why spot testing is important, one product isn't for everyone, and while ingredient labels are important for weeding out culprits, you also need to do a bit of research on how ingredients work with others to change how they interact on the skin. \n\nSince then, I've spot tested many of the products I flat-out ruled out and 1. it turns out everything with cet-20 does explode my face, 2. it turns out macadamia nut oil also explodes my face (in the cet lotion), and 3. turns out I can use 50% of the things I thought I couldn't (like jojoba oil!).\n\nI'm so happy that many of you have found this sub educational, but **please** consider what you've used in the past (skincare for face, makeup, EVERYTHING) and don't neglect those products when cross-identifying culprits. It changed my life and it might change yours.\n\nSome takeaways, with bullet points because I love bullet points:\n\n* Don't rule out entire classes of ingredients. Skin is super individual and it may be one stupid ingredient.\n* Don't take all of your skincare advice from the Internet, and if you do, try to diversify. Reddit, acne.org, MakeupAlley, medical journals -- get in there and become your own advocate.\n* Sometimes, skin is just an asshole and you won't be able to figure out what it hates. Example: My skin has issues with CeraVe healing ointment and foaming wash, despite them lacking cet-20. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n* Sometimes, what is considered \"good\" or \"best\" for skin isn't good or best for your skin. Example for me: creamy cleansers. They're definitely recommended *everywhere* for *every* skin condition, esp rosacea (which I have), but my skin fucking loathes them all. No idea why, and that's okay.\n* Just because an ingredient is \"good\" for skin doesn't mean it is good for your skin. Example: Me and high % niacinamide = zits. Me and low % niacinamide = k.\n* Just because it's a prescription doesn't mean it can't fuck you up, fam. I thought prescription = good, no problems here, won't cause issues. I have literal scars to prove me wrong. Instead of assuming all is well, **TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR IF SHIT IS UP AND IF YOUR DOCTOR IS LIKE HEY SHIT IS FINE BUT YOU STILL THINK SHIT IS FUCKED, GO TO ANOTHER DOCTOR**. I wish I had done this. Instead, my doc kept urging me to use it every single night. Went to a new doc and he was like, \"Oh no, your skin is very sensitive, that is wayyyy too harsh.\" Listen to your gut.\n* Almost alll skin rules are more like guidelines (except the baking soda, lemon juice, harsh harsh scrubs stuff - that's all still true since they can all throw your skin very out of whack). Example: I do better with light physical exfoliation once a week than AHA any day.\n\nThanks, and I'm sorry for being such a massive, incorrect asshole. I'm doing my best to correct my errors now (and hopefully go to esthetics school though BF is pushing me to do dermatology).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",

There needs to be someone on the medical side who can vouch for us not being complete loons about our skin. \n\nYes I have to agree with the sentiment of your post.... over the last few years my skin has been freaking out over every little thing. Too hot, too cold, aha, bha, B3, HA, phenoxyethanol the list goes on. \n\nFor 7months I used Tretinoin 0.025% and built up slowly (I thought), the purge happened. Traumatic. Then just unhappy skin.... but it is gold standard for my issues right? My face said no. \n\nAfter becoming ill last year, severely for 6+ months, all skincare and Tret use went down the drain. Just SS once a day, used as moisturiser. Rarely even washed my face in the evening I was too exhausted. \n\nWhat this did, apart from giving me Cc's and what have you. Was a chance for my skin to repair my moisture barrier on my face. Since medication has helped with the symptoms of my illness,  I have been able to use 1 product in my routine with phenoxyethanol as the main preservative, without it giving me painful pustles and nodules everywhere I experienced before. \n\nI have realised that the rash of whiteheads where ever I use a product with HA in and determined was the HA also happens with high levels of BG. So now planning to test a large molecular weight HA serum to see if I have the same issue without the BG. PG is fine... Propanidol is great. \n\nB3 🤔 causes flushing in my skin. And I'm not really interested in trying again.... \n\nBHA, again let me try again at some point. But method of application might be the issue here. \n\nSo vitamin c seemed out of the lexicon for my skin. I now have a silicone based C vit lined up to trial. \n\nFragerance/ essential oils can still mess me up doh. \n\nMoral of this story for me? Concentrate on keeping healthy skin barrier. The rest comes after.... so cleanse (favourite step), treat (calming, hydrating, emollient and then the acne/PIH target), protect. This approach has been working for me so far.",

Think sleeping packs and thick creams.  Petrolatum (Vaseline) is the gold standard, but a good rule of thumb is to go as heavy and occlusive as your skin can handle without clogging pores. \n\n* Many facial oils are not occlusives. Read more about oils and occlusion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3v6yb8/psa_for_your_winter_dryness_most_oils_arent/)\n\n* What occlusive you eventually choose is largely individualized. Some rely on petrolatum-based balms, for others this results in bad breakouts. As always, patch test and add only one new product at a time. \n\n* What works for your skin can rapidly shift depending on climate, season, and region. Pay attention to signs of how your skin is responding to these various factors so you can adjust your routine accordingly. Be ready to change things up\n\n* You might be here because you’ve over exfoliated. You can generally tell this because 1) you just upped your acids, and 2) your skin is newly very sensitive to even mild products. You can read more here on [how to tell if you’ve damaged your moisture barrier.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/33xhax/what_are_the_signs_to_look_out_for_for/) Learn your lesson and when you restart, GO SLOWLY. Many people with lots of acids in their routine got there after sloooowly ramping up and allowing their skin to adjust. And consider [joining a support group ;)]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3tac9m/can_we_have_a_support_group_for_overexfoliators/)\n\n* If your dry skin is new and likely the result of new or increased actives in your routine (especially rein-A and other retinols, BHA, andor AHA) BACK OFF THE ACTIVES until your moisture barrier heals. DO NOT TRY TO “POWER THROUGH.” Scale back on your routine to the bare essentials, focusing on mild products, hydration, and occlusive creams. \n\n* Consider your cleanser. Tightness, dryness, and sensitivity that seems to be resistant to all the layers of hydration and creams may be the result of a cleanser your skin hates. Many with dry skin recommended avoiding foaming cleansers and using a cleansing milk as their second cleanser. Also consider cutting back to once-a-day cleansing, or simply rinsing your face with water. \n\n* Another recommendation was to save washing the face for evening\n\n* Consider eliminating anything that foams. \n\n* Please consider seeing a dermatologist if you can. Topical steroids may be something to consider if your skin is really suffering. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSources:\n\n[Help with Dry Skin and Double Cleansing]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4ca5e2/help_with_dry_skin_and_double_cleansing/)\n\n[Looking for a Gentle, low pH Second Cleanser for Dry Skin!]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4alfwn/looking_for_a_gentle_low_ph_second_cleanser_for/)\n\n[Cure for dry skin for retin a user- Vaseline]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/42zbt5/cure_for_dry_skin_for_retin_a_user_vaseline/)\n\n[Best toner and essence for normal-dry skin?]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/44bnvp/best_toner_and_essence_for_normaldry_skin/)\n\n\n[Looking for a moisturizing mist for winter and dry skin?]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/47ksng/looking_for_a_moisturizing_mist_for_winter_and/)\n\n[Dry skin product recommendations]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3e9yik/dry_skin_product_recommendations/)\n\n[What cushions do you recommend for my dry skin?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/45lue2/what_cushions_do_you_recommend_for_my_dry_skin/)\n\n[Sheet mask recommendation dry skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/38ekvx/sheet_mask_recommendation_dry_skin/)\n\n[Warning: Unpleasant Acne Pictures.

It's also low-ph! I use this as my second cleanser after an oil cleanser. DHC Cleansing Oil works really well. They don't dry me out like a lot of cleansers do.\n\nCleansing is the hardest part to get right for me. But I think the above combo really works, so I'm afraid to change it up much :)\n\nI am absolutely in love with the COSRX Snail Mucin Essence. Also, the Rice overnight pack is actually really good. I've not tried the Honey Ceramide one yet, but I'm loving the Rice pack.\n\nI am not sure how overlapping Dry/Sensitive/OverExfoliation are, because I have dry skin and I find that it's only sensitive when my skin is dehydrated/broken barrier. But I find that my dry skin is mostly happy with anything that moisturises it.",

        "body": "Not AB, but Earth Science has a cream cleanser that I believe is fatty alcohol free and is around pH 5.5. I also plan to try out some non-foaming cleansing gels in order to check out what alternatives are out there for those with drier skin. First on my list is a kose cleansing gel, which I saw was described as weakly acidic. \n  \nAlso, I have dehydrated-prone and acne-prone skin that leans dry. Right now I'm using shea butter as a final step since no other facial oil has worked out for me, and it's going pretty well so far! I have the NOW Foods Shea butter tub. It can be a bit hard to spread, so I stuck a chopstick in and \"whipped\" it for a looser texture. However, it still tugs a bit when being applied to the skin. I found the best way to apply it is to take some of the whipped shea butter in my hand, warm it up and then apply it - either by spreading, or pressing my palms to my face.  \n  \nI've tried all sorts of sleeping packs and oils, but I'm finally waking up with skin that isn't dry or dehydrated. Vaseline also works decently, but shea butter seems to be the right mix of occlusive and emollient for my skin. Over the course of the night, some of it absorbs and I wake up with pretty good skin (much better than before, I can definitely say). I still might go back to playing around with vaseline during the winter months. We'll see how it goes.   \n  \nAnyway, the point of this tangent is that I recommend adding shea butter to the facial oil list haha. I know there's actually a shea oil, but I've never tried it and I believe the components of shea butter that are beneficial for dry skin are removed in the process of making shea oil. So it should be a bit lighter, if anyone is interested in a lighter take on shea butter.   \n  \nLastly, [this post about occlusives](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3v6yb8/psa_for_your_winter_dryness_most_oils_arent/) might be of interest to those with dry skin.   \n  \nETA: Wanted to clarify that I use lots of hydrating layers, but they mean nothing without a good occlusive.   \n  \nEdit: words",

        "body": "Not sure if my skin passes for dry because I usually try to deal with the dryness as soon as it appears and keep it as normal as possible. \n\nThings I use and I have found that work for me: \n\n* Tony Moly Aquaporin Moisture Foam Cleanser - this is a really basic cleanser, it's not even low pH, but I find it very gentle. \n* Vivant Skincare Green Tea Antioxydant Cleanser - this one is the gentlest cleanser I've used, it's low pH but it's so pricey. I will probably replace with Sulwhasoo Snowise next. It's the only cleanser I've used that leaves my skin like I haven't washed it but clean (if you know what I mean... xD). \n\nMy favorite creams for my driest moments during winter are: \n\n* Sulwhasoo Essential Firming Cream - I order sample jars of this on eBay and it comes out very affordable. This is my favorite moisturizer for normal/dry skin. It simply leaves my skin super hydrated and glowing, even if I step all the other steps in my routine. \n* Mizon S-venom Wrinkle Tox Cream - this cream is amazing as an occlusive, I absolutely fell in love with it! It left my skin so amazingly soft and hydrated. \n* Yves Rocher Nutrive Végétal 24h Comfort Nourishing Cream - this is a recent fave, for the price of 12€ for two tubs of this, it's perfect. I really like this line by YR for normal/dry skin, for those of you interested in trying non AB EU skincare, I'd highly recommend them, they are super affordable as well. \n\nMy favorite sleeping pack is: \n\n* Sulwhasoo Overnight Vitalizing Mask - this mask is magic for dry skin and soon as I start using this after getting dry patches they disappear. And it also helps for brighter skin tone. \n\nFavorite facial oil: \n\n* Pure cold-pressed avocado oil - I used this before I started using the Sulwhasoo sleeping mask. A 250 ml costs around 4€ in the supermarket, so I'd highly recommend it to everyone with dry skin. \n\nToner I am using for a while: \n\n* Yves Rocher Nutrive Végétal Velvety Toner - this is a really great locally available toner for me and for the price of 8€ for two bottles, I'd call this a pretty amazing deal. \n\nI am really interested in adding new stuff to my stash. I'd like to get a new toner and at the moment I am really hesitating between the Kikumasamune and the Hadalabo Hyaluronic Acid one, I would love if someone could tell me how they performed for them. \n\nI'd also like to buy serums/essences because I am only using actives at the moment. I am interested in Mizon Hyaluronic Acid Amoule, Cosrx Snail Essence, Cosrx Galactomyces Essence, Scinic Snail AIO, Scinic Propolis Ampoule, basically the choice is hard here. \n\nI've used couple of different gel creams but I don't find they are that amazing for dry skin, just a good thing to layer as a moisturizer. Ones I've used are \n\n* Mizon Watervolume Aqua Gel Cream \n* Mizon Aloe 90 Soothing Gel\n* Mizon Snail Recovery Gel \n* 3W Clinic Snail Mucus Soothing Gel \n\nFavorite sunscreens: \n\n* Bioré UV Perfect Milk - this is really great for dry skin, I imagine it will be my go to sunscreen during winter. \n* Missha All Around Safe Block Waterproof Sun \n\n\nOther random things that worked out for me: \n\n* Layering several layers of moisturizers instead of using one heavy layer of a moisturizing cream. I don't know why exactly that works the way it works, it might have to do something with the skin absorbing the ingredients more easily that way. \n* Careful with actives! It took me 3 months to build a tolerance to be able to use vitamin C daily (and once per day only) so I learned it the hard way, my skin doesn't like too much actives. I only use AHA once/twice per week and my skin looks really great right now. \n\n\nSorry for the non AB suggestions!",

Unfortunately, it's still kind of a mystery on how to use it properly for your skin, as there is a ton of misinformation out there on the world wide web and the tube basically tells you to just use it every day after washing your face. \n\n* * *\n\n##General Retinoid Tips\n\n[In my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/92hhpw/misc_skincare_ingredients_tretinoin_adapalene_and/), I talked a bit about the different types of retinoids available as well as some brief usage tips. In short:\n\n*   Wear SPF 30-50 every day while using any topical retinoid, including Differin.\n*   Avoid the eye area (lid and thin undereye) as well as the lips and areas next to the nasal passages.\n*   Apply a pea-sized amount. Dr. Dray demonstrates this amount in her video. It is quite literally roughly the size of a pea.\n*   Apply after cleansing and moisturizing your skin, once your moisturizer has dried down. Don't use overly occlusive moisturizers before Differin application, like heavy oils.\n*   Do not introduce new products right before or while using Differin. The reason for this is that if you begin to break out from the new product, it can be misinterpreted as breaking out from the Differin.\n*   Retinoids are not pregnancy safe. Please speak with your doctor if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant before using Differin or any topical retinoid, including retinol.\n\n[If you do best by watching videos, Dr. Dray has an excellent video on this process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF0Sw_wVqgs). \n\n* * *\n\n##Starting Differin\n\n\nWhen you first start using Differin, you'll want to ween your skin into it. While some skin is very tolerant and can withstand every night almost immediately, for more sensitive skin types this can be a bit more of a process. I've written some general guidelines below, but please note that all skin is different so you may need to tweak this depending on your own skin.\n\n*   **Tolerant Skin.** If your skin is quite tolerant of topical therapies and rarely shows signs of irritation and peeling, feel free to begin applying a pea-sized amount of  Differin once a day, at night, after cleansing and applied over your moisturizer as Dr. Dray demonstrates above. If your skin begins to feel tender or like it is burning, even after application of a bland moisturizer, cut down to usage every other day.\n*   **Normal/Sensitive Skin.** If your skin is sensitive or relatively normal, apply a pea-sized amount of Differin every other night (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, etc.), after cleansing and applied over your moisturizer, as demonstrated above. If your skin begins to feel tender, even after application of a bland moisturizer, cut down to every third night.\n*   **Very Sensitive Skin.** If your skin frequently shows signs of irritation to new products, particularly things like AHA, BHA, or vitamin C serums, or if you have rosacea, you may want to start by applying a pea-sized amount, over moisturized, clean skin every third night. This is where I started. After a few weeks, your skin should be able to tolerate every other night without excessive burning, tenderness, or peeling. If it does, cut back to every third night.\n\nIf your skin starts to feel a-okay with every third night or even every other night, try to bump up frequency. The goal is to be able to use it every night, but if your skin never feels comfortable at that point, that is okay - use it as frequently as you can. Remember that for everything, everyone's skin is different and beautiful. Your mileage may vary.\n\nWhat to Expect\n------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Some tenderness.** As a point of reference, my skin is more sensitive to being scratched, hot water, scruffy beards, and chemical filter sunscreens, particularly sunscreens with avobenzone, since starting Differin.\n*   **Micro-peels.** Wearing makeup will be a challenge during the adjustment period (about two months) of using Differin. Your skin will look and feel smooth, but application of foundation will show very fine peeling all over the skin. *This is okay and normal.* If your skin is ever showing thick \"sheets\" of peeling, you should back down on usage. *Your skin should not be shedding like a snake from Differin .1%*\n*   **Slightly more breakouts.** Experiencing slightly more breakouts for the first few weeks is normal and fine. They should not be extremely aggressive or much worse than the breakouts you were experiencing before, particularly if your acne is mild.\n*   **Dryness.** Dryness is very typical with any retinoid product, particularly during the first 4 weeks. Apply more moisturizer than usual and more frequently throughout the day, if needed. Do not use occlusives like Vaseline on your skin before applying Differin, as this can inhibit some of the absorption of Differin.\n\n* * *\n\n##Combining Therapies at Home\n\n\n**[Referring back to my post I made previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/92hhpw/misc_skincare_ingredients_tretinoin_adapalene_and/) once again, all retinoids (and frankly, all acne treatments) are best when used as a combination therapy all over the affected area (in this case, the face).** The following is a listing of the ingredients that can be combined with Differin and how to use them. \n\nBenzoyl Peroxide (BP)\n------------------------------------------------\n\nBP is not a new drug. First shown to be effective against acne in 1934 (though not explored as a treatment for acne until the 1960s when William Pace began to treat patients with a precipitated sulphur cream that contained BP), it is now often prescribed as a treatment for mild-to-moderate acne in conjunction with topical retinoids, particularly adapalene (Differin). The FDA has permitted use of benzoyl peroxide in OTC concentrations of 2.5-10%. \n\n[Details of randomised, double blind clinical studies using BP for the treatment of acne](https://skinolog.ist/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BP_studies.jpg).\n\nIt has keratolytic, moderate comedolytic, and antibacterial properties, \"which include the reduction of *P. acnes* and *Staphylococcus aureus* on skin.\"¹ It is a largely vehicle-dependent drug, meaning that the formulation matters. One journal notes this: \"Many formulations incorporate BP crystals that vary in size and do not necessarily fully dissolve completely or at the same rate. Larger crystals that are not capable of settling into the follicular ostia due to their size may randomly rest on the skin surface for more prolongued periods of time, thus producing scattered foci of 'hot spots' that may present as patches of cutaneous irritation.\"¹ \n\nIn addition, in three double-blind studies 2.5% BP gel was been found to be just as effective as 5% and 10% preparations with fewer side effects due to the lower concentration of the drug. \n\nTo combine with Differin at home, I recommend finding it in a wash, such as PanOxyl, or Differin's brand \"Daily Deep\" Cleanser, which contains 5% Benzoyl Peroxide. Feel free to use BP in this form twice a week or every other night - whichever you and your skin are most comfortable with. This is a form of short-contact therapy (an effective way to use benzoyl peroxide with less side effects) that can also be done with gels or creams as well, especially if cleansers are too drying for your skin. In one study on short-contact therapy:\n\n> *Short contact therapy utilizing a 2 minute skin contact time with BP 9.8% emollient foam used once daily over a 2 week duration was highly effective in reducing the quantity of P acnes organisms on the back and provided comparable colony count reduction to \"leave on\" therapy using BP 5.3% emollient foam. ([Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22777224))*\n\nFor gels or creams, I sound like a broken record about this brand, but I do genuinely love Paula's Choice BPO formulations. I have a small, travel-sized tube of their 5% formulation (which is not more efficacious than their 2.5%, but I had to test it!) and I love it. Unlike most BP formulations that crust up and sit as a film on the skin, the PC BP spreads easily and sinks in. Acne.org also has a pretty wonderful formulation of 2.5% BP that I used many years ago. \n\nAn additional note about BP is that is must be used *all over* to be effective as a combination treatment. While it is frequently billed a spot treatment product, BP really shines when it is allowed to treat acne *before* it becomes a problem, by blasting *P. acnes* and unseen microcomedones. This is why infrequent short-contact therapy is ideal, as the whole face can become quite sensitized when you're new to Differin. \n\nTo use a cream or gel as short contact therapy, use it over your moisturizer, before washing your face. If this bothers you, wash your face very gently first, removing any makeup or sunscreen, and patting dry with a towel. Apply a thin layer all over, let sit for two minutes, and rinse away. Apply your moisturizer while skin is still damp to prevent TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss) and let dry completely before applying a thin layer of Differin (about 20 minutes, if you are using it on the same day you use Differin). \n\nTo use a benzoyl peroxide cleanser, follow the instructions on the bottle, after removing any sunscreen and makeup with an oil-cleanser. Apply your moisturizer immediately after, while skin is still damp, to prevent TEWL and let dry completely before applying a thin layer of Differin. \n\nIf your skin feels particularly raw, painful, or chapped from the introduction of BP, cut down on frequency, use it on the \"rest\" day that you aren't using Differin, or remove it all together to let your skin heal before re-introducing. *Please note that these instructions are not for use with Duac, a prescription topical combining clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide*.\n\nSalicylic Acid (BHA)\n------------------------------------------------\n\nSalicylic acid (SA) is in a class of ingredients known as hydroxy acids, which I've referenced before. SA is a lipophilic (oil-friendly, meaning it is ideal for oilier skin types or in conjunction with oily products) compound and found in a plethora of products. While frequently considered as the oil-friendly version of AHA, it differs from AHAs in how it exfoliates the skin (desquamation, keratolytic) as well as it's ability to prevent the formation of comedones (comedolytic). To quote a journal that overviews the many OTC treatments for acne:\n\n> **[On AHA]** *At lower concentrations, AHA functions as an exfoliant, interrupting corneocyte adhesion in the upper SC by interfering with formation of ionic bonds. As a result, AHAs promote individual corneocyte desquamation and decrease corneocyte clumping, both of which lead to smoother skin texture and decreased visible scaling and flaking; a decrease in follicular hyperkeratois promotes resolution and prevents formation of AV lesions, especially comedones. ...* \n\n>**[On BHA/SA]** *Due to its desmolytic properties, salicylic acid promotes individual corneocyte desquamation, thus simulating natural exfoliation, and exerts moderate comedolytic activity. The desmolytic and comedolytic properties of salicylic acid are concentration-dependent. In fact, salicylic acid is not keratolytic. Rather, it exerts its effect on SC desquamation by breaking the bonds created by corneodesmosomes, also called the “rivets” or “staples” of the SC, which sustain the adherence between contiguous corneocytes. ... The “physiological” desquamation provided by salicylic acid provides smoother texture and appearance to the skin and can give the illusion of decreased pore sizes.*\n\nThe journal goes on to add: \"Unfortunately, lower concentrations of salicylic acid may provide only a modest desmolytic [the process of breaking down carbon-to-carbon double bonds, such as between skin cells] activity, thus producing minimal therapeutic effects.\" In shorter terms, your mileage may vary. Some people find great success with BHAs while others feel like it does very little for them.\n\nOver the counter formulations can appear in 0.05% to 5%, while higher concentrations of SA are reserved for prescriptions and chemical peels. \n\nThese features make it less ideal (and much less studied) than BP for combination therapy with Differin, especially in lower percentages or untested formulations, but for some it may prove useful or even better than BP. \n\nTo use it with Differin, look for unscented washes or leave-on applications and use on clean, moisturized skin, before applying Differin or every-other-night, when not using Differin. Many people like Stridex pads due to their wide availability, but the formulation can be irritating to some. My personal favorite is (again - I swear I am not sponsored, I just really love their active ingredients) Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid (Extra Strength, if using her acne line). CosRX also has a couple products, if you prefer Asian beauty products. \n\nFor cleansers, there are fewer options. Clinique has one that is fairly pricey and Dr. Dray loves the classic orange, oil-free Neutrogena cleanser in the pump (not the bar!). Use after removing makeup, following the directions on the bottle, and immediately apply your moisturizer to prevent TEWL. Once dry, apply a thin layer of Differin. \n\nThe risks with BHA combination therapy are largely the same as BP - redness, dryness, tenderness. If you begin to feel any of these effects, cut down on the frequency of usage of BHA before cutting back on Differin. If needed, remove the BHA entirely until your skin heals.\n\nGlycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid (AHAs)\n------------------------------------------------\n\nAHAs or Alpha Hydroxy Acids are a group of products that include glycolic, lactic, mandelic, and fruit acids. While the exact mechanism of these ingredients is rather poorly understood, it is known that they exert some effect by thinning the stratum corneum (SC) - the upper most layer of the epidermis - as well as dispersing basal layer melanin and increasing collagen synthesis in higher concentrations. \n\nAs mentioned above, AHAs can be helpful for some conditions of hyperkeratinization where the epidermal thickening impairs the SC permeability, resulting in skin fissures (microfissuring and macrofissuring). The most extreme examples of macrofissuring is usually seen on hands or feet, where the skin may split or \"fissure.\" At low concentrations (below 8%), AHAs disrupt the corneocyte adhesion. To re-iterate from above:\n\n>*At lower concentrations, AHA functions as an exfoliant, interrupting corneocyte adhesion in the upper SC by interfering with formation of ionic bonds. As a result, AHAs promote individual corneocyte desquamation and decrease corneocyte clumping, both of which lead to smoother skin texture and decreased visible scaling and flaking; a decrease in follicular hyperkeratois promotes resolution and prevents formation of AV lesions, especially comedones. Higher concentrations of AHAs (8-10%) can lead to both epidermolysis and thickening of the dermis.*\n\nFor some, this action can prove helpful when used in conjunction with retinoids, which most frequently cause peeling and dryness. \n\nTo use with Differin, look for low percentages to start with (4-8%) in leave-on products. Glycolic, while the most effective form of AHA, is quite irritating to some skin types due to it's ability to work quickly. Mandelic and lactic acid are especially gentle forms of AHAs due to their larger molecules that penetrate slower and may allow some people to use AHAs when they otherwise wouldn't be able to. \n\nTo start, add them to your routine on your off-nights and work up tolerability from there. Some people also find value in using short-contact therapy with AHAs - particularly glycolic - though this limits their efficacy, particularly with forms that penetrate much slower, such as mandelic acid. Some popular brands of AHAs are Paula's Choice (8% Glycolic Gel), Pixi Glow Tonic (note: this contains several plant extracts, which can be very irritating), Nip + Fab pads (also contain fragrance and plant extracts), The Ordinary (7% Glycolic Solution as well as 10% Lactic), Stratia (10% Mandelic), and as CosRX (Glycolic Acid). \n\nIt is not advised to use an AHA in a cleanser, as it is often not on the skin long enough to create noticeable differences.\n\nAs with all of the other above combinations, if you begin to experience redness, soreness, dryness, or irritation, cut down frequency and remove entirely if needed to allow your skin to heal.\n\n\nAzelaic Acid (AzA)\n------------------------------------------------\n\nA natural component of everyone's skin, azelaic acid (AzA) is also a viable combination therapy, and there are increasingly more products available over-the-counter that contain this ingredient. While AzA is not frequently prescribed for acne, it can be very helpful for some skin types, particularly those that are very sensitive. \n\nUnfortunately, there are no good studies around AzA when used with Differin, but there are studies around AzA in comparison to clindamycin and BP. Specifically, one study showed it to be as effective as 5% BP as well as 1% clindamycin in a randomized controlled study with 351 patients (BP gel) and 229 patients (clindamycin).\n\n> *Azelaic acid 15% gel proved to be as effective as BPO and clindamycin with median % reduction of the inflamed lesion (papules and pustules) of 70%, and 71% respectively. The azelaic acid gel was well-tolerated, the side effects (local burning and irritation) were distinctly less than with BPO but more pronounced than with clindamycin. Despite these side effects, the treatment was well-accepted by the majority of patients. (Abstract, [source](http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/16281587))*\n\nAzA is also bacteriostatic, meaning that it can suppress the ability for bacteria to reproduce, which can help inflammation. It also suppresses hyper-proliferation of keratin, which is a factor in acne. \n\nUnfortunately, it does take time to work and the side-effects when initially starting off can be aggravating. The most common side-effects are itching and stinging as well as mild dryness or peeling. This tends to resolve within 4 weeks. This can be difficult to push through. As someone who uses AzA, I can say that the initial itching upon application canfeel very intense and aggravating to deal with, though icing my skin helped me push through the worst days. Your mileage may vary.\n\nTo use AzA with Differin, I recommend trying to use it in your “off” nights, when not using Differin. If your skin tolerates this fine, feel free to use it every night. AzA is typically pretty gentle, but the itching can feel *very* intense if you have never used it before, especially when used on sensitive skin or skin that is sensitized from other ingredients.\n\nThere are a few trustworthy AzA topicals available over-the-counter in the US. Paula’s Choice makes one that contains 10% AzA and 2% BHA, which I reviewed. The Ordinary also makes a 10% AzA, though it feels quite powdery and silicone-y, which some people dislike. Garden of Wisdom is another option, especially for people sensitive to many ingredients. Their product is an 8% serum that receives a lot of love, though I have never used it myself.\n\nAnother option is Melazepam Cream (20% AzA). However, I want to mention that this formula contains two oils, which may inhibit some of it’s efficacy. Specifically, in a study involving 15% AzA, waiting until after moisturizing seemed to result in greater penetration of AzA in all moisturizers tested except for one, which contained an oil (macadamia nut oil). It was surmised that this was due to the occlusivity of the oil. Another potential issue is that Melazepam is made in Israel – something that may concern some consumers.\n\nIf you feel irritation or the itching is incredibly intense, try to back down on usage. I have found that applying a cool ice pack (wrapped in a towel so you aren't pressing such an extreme cold to your skin) can really help soothe some of the \"itch.\"\n\nSulfur\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTopical sulfur is another option, though hard to find and frequently found in masks and other short-contact products. Sulfur exhibits antimicrobial properties and has been used for hundreds of years to treat AV as well as seborrheic dermatitis. It is frequently found in formulas up to 10% in combination with other products, particularly resorcinol, which is thought to be antibacterial, antifungal, and keratolytic.\n\nUnfortunately, topical sulfur frequently causes mild irritation and sensitization, and has limited popularity.\n\nQueen Helene’s Mint Julep Mask is a popular product with sulfur, as well as the ProActiv mask. I would advise anyone using the Mint Julep Mask in particular with Differin to be cautious, as the clay (kaolin) can be very drying to skin that is already dry and peeling, and the fragrance content is fairly high, making it a potentially extremely irritating choice of treatment.\n\n---\n\nWhatever you decide, it is important to be consistent and not treat either the Differin or the combination product as a spot treatment. While this is a popular way to avoid irritation and sensitization, it only treats the symptom, not the disease, which is to say that it is only treating the comedone once it has surfaced as a larger issue rather than treating the root of the problem: the formation of microcomedones. Differin takes roughly twelve weeks to see full results, and products like AzA can take even longer. Whatever you decide, stick with it and listen to your skin by backomg off when it feels a bit more sensitive and moving up slowly in application when you feel you're adjusting.\n\n---\n\n##Sources\n\n\n1.

    "body": "**One year and two months or so of bodyweight/weight lifting/circus training**\n\nMale, age 26, 5'7\"\n\n* Start weight: 135lbs\n* Middle weight: 182lbs\n* Current weight: 151lbs\n\n**Visual Progress:**\n\n[Starting weight @ 135lbs in shirt](http://imgur.com/W4F7BzH)\n\n[Bulk results @ 182lbs](http://imgur.com/q2HU7x8)\n\n[Current @ 151lbs in shirt](http://imgur.com/a/pTuAS)\n\n[Current weekly progress pic set](http://imgur.com/a/DxFCV)\n\n\n**The beginning**\n\nAugust 2014, I broke up with my girlfriend. Looking back on it, the pain and the torture I put myself through, it was probably one of the darkest times in my life. I had moved 200 miles to be with this girl to a new place. It's quite surreal to find out your girlfriend of more than five years was cheating on you as you signed your lease to be with her.\n\nI guess it was a culmination of a lot of things. A building sadness, disappointment in myself, lack of motivation. I had hit rock bottom without even realizing it, and my breakup was just the wake up call. After the shock hit me, I sat in the dark in my new apartment alone and waited. I waited for some dark anger to sweep me away, but all I did was hit the solid bottom of despair and sadness. Pathetic, really, but this was, at the moment, the culmination of so many feelings that I couldn't handle. Is there anything worse than wishing you just don't have to wake up the next morning?\n\nWell, I did wake up. And I kept on waking up every day from that point. There comes a point where you realize that your life just doesn't end, and you either continue to live in a gray, dull haze, hoping for someone else to come sweep you away, or something snaps. I found that I was tired of being sad and dull and boring--I realized now I had nothing holding me back. Why wish and wait, when you can just go out and **do**? It was a surge of strength beyond hope. After all, rock bottom makes a great foundation.\n\n**Starting out (Month 1)**\n\nIn late October, I started with the sub beginner routine. After my year of experience, I still find myself always referencing where I started. If anyone is questioning where to begin, DO THE BEGINNER PROGRAM AND STICK WITH IT. This will give you a solid base on which to build other skills and even slowly start to branch out into your own programming.\n\n**Building the Foundation (Months 2-8)**\n\nOf course, this all lasted about a month before I was way too hyped up about exercise and went out and purchased Foundations 1, Foundations 2, and Handstand 1.\n\nhttps://www.gymnasticbodies.com/gb-courses/\n\nGreat purchases, great routines. If anyone is looking for a systematic and almost guaranteed builder of gymnastics mobility and strength I highly recommend these programs as long as you follow them to a T and are always honest with your progressions. I made it most of the way through Foundations 2, and Handstands 1 really helped me build up my handstands to where they are now.\n\nIt was at this period that I also learned there was such a thing as too MUCH exercise and food. Despite working out almost every single day, I had taken the ol' bulking routine a little too far. I developed tendonitis from pushing myself too hard and not listening to my body and at the end of my bulk, I looked like this:\n\n[FAT](http://imgur.com/Lao79Wv) [FAT](http://imgur.com/PJ66DKk) [FAT](http://imgur.com/q2HU7x8)\n\nI was SO much stronger, and despite my mega bulk, way more limber, but the truth was that I was also fat. Fat and strong. The bulk worked--I went from 135lbs to 182lbs. Curious, I went to the gym and tested my **1RM**s to see how everything carried over:\n\n* Bench Press: 175lbs\n* Squat: 205lbs\n* Deadlift: 295lbs\n\nKeep in mind that all of these lifts were probably (almost 100% guaranteed) garbage form and I would be ashamed of them today if I had recorded them, but I was happy.\n\n**The Cut (Months 9-14)**\n\nThe best decision I ever got was getting a trainer. Finally, someone to call me on all of my bullshit. He broke the news to me: /u/SomethingsAwry, you're FAT. Now that I had at least the base, it was time to chip away the delicious marbling I had accumulated. From here I was able to go from 182lbs down to 148.5lbs. Here are my final progress pictures:\n\n[FINAL RESULT](http://imgur.com/a/DxFCV)\n\nA little before this period I also started circus training. I'll go into that a bit more when I talk about my training.\n\n**DIET**\n\n* **Bulking**\n\nFor my bulk, I applied milk liberally and ate everything. My most cooked meal was carnitas and [meat slop](http://www.silverhydra.com/2011/10/meat-slop/). I seriously had no idea what I was doing other than making the connection that calories made me strong, so unless you're vastly underweight, it's best to ignore what I did here.\n\n* **Cutting**\n\nHere is where it gets interesting. With my trainer we went with IIFYM and we set up macros for six meals a day:\n\n* 35P/30C/10F x5\n* 35P/0C/10F x1\n\nMoving to:\n\n* 35P/20C/10F x5\n* 35P/0C/10F x1\n\nAnd currently:\n\n* 35P/20C/10F x3\n* 35P/0C/10F x3\n\nThe goal here was to cut VERY slowly in order to preserve gains. I'm talking about 1 to 2 lbs a week slow.\n\nHere is the list of food choices I narrowed things down to so building meals was easy:\n\n* Protein: chicken, lean cuts of steak, fish, turkey, egg whites (ratio of 6 egg whites to 1 whole egg), whey, caseinate, any high quality protein powder \n* Veggies: basically anything green, broccoli, green beans, cauliflower, asparagus\n* Fats: all natural peanut butter, extra virgin olive oil, grapeseed oil, macadamia nut oil, almonds, cashews, walnuts, pecans\n* Carbs: oatmeal, rice, cous cous, potatoes, yams, cream of rice, Ezekiel bread, fruit\n\nI did manage to build some lean muscle mass on my cut, as well as preserve and build upon most of my strength. Can't wait for my slow bulk! My repeated bulk cycle will be:\n\n* 16 weeks @ 1lb per week\n* 4 week maintenance\n* 8 week slow cut\n\n**Current Workout Routine**\n\nJust a basic PPL that I do six times a week. Cardio is 5x a week, along with one HIIT session.\n\nDay One:\n\n* Squats 5/3/1 Program with Pistol squats until failure\n* Deadlifts 3x5\n\nDay Two:\n\n* Bench press OR weighted pushups/pushup variations\n* Incline bench press\n* Cuban rotations\n* Chest flys and deltoid flys\n* Front raise OR planche training progressions\n* Dumbell lateral raises\n* Tricep rope pulldowns\n* Skull crushers or rope overhead extension\n\nDay Three:\n\n* Pinwheel curls\n* Reverse barbell curls\n* Weighted chin ups then bodyweight till failure (currently 3x6 55lbs, failure with 18 chins)\n* Weighted pull ups then bodyweight till failure (currently 3x6 35lbs, failure with 13 pullups)\n* Weighted dips then bodyweight till failure (currently 3x9 35lbs, failure with 12 DEEP BW dips)\n* Rows (machine or ring rows)\n\n\nThis is the basic format of my workouts. I also toss in a LOT of bodyweight exercises that fit in during that day at the gym. Examples include muscle up training, skin the cats, planche work, russian dips etc. A lot of things I'm probably forgetting to mention are also done on a GTG style such as side lever work and front lever. I am close to both my side and front lever at this stage.\n\nAfter the main body of my work, I cool down with cardio. After that comes abs (all of the bodyline work, hollow holds etc), any GTG work I feel that I still need to do, and AT LEAST 20 minutes of hand stand training every single day. I alternate holds/skill and handstand strength work every day so I'm not tired out and have recovery time. If you want to get good at handstands, you must do handstands. Saturdays and Sundays I'm starting to take my Cyr wheel out to spin around.\n\nI'm also taking a variety of circus training classes: handstands, aerial straps, ropes, trapeze, silks. If there is a circus school near you, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. You will not regret it. I have been able to juggle at least three separate classes per week, all while going to the gym 6x a week.\n\n**What I Achieved**\n\nWhile I'm not Yuri Marmerstein yet, here are a few things I've taken away over the year that I find notable:\n\n* Squat: 5x5 @ 225lbs\n* Deadlift: 3x3 @ 315lbs\n* Adv. Tuck Front Lever\n* Vertical human flag\n* 45 second+ l-sit on paralettes\n* Bar and ring muscle ups\n* Russian dips\n* 55lbs weighted pull up\n* 75lbs weighted chin up\n* 30 second straddle and straight handstand\n\n**What I learned**\n\n* You do not need to hit rock bottom to change yourself, but it certainly helps. People are so bad at listening to themselves; you might be stressed out or anxious or depressed, but WHY? Once you find that reason, you can start to work on it. I was unhappy with myself and not chasing after what I really wanted. You can listen now, or you can listen when everything crumbles around you. Make the call.\n* Listen to your body. I developed pretty severe tendonitis that absolutely set me back for at least a month or more because I thought I could power through things.\n* PAY ATTENTION TO FORM AND ROM. That goes along with the last thing I mentioned. DO NOT PROGRESS BEYOND GOOD FORM. I have deloaded several times at points just to focus on good form and making sure I have full range of motion. This will save you so much heartbreak and injuries down the road. Keep that ego in check.\n* Join a community. The /r/bodyweightness community is wonderful, and having people I could talk to and share my experiences with was an integral part of the healing factor, and a good reason why I'm so motivated every day. My circus community is just as wonderful.\n* Take progress pictures! You can look back and laugh (or cry)! Sadly I only have pictures from the last six months, but these are the ones that make me look the best anyways, right????\n\n**CUT PROGRESS PICS BY MONTH**\n\n* [May](http://imgur.com/a/7nLi1)\n* [June](http://imgur.com/a/98NbW)\n* [July](http://imgur.com/a/EUopF)\n* [August](http://imgur.com/a/pM2tw)\n* [September](http://imgur.com/a/MtnkD)\n* [October](http://imgur.com/a/oYAar)\n* [November](http://imgur.com/a/DxFCV)\n\n**Take Away**\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYzMYcUty6s\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-sfG8BV8wU",

I read your earlier post on Top 10-20 Cleansing Oils & Gels also. \n\nI'm looking to introduce a new cleanser to my daily routine and was playing with the idea of an oil cleanser.  So much choice, but this should make it easier.  Ideally, I'm looking for something without propylene glycol. butylene glycol, essential oils or added fragrance.  And no parabens - was shocked to see Phytomer still incorporating these!  The ATrue Black Tea Cleanser in your previous post looked interesting; simple list of ingredients, although ironically green tea is the first ingredient in the list, rather than black tea!  Aromatica Orange Cleansing Sherbet looks interesting, as does Clinique - so simple but effective.  Have you any idea what Kakadu (reference Sidmool) means??\n\nWhich do you use incidentally?

I have also incorporated the  **Be Minimalist's AA & TXA serums since 20/02/2021**  into my routine,so they are being reviewed here while the CTM+sunscreen products have gained my trust enough to be holy grail(s)! \n[You can fill yourself in regarding my skin type and concerns by reading this](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/lmjcxq/look_what_arrived_in_the_mail_today_upcoming_post/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and consider the routine to be nothing greater than anecdotal evidence :)\n\nPS: The length of the post might make it look like I accidently published a scientific paper on the Internet but I have compensated for that by using the '🐳' emoji as pointers because nothing emotes joy like a whale mindlessly sprouting water into the ocean :P\n\n🔹 **MORNING ROUTINE** 🔹\n\n🐳 Cleanser:  **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel**\n\n   \n   🐳Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   🐳Serum: **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%**\n   \n\n   🐳Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night             Repair**\n\n\n   🐳Moisturizer:  **Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**\n   \n\n    🐳Sunscreen :  **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++**\n\n\n\n🔹 **NIGHT ROUTINE** 🔹\n\n    \n   🐳Cleanser :  **Cera Ve Salicylic Acid Cleanser**\n\n   \n  🐳Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   🐳Serum:  **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA**\n\n\n   🐳Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair**\n\n    \n    🐳Moisturizer:  **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion**\n\n    \n    🐳Replaying that moment when I called my class teacher 'mummy' in the 7th grade before wrapping up the day is a cult ritual.\n\n\n\n\n🔵 **CLEANSER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water (Aqua), Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Cocoglucoside, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Chloride, Ceteareth-60 Myristyl Glycol, Glycol Palmitate, Glycerin, Peg-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Propylele Glycol, Sorbic Acid, Disodium Edta, Fragrance, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract.\n\n🐳 **Application** : Just like how *normal* people apply a face wash. Normal is the operative word here because ain't nobody washing their face like actors in a commercial,that's clearly abnormal.\n\n🐳 **What works** : This was recommended by my dermat after a bout of eczema 2 years back and I absolutely swear by it. It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured. [I brought mine from this one.](https://instagram.com/_vivanka_chennai?igshid=5brie36vc4w2)\n\n\n\n🔵 **TONER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **DermaFique All Important Toner** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260\n\n🐳 **Application** : I got this transferred into a mist spray bottle because I quite enjoy the feeling of being spring irrigated. So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you! Rest your eyes for a bit,it did endure quite a bit of a strain with this one :P",

    "body": "Hello! So beplain initially caught my attention as I’ve heard the brand was made based on customer feedback in Korea. The ingredients list for these products are relatively simple so there was little worry for breakouts. It definitely did not disappoint!\n\nA little background: I live in a humid country with dehydrated, combination, acne-prone skin. My main concerns with my skin right now is CCs, calming and hydrating.\n\n-\n**Greenful pH-Balanced Cleansing Foam** ***4.5/5 MRP***\n\n*Glycerin, Mung Bean Extract, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Lauryl Betaine, Betaine, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Extract, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phaseolus Radiatus Seed Powder, Dextrin, Allantoin, Water, Ceramide NP, Green Tea Powder, Ethylhexylglycerin*\n\nCompared to all cleansers I’ve used so far, this was probably one of the best. It’s a pretty light green with a thick paste texture, and has small bits of what seems to be mung bean. In my opinion, you can smell mung bean, just slightly, but I didn’t mind it at all as it reminds me of those asian dessert places haha. The cleanser itself foams, but for me it wasn’t stripping at all. The cleanser contains lots of extracts which could be good for the skin, but honestly since it’s a wash-off product, I couldnt feel any of the benefits :”) The downside would be the price. In my country, it is sold for $12 for 80ml, which is more expensive than any other cleansers I’ve ever used :(\n\n-\n**Chamomile pH-Balanced Toner** ***3.5/5 WNRP***\n\n*Chamomile Flower Extract (80.65%), Propanediol, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Trehalose, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Betaine, Butylene Glycol, Allantoin, Cellulose Gum, Disodium EDTA, Ceramide-NP, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin*\n\nOkay so this was a 3.5 for me, just because of my skin type and the weather in my country. For oily-combo skin in humid weather, this toner felt slightly too moisturizing, so it felt kind of heavy for me. This would definitely be amazing for dry skin in the summer or oily skin in the winter. It’s a runny toner with a slight slip if you rub it against your hands. I could smell a bit of the chamomile as I apply it to my face but it wasn’t overpowering at all. It was soothing, but the main thing it did for my skin was honestly the moisturizing/hydrating component. If that was what you’re looking for in a runny toner, I’d definitely recommend this!\n\n-\n**Cicaful ampoule** ***4.5/5 WRP***\n\n*Centella Asiatica Extract (81.44%), Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyglycerin-3, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Tromethamine, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylate/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Hydroxyacetophenone*\n\nI understand you probably are sick with all the cica products dominating the market, but this ampoule was *really good* for me. This ampoule is clear and very viscous, almost like a gel but still relatively runny. As you rub it on your skin it becomes like water, and sinks in reaaally quick. I’ve heard people say this was hydrating for them, but it wasn’t *that* hydrating for me. The calming effect was *amazing* though—redness in my face can minimize as soon as a few hours after application. It felt cooling and very soothing to the skin. Though I would say I run out of the bottle relatively quicker than other serums haha. If you need a calming, no fuss ampoule with minimal ingredients and low breakout risk, this is definitely one to try out!\n\n-\n**Chamomile pH-Balanced Lotion** ***3/5 WNRP***\n\n*Chamomile Flower Extract, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Ethylhexyl Stearate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Kelp Extract, Eclipta Prostrata Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Acmella Oleracea Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Purified Water, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Butylene Glycol, Squalane (Plant-derived), Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Fructooligosaccharides, Beta-Glucan, Allantoin, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide-NP, Sodium hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Pentylene Glycol*\n\nCompared to other lotions/emulsions I’ve tried, I don’t think I prefer this one. This lotion was a bit thick and holds it’s shape better when you try making it run down. It has the chamomile smell similar to the toner, but far more minimal that you really can’t smell it unless you’re trying to. It’s very moisturizing, probably enough if you use this as a moisturizer in the summer. It spreads well and you don’t need a lot to cover your entire face, but it sinks in less quick, so after using it, it feels like you’ve put a legit cream moisturizer on your face. This was *not* a bad product, but it’s probably better geared towards those with dry skin.\n\n-\n**Hyaluronic Aqua Moisturizer** ***4/5 WRP***\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Methyl Trimethicone, Methylpropanediol, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP, Copolymer, Raffinose, Betaine, Sodium Hyaluronate (100ppm), Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid (100ppm), Allantoin, Madecassoide, Beta-glucan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ethylcellulose, Butylene Glycol Cocoate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Polyquaternium-51*\n\nRight off the bat, the texture surprised me. This came out as a translucent balm-like gel with no scent, like a less strong vaseline, so for those with dehydrated skin, this one is for you! I was kinda scared using it thinking it was going to be heavy, but I have been using it at night and it’s done wonders for my skin the next morning. Perhaps because my skin is dehydrated, but with this product, my skin texture really improved. As this also was not like a very emollient moisturizer, it felt like it was a layer sealing in all the serum and toner I used before and did not feel clogging at all. Honestly, this product turned out faaaaaar better than I expected!\n\n-\n\nOverall I am really impressed with the brand. None of their products broke me out, which is incredible! All in all I’d say I recommend the cleanser and the cica ampoule for all skin types, the chamomile line for dry skin types (or combo/oily in the winter) and the aqua moisturizer for dehydrated skin. I hope this review was helpful for you and have a great day!",

    "body": "Hey all,\n\nSo over at SCA, brand discussions used to be A Thing (tm). I wanted to start it up again, and figured this was the best sub for it.\n\nI'm starting with a very easy and popular brand: The Ordinary. Feel free to suggest me what should be discussed next and I'll see about posting them weekly.\n\nA bit of a format for your posts:\n\n* **Product Name**\n* **Price**\n* **Skin type and concerns**\n* **Mini-review** - What did you like about it? Dislike about it? How did your skin react?\n\n\n---\n\nSo I'll start a bit:\n\n* **Product Name** - The Ordinary Sea Buckthorn Fruit Oil\n* **Price** - $14.90/30mL\n* **Skin type and concerns** - Hypersensitive, rosacean. Redness, acne, aging.\n* **Mini-review** - \n\n\nIt comes in a glass, UV-protective bottle with a dropper, and like every product I’ve ever used from the Ordinary, feels sturdy. No weird screw-cap issues with this bottle!\n\nWhen I first tried this oil, I put it on with a 1:1 ratio with my jojoba oil. BIG MISTAKE. I am pretty fair, so the generous ratio of sea-buckthorn oil to jojoba turned my face orange. And not like the warm glow of a good fake tan, but the yellow of “holy hell this turmeric mask just turned me orange dear god what have I done.” After this first night, I began to dilute it in a 1:5 sea-buckthorn to jojoba ratio, but it was still quite noticeably yellow-orange.\n\nMy boyfriend swore he couldn’t see it in low lighting, but later brought in my white pillowcase to shame me and ask if I had been doing something less than appropriate with my pillowcase at night. Thankfully these stains washed out easily.\n\nThis strong red-orangey hue is due to the high contents of beta-carotene in the oil. It’s the same coloring that gives the famed Stratia Liquid Gold it’s color.\n\nIn the morning, my skin still appeared a bit yellow, and indeed, when I swiped a cotton across my face with some Hada Labo, the cotton square pulled back with a light yellow tint.\n\nUnfortunately, after a couple of days, the oil did begin to break me out. At first, it was just a small cyst on my forehead, which I discounted as being due to hair products and my new cut sitting on my skin a bit. However, as the days went on, one cropped up on my jawline during a normally clear timeframe of the month. This is when I realized it was probably due to the oil.\n\nAs soon as I stopped using the oil every night and went back to my typical routine, the spots began to subside.\n\nThis is not entirely surprising for me. I had a hunch that macadamia nut oil wasn’t a good fit for me years prior, and sea-buckthorn oil is pretty similar to it. I also just don’t seem to do well with high oleic oils in general, as I’ve had breakouts from argan oil in the past.\n\nI’d recommend it for night use only, especially fair skins. If you do well with macadamia nut oil, argan, tamanu, olive, hazelnut, sweet almond, apricot, or even coconut, you may do well with sea-buckthorn oil.\n",

        "body": "To preface, all the brand/owner drama has really turned me off the brand, so I don't see myself repurchasing anything. Will use up what I have bc I have it/isn't breaking me out or anything, just...not going to support that whole...everything.. That said, I've tried a fair amount of products from TO's line. Skin type and concerns: dry; redness, some large pores, acne is mainly hormonal.\n\n**100% Cold-Pressed Virgin Marula Oil**\n\n**Price:** 9.90 USD \n**Claims:** This luxurious-feeling oil fights free radical damage, hydrates the skin, promotes elasticity, and helps restore a radiant tone. \n**Mini-Review:** for the price, it's fine. Is it a dupe for the brand of drunken elephants?? nah. but, it's not bad for the price. It sinks in eventually (DE does faster), doesn't smell strongly. It didn't do anything amazing for me (already used oils prior, so didn't have a revelation with this one - it's an oil. does oil stuff. cool.), but also didn't break me out. Haven't tried it for hair, but I think I'll start bc I have other face oils I prefer to this one that I want to use up.\n\n\n**Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution**\n\n**Price:** 8.70 USD \n**Claims:** This treatment gently exfoliates the skin to restore a clear, radiant appearance. It improves the look of uneven tone and texture with regular use. \n**Mini-Review:** I don't notice a difference. Can sorta feel it when I apply it after I haven't used it for a while (also, if you have any open cuts or anything, it sucks/will sting), but if using it nightly my skin adjusts I guess. Was already using Pixi's glycolic serum (not the tonic) so wasn't new to GA, and prior to that used DE's Framboos. I didn't notice a change between any switching of GA products, but I honestly don't know if GA does a lot for me or not. More recently, I feel like it might be drying my skin a bit, so I'm less wild on it and just looking to finish it off (have used half the bottle - which, for price, it's massive and a solid deal if you can find it in-stock).\n\n\n**Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG**\n\n**Price: 6.70 USD** \n**Claims:** This treatment visibly reduces the appearance of dark circles, under-eye bags, and puffiness in the eye contour area. \n**Mini-Review:** I notice a difference right after using (more hydrated looking and plump), but idk if there is really any longer-term change to mine (have been using this for 6+ months). I won't be looking for a replacement for this from another brand, just sticking with an eye cream.\n\n\n**Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n**Price:** 6.79 USD \n**Claims:** This treatment resurfaces the skin to promote a bright, even tone and a smooth, soft texture. For a more gentle formulation, try The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA. \n**Mini-Review:** I like this one, and will look for a replacement when I'm closer to finishing. I feel like I noticed the change (brighter, clearer skin) using this acid more than trying any others (outside of HA for hydrating). I use another product with LA and love it (Pixi Peel and Polish - is both chemical and physical exfoliation), so might just stick with that once I finish this one (not dupes, just also works well for me - ymmv).\n\n\n**Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n**Price:** 5.90 USD \n**Claims:** This treatment reduces the appearance of blemishes, redness, enlarged pores, uneven tone, and oily skin. It promotes clearer, brighter, and smoother skin while balancing sebum production. \n**Mini-Review:** Also liked this one and am going to look into an alternative. This is another product where my skin had a jump of improvement after introducing the product, and I notice a difference when I stop using it. I've used other products with Niacinamide and had solid results as well, so I think it is an ingredient that works well for me.\n\n\n**Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5**\n\n**Price:** 6.80 USD \n**Claims:** This treatment hydrates the skin and creates a smooth, supple, and plumped-up appearance. It works by replenishing moisture in multiple layers of the skin. \n**Mini-review:** Personally, the worst for me. Was extremely sticky/tacky to the point of pilling. Didn't really notice that my skin was plumper/more hydrated, as it felt like it sat on top more and dried down sticky than absorbing. Couldn't use under makeup, unpleasant to use at night. Ended up destashing, and has been the only destashed TO product for me to date.\n\n\n**Salicylic Acid 2% Solution**\n\n**Price:** 5.30 USD \n**Claims:** This treatment exfoliates deep inside the walls of pores to fight acne, oily skin, and blemishes. It promotes smoother skin texture and visible clarity with regular use. \n**Mini-Review:** I like it, would look for replacement when closer to running out. I tend to use it when I either have a bit of acne, or feel it coming on, to help clear it faster and I notice that it does help with that.\n\n\n**AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution**\n\n**Price:** 7.20 USD \n**Claims:** This treatment exfoliates at multiple levels in the skin to fight acne and restore an even, radiant tone. It also smooths the skin’s texture and reduces the look of fine lines with regular use. \n**Mini-Review:** Use it about once a week and it really helps sort of husk off dry/flaking skin. I have some other chemical peels that work similarly, so once I finish probably won't look to replace it. Do like it, though.\n\n\n**Azelaic Acid Suspension 10%**\n\n**Price:** 7.90 USD \n**Claims:** This treatment brightens the skin, reduces the look of blemishes, and promotes an even tone and texture. It also fades hyperpigmentation and reduces the redness associated with rosacea. \n**Mini-Review:** Didn't make skin better, but also didn't make skin worse. Used it all up in about 3 months, didn't see a difference on redness front. Texture where I have some is the same as well. Pilled alone, horrid with makeup (one of my worst makeup days was due to this - literally pilled off and took my foundation with it making it look very splotchy). Began just using it at night, still pilled a bunch and I just used it to fully pan it.\n\nedit: formatting",

        "body": "This is such a great thread idea!! Thank you for posting!\n\nI just want to preface this by saying that I no longer use Deciem products for ethical reasons. I felt it was the right thing to do after a lot of what went on with the company, but also don't begrudge anyone else for using them. Everyone has a different approach to skincare, and YMMV applies to our buying habits as well as our actual routines. \n\nI'm not mentioning this to take a holier-than-thou attitude or stir up drama, but I just felt I couldn't discuss the brand without mentioning the ethical dimension. Despite my dislike for the company, these reviews are still completely honest reflections of my experiences with their products.\n                               \n********************************************************\n\n**Product Name:** 100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rosehip Seed Oil\n\n**Price:** $9.80/30ml\n\n**Skin type and concerns:** DRY, acne-prone, PIE, can lean dehydrated\n\n**Mini-review:** This is my favorite facial oil I've used so far, and the one TO product I really miss. Other ropsehip seed oils are either very expensive, or have questionable reviews on Amazon (would love recs!!) It's not too greasy and doesn't break me out, but still moisturizes adequately. I didn't notice any of the changes in hyperpigmentation that other users have mentioned, but all in all it was very pleasant to use and was just right for my skin. I feel like oils are especially YMMV, but if you struggle with both dry skin and acne, this may be a good one to try. \n\n*********************************************************************************************\n\n**Product Name:** 100% Plant-Derived Squalane\n\n**Price:** $7.90/30ml\n\n**Skin type and concerns:** DRY, acne-prone, PIE, can lean dehydrated\n\n**Mini-review:** Squalane feels very neutral to me. It's a bit heavier than rosehip seed oil, but otherwise I didn't see a huge different in results between squalane, rosehip seed oil, argan oil, borage seed oil, and blue tansy oil. I think squalane's a good starter oil to figure out what your skin likes, and TO's is at a good price point. \n\n********************************************************\n\n**Product Name:** Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG\n\n**Price:** $6.70/30ml\n\n**Skin type and concerns:** DRY, acne-prone, PIE can lean dehydrated, and the relevant concern here is the dark circles under my eyes and hyperpigmentation on my eyelids\n\n**Mini-review:** I don't think this product did much of anything besides moisturizing a bit, which relieves puffiness in and of itself. It stings like a m***** f***** if you get it in your eyes, and it developed a layer of crusty, dried-up product in the neck of the bottle, which made me worry about how well it was preserved. Wouldn't recommend this one. \n\n********************************************************\n\n**Product Name:** 10% Azelaic Acid Suspension\n\n**Price:** $7.90/30ml\n\n**Skin type and concerns:** DRY, acne-prone, PIE, can lean dehydrated\n\n**Mini-review:** This was a major letdown. While looking for something to treat my cystic acne without drying out my skin, a lot of people recommended that I try azelaic acid. I was really excited to try this particular product, but it did *nothing* except for making my sunscreen pill like crazy. I eventually switched to Finacea and started seeing results within a week, which leads me to believe that 10% just isn't a strong enough concentration to handle the type of acne I was dealing with. The pilling also made it very unpleasant to use, and this is my least favourite TO product.\n\n********************************************************\n\n**Product Name:** Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5\n\n**Price:** $6.80/30ml\n\n**Skin type and concerns:** DRY, acne-prone, PIE, can lean dehydrated\n\n**Mini-review:** Another one that did nothing. I felt like I was just putting water on my face. I switched to Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium and have never looked back. I'd recommend just skipping this one and going straight to Hada Labo if you have dry or dehydrated skin. \n\nEdit: I forgot the HA originally",

I can’t offer her review in detail but will say as an adamant low maintenance person who detests multiple step skincare, she does her full routine faithfully at least three days a week.

My skin is SO RIDICULOUSLY soft and clear after using this. I did an in depth review a while ago which I will link. [EDIT! here is the link!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8dp38l/review_the_ordinary_aha_30_bha_2_peeling_solution/?st=JJBLCIGY&sh=3279feb5) I’ve been kind of lazy with my routine for the last month or two and after a few days off I use this to kickstart things and notice a visible difference immediately. Such good stuff!!!\n\n* **[Vitamin C Suspension 23% in Hyaluronic Acid Spheres 2%](https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml?redir=1)**\n\n* **$5.80**\n\n* **Will repurchase** This stuff 10/10 stings. So much so that I have to do my skincare early in the evening before bed on nights I use this because it distracts me from falling asleep. It does sting far more in the cracks of the skin between nose and cheeks, or anywhere the skin isn’t fully dry, or on open abrasions/acne. It also stains the fingers really badly. I did peel around my nose and mouth, but this quickly subsided. I noticed a quick difference in the brightness and evenness of my complexion! I love this product and have come to enjoy the tingling sensation a bit. \n\n* **[Granactive Retinoid 2% in Squalane](https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-granactive-retinoid-2pct-in-squalane-30ml?redir=1) **\n\n* **$9.60**\n\n* **Will repurchase** First Retinoid product I’ve tried and I love it. Adjustment period was very very mild, some tightness and redness with minimal scaling around my nose and mouth at first, but zero burning or irritation. I have noticed a visible difference in the fine lines around my eyes and lips. It actually feels soothing when I apply this, and I’ve taken to applying this simultaneously with the Vitamin C using a brush to neutralize the tingling of the vitamin c. I use this every three days to daily depending on what’s going on with my skin :)\n\n* **[Marine Hyaluronics](https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-marine-hyaluronics-30ml?redir=1)**\n\n* **$6.80**\n\n* **Have repurchased** I go through a lot of this stuff. I use it as a toning step, and really feel the instant hydration. I don’t use it for one to two sessions after the peeling serum, as it seems to make my skin sting a bit. It’s for sure one of the most hydrating steps in my routine and I love it! Even the weird briney smell makes me happy. Mermaid life af.\n\n* **[Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA](https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-natural-moisturizing-factors-ha-100ml?redir=1)**\n\n* **$7.70**\n\n* **Have repurchased** So this isn’t cosmetically elegant. It doesn’t feel super impactful on its own however I do notice a marked difference without it. I do skip my oils when I use this product, as I feel the oils prevent it from pulling atmospheric hydration into my skin as well. But I do enjoy the creamy mousse texture and will keep this in my routine for sure! My skin quite likes it.\n\n*Onto my mom’s routine!!!*\n\n* **[Matrixyl 10% HA](https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-matrixyl-10pct-ha-30ml?redir=1)**\n\n* **$11.50**\n\n* **Doesn’t complain**\n\n* **[Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate 20% in Vitamin F](https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-ascorbyl-tetraisopalmitate-solution-20pct-in-vitamin-f-30ml?redir=1)**\n\n* **$17.80**\n\n* **Doesn’t complain, when empty asked for repurchase**\n\nI took mom from using oil only and Cerave hydrating cleanser to using the Murad Vitamin C Line and a mix of TO, Shiseido, and CosRX products. She even sheet masks once a week now and has given in to wearing sunscreen daily! Signs of aging I could see whenever I’d come home from a semester at school have faded and her skin looks as it did eight years ago. It’s plump, her dryness is nonexistent, her lines are softening and YEARS of sun spots from gardening all day every day have all mostly faded entirely. I’m actually jealous, even though it’s partially my own doing haha\n\nI will say I tried the Squalane oil as well, loved it but now buy cheaper in bulk.",

Although I am prone to eczema on my face & neck, I almost never get eczema flares on the rest of body, and my skin type there is normal.  I only applied this to my arms and legs.\n\n\n- **Mini-review:** I was shocked at how well this worked at addressing KP.  Within a few weeks, it completely obliterated any bumps that I had.  My skin was also very smooth and moisturized (probably helped by the emollient ester \"C12-15 alkyl benzoate\" which feels like a light oil).  This product contains 1&#37; of the retinoic acid ester \"hydroxypinacolone retinoate\", which is also the stuff in the Ordinary's \"granactive retinoid\" products.  The main negative was the fragrance.  It smelled like lemon dishwashing detergent from the limonene / linalool combo, and it had some kind of stink that reminded me of cilantro.  In terms of effectiveness for KP, from most effective to least effective: Retin-Oil > Alpha Skincare 10&#37; glycolic acid body lotion > the Ordinary 7&#37; glycolic acid toner > Amlactin Rapid Relief Restoring Lotion > CeraVe SA renewing lotion\n\n\n- **Ingredients:** C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Algae Extract, Oenocarpus Bataua Fruit Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Oil, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ethoxydiglycol, Parfum (Fragrance), Limonene, Linalool.\n\n\n- **Repurchase?**  Nope, unless the current CEO changes.  But, I'll probably look for a 1&#37; retinol in oil product, and dilute it with a lightweight carrier oil.  During fall/winter, I'll go back to Alpha skincare 10&#37; glycolic lotion.  It's much heavier and I prefer that when it's cooler outside.\n\n**edited for formatting**",

Sensitive. PIH/Melasma.  \n\n**Mini-review** I have used 3/4 of a bottle, started off with 5 drops after my moisturising step 4 times a week for 3 months. Then every night mixed with my serum step till now. At first I had a purge which happened within the first week of use, then after that was absolutely fine. I found it took a while to absorb, but that was more my placement in my routine and how much I used. It has unified my skin tone a little and has slotted in with my other products really well. I notice the PIH from any spots I do get are not as severe. I like it a lot. Have repurchased when I noticed the CEO meltdown. I will be on the look out for other suppliers when the time comes.\n\n**Product Name** EUK134 0.1%\n\n**Price** circa £6.90\n\n**Mini Review** I initially bought this as I want/ed to focus on anti oxidants in my routine and also test to see if Propanidol (at 99.9%) would make my skin react. As it turns out my skin doesn't mind Propanidol. I use 3 - 4 drops every AM after my hydrating DIY toner, as Propanidol is a penetration enhancer and a humectant I feel it helps my toner ingredients to work better and also provide a non oily hydration boost before my moisturising (read rich AF) SS. As for the antioxidant properties, it has the potential to regenerate itself after free radical munching and can work up to 24hrs. So once a day is all that is needed. This is on here say and beyond the hydration properties I can't say this is a wow-look-at-my-skin product. I do like using it though. So I have already repurchased, I have already used nearly a whole bottle. However, I will stop it when I run out to see if there is any benefits that I didn't notice. Stealth benefits as it were. \n\nI also have waiting to trial - Resveratrol 3% + Ferulic Acid 3% , & , Vitamin-C-suspension-30%-in-silicone.... both for the anti oxidant properties. I haven't had much joy with Vitamin C products before, but my skin likes silicones as a last step so this might work for me. \n\nAs a company, I find they make tailored skin care really accessible to someone like me who is on a budget and lives in a country where returns of products because they don't agree with your skin, a no no. I now feel confident I can use >£££ products with these ingredients that my skin would agree with and ethics appear agreeable to me and therefore not waste £40+ a pop . \n\nHaving so many individual vials and steps to apply on my skin is good for testing ingredients, but not long term as too many steps for me can over whelm, therefore I am not likely to use it. Being able to mix with other products, helps.",

    "body": "**TL;DR: Don't fuck up like me. Make sure your moisturizer, primer, and foundation all have the same base or you will regret it.** \n\nOk, I know that this topic has come up a lot recently, but I feel like a lot of discussions leave out a key part of the problem. By now, I think most people know that you have to make sure your primer and foundation have the same base i.e. are they water based or silicone based. It makes sense since those two are layered one on top of the other and if they're immiscible then the foundation will just settle on top and come off on everything, defeating the purpose of a primer. Now, what I haven't seen discussed is how your moisturizer may be interacting with your primer and foundation. I've discovered some interesting things through trial and error recently and wanted to share it with the MUA community.\n\nFirst, I recently switched moisturizers. My skin has been a disaster this winter and I needed a major skincare overhaul. I have sensitive skin and Neutrogena has always had my back with great products that don't irritate my skin. One of the new things I got was a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, the [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/hydro+boost+water+gel.do?sortby=ourPicks). I love this product because it absorbs quickly, eliminated my dry spots, and hasn't caused any irritation. What I didn't take into account when I bought this product was the ingredients list; I was just happy to find a non-irritating hyaluronic acid delivery system. \n\nwater, **dimethicone**, glycerin, **dimeticone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer**, phenoxyethanol, polyacrylamide, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, dimethiconol, C13-14 isoparaffin, **dimethicone crosspolymer**, chlorphenesin, carbomer, laureth-7, sodium hyaluronate, ethylhexylglycerin, fragrance, C12-14 pareth-12, sodium hydroxide, blue 1 \n\nThe bolded ingredients indicate it's a silicone-based primer. Yes, the first ingredient is water, but the silicone is present in large amounts, and it interacts differently with water-based products.\n\nMistake 1: I was going for a low-effort look one day and decided to used some of my face powder and call it good. With face powder I usually wear my [NYX HD Primer](http://www.nyxcosmetics.com/high-definition-primer/NYX_180.html) because it's lighter but still holds the powder in place. That day my makeup was slipping and sliding everywhere and I looked like a cakey hot mess when I got home. I checked the ingredients on my moisturizer, found all the silicone, then looked at the primer ingredients. \n\n**Water/Aqua/Eau,** Propylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Diethylhexyl Maleate, Glycerin, Ethylene/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Dimethicone, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, PEG-15 Glyceryl Isostearate, Trihydroxystearin, Adipic Acid/Neopentyl Glycol Crosspolymer, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Tocopheryl Acetate, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax/Cera Carnauba/Cire de Carnauba, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7, Silica, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin,  Propylene Glycol Stearate, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Laurate, Propylene Glycol Laurate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Butylene Glycol, Salicornia Herbacea Extract, Copper Tripeptide-1,  Chlorphenesin, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, VP/VA Copolymer, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, C12-14 Pareth-7, Amodimethicone,  Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance/Parfum, Citronellol, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. MAY CONTAIN / PEUT CONTENIR (+/-): Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Zinc Oxide (CI 77947), Chromium Hydroxide Green (CI 77289), Ultramarines (CI 77007).\n\nThe water-based primer just sat on top of my moisturizer, making my makeup come off all over everything.\n\nMistake 2: I somehow spaced and forgot all about my moisturizer issues and yesterday I was rushing to leave and decided to just throw on some Sonia Kashuk Radiant Tinted Moisturizer and go. Wrong move. I had already washed my face and moisturized previously, so the Neutrogena moisturizers was under the tinted moisturizer. As I was rubbing the tinted moisturizer on my face, it started to ball up and look disgusting. I quickly wiped it off and left bare faced, but later I looked at the ingredients in the Sonia Kashuk Tinted Moisturizer. \n\nFluorphlogopite, Sorbitan Is Os Tearate,\nTris Iloxane, D Is Teardimonium Hectorite,\nCetyl Peg/Ppg‐10/1 D Imethicone,\nD Imethicone Cros S Polymer, Butylene Glycol,\nSilica D Imethyl Silylate, Synthetic Bees Wax,\nTetras Odium Ed Ta, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium\nChloride, Alcohol, Talc, Peg‐30\nD Ipolyhydroxys Tearate, Aluminum\nHydroxide, Potas S Ium Sorbate, Stearic Acid,\nCaprylyl Methicone, As Corbyl Palmitate,\nTocopherol, Pentaerythrityl Tetra‐Di‐T‐Butyl\nHydroxyhydrocinnamate.\nMay Contain: Mica, Titanium D Ioxide, Iron\nOxides , Zinc Oxide.\n\nThis one is a little more tricky, as it does have some dimethicone ingredients, but my best guess is that the other ingredients react negatively with the ingredients in the Neutrogena moisturizer.\n \nNow, I know this sounds like using the Neutrogena moisturizer is too much of a pain, but it's really not that big of a deal. My favorite primer, the [ELF Poreless Face Primer](http://www.elfcosmetics.com/p/poreless-face-primer?dept=face-faceprimer), works perfectly with this moisturizer and my HG foundation, [Revlon Colorstay Whipped](http://www.revlon.com/products/face/foundation-makeup/revlon-colorstay-whipped-creme-makeup#309971347054||0), goes on better than ever. I just wanted to make this post to inform people that mismatched moisturizer can cause just as many issues as mismatched primer and foundation!",

    "body": "**Skin Type:** dry, sensitive, easily dehydrated; not acne-prone\n\n**Climate:** Dry, Northern California weather\n\n**Ingredients that I found out I’m allergic/sensitive to:** lanolin, nickel, triethanolamine, methylisothiazolinone, chemical sunscreen, macadamia nut oil, and snail ☹ (I can’t believe how sensitive my skin is, considering I don’t even have pollen/food allergies that I know of).\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI ventured into AB last year due to my very dry and dehydrated face. I’ve always had dry skin but when I moved from SoCal to NorCal last year, my face became more dry, itchy, and flaky especially when the weather got colder. I loved the sun in SoCal and never used sunscreen on my face (I know it’s bad). I also did not care much about my face and only used water or shower gel for cleansing after using make up remover wipes. I also did not use lotion/moisturizers.\n\nIn the past months of trying out products and reading this subreddit, I have learned so much and realized the importance of low pH cleansers, patch testing, moisturizing, etc. Despite dealing with contact dermatitis a couple times and more whiteheads or pimples than before, and having to restart my routine again and again, I am enjoying this trial and error process.\nHere are some mini-reviews of the products I’ve used so far. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Current Products:**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Epielle Facial Cleansing tissues** – I have been using this make up remover wipes for years without realizing that it is made in Korea. It works well with removing most of my waterproof eyeliner before I wash my face. The one in white packaging does not contain alcohol and sodium laureth sulfate. It has cucumber extract, green tea extract, and aloe vera extract, but I think that gets washed off anyways. I use it because it is cheap ($1-$1.50) and it is easily available in Big Lots, Grocery Outlet, and online. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Innisfree The Minimum Cleansing Lotion** – This is my current first cleanser. I put it in cotton pads and soak my eyeliner with it. It easily removes the remaining eyeliner residue without making my eyes burn. It leaves an oily feel on my skin, so I use a second cleanser after this. It is great for sensitive and dry skin since it is alcohol and sulfate-free, but it has cetearyl alcohol, which some people are sensitive to.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Cow Brand Gyunyu Non-Additive Cleansing Milk** – This cleansing milk is advertised as a make up remover that contains natural palm oil and olive squalene. It is alcohol-free, sulfate-free, and fragrance-free. It is non-foaming and very gentle. It feels “silky” on my skin but does not leave an oily feel. However, it does not easily remove my eyeliner (and that’s why I use make up remover wipes first). This also works as a morning/second cleanser and that’s how I prefer to use it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Innisfree Jeju Bija Anti-Trouble Cleansing Gel** – I have only been testing this cleanser for 2 weeks and so far, I haven’t noticed any problems from it. I use this as a second cleanser after Innisfree the minimum cleansing lotion. My face does not feel dry or stripped of oil after using this. It does have a strong “pine-like” smell if you are sensitive to fragrances. Is this really discontinued or not?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Kikumasamune High Moist Lotion** – This watery toner smells like sake at first but that smell dissipates quickly (I actually like that sake smell). This is my first ferment product and my skin seems to like it. My skin just seems to absorb the product easily. I use 3-5 layers of this depending on how lazy I am. The ceramides in it must have helped my skin recover post contact dermatitis from Rosette ceramide gel and Cosrx snail cream. It was amazing to see my skin change from dry, red, flaky and itchy to smooth, moisturized skin. As you know, it comes in such a huge bottle so you get so much of the product for the price. The pump on the bottle sucks, so I put it on a spray bottle. I use it on my body too and my legs are no longer flaky this winter. I also just started using this on my scalp after washing my hair as suggested by some on this subreddit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**COSRX Oil-Free Ultra Moisturizing Lotion with Birch Sap** – I actually suggested this to my boyfriend who has oily skin and hates using spatula for moisturizers. He loved it! I tried it because I did not have another moisturizer after dealing with contact dermatitis. Thankfully, it is gentle and did not cause burning on my dry, dehydrated, red skin. This and the Kikumasamune high moist lotion helped my face recover and my flaking itchy skin is gone. It is also not as light as I thought because it really keeps my skin moisturized for several hours. I’ve only been using this for 2 weeks, so I’m still keeping an eye for possible breakout from cetearyl alcohol (I haven’t used much products with it) but so far so good. Take note that it is not entirely oil-free. It has lemon peel oil and tea tree leaf oil at the end of its ingredient list (most likely in small amounts).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**COSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch and Nexcare 3M Acne dressing** – These pimple patches just work so well! I love seeing how it absorbs the pus out of pimples and whiteheads. Cosrx is more expensive than Nexcare 3M but I think they are both very similar and effective.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Beauty Treats face masks** – I got these sheet masks from Daiso for $1.50 each. These masks have no alcohol, parabens, or fragrance and have minimal ingredients. These are soaked with essence, fit well on my face, and very soothing. Honestly, I think there’s not much difference between the different masks of this brand. The ingredients are mostly similar – all of them have hyaluronic acid, arbutin, cucumber extract, green tea extract, aloe vera extract and vitamin E. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**[non-AB] H&B Oils Center 100% unrefined, cold pressed rice bran oil** – I bought this to make sure that I am not going to have a bad skin reaction from rice bran oil since I want to buy the Kuramoto Bijin rice bran oil. So far, I am using this on my scalp and hair after washing my hair. This helps the ends of my hair look silky and less dry.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Products I will not repurchase:**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n•\t**Cure Natural Aqua Gel** - My very first AB product purchase since my first visit in Japan. I wanted to see if it really removes dead skin or if it was just a gimmick. Turned out that it was just a waste of money and I finally stopped using it after realizing that it makes my skin dry and itchy afterwards. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Cleansing Foam** – This was my first AB cleanser without enough research. My face felt so dry and stripped after my first use and I immediately stopped it. I later found out that it is a high pH cleanser. Everyone should definitely avoid this product.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Mizon Water Volume EX first essence** – I bought this without knowing what a first essence really is. It is a watery essence and it feels refreshing when you pat it on your face. It did not really cause me any problems but I stopped using this because I don’t think it was really doing anything for my skin.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Secret Key Aloe Soothin Moist Toner** – I thought this was going to be a gentle toner since it really felt like water. It did not feel refreshing, soothing, or moisturizing. It was just like tap water. I stopped using this when I started having mild itching every time I used it. I later found out that it contained snail secretion filtrate, which my skin is allergic to.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Dear by Enprani Moistfull Booskin** – I am so glad that I did not buy the full size of this toner (which is huge!). It contains so much plant extracts that I don’t even know what my skin reacted to. I only patch tested it for a week but it caused my skin to have red bumps, itching, and whiteheads. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Lotion** – This passed my patch testing but when I used it on my full face after 1 week, my face was the most dehydrated it had ever been. I used this on damp face and layered a moisturizer on it but it gave me whiteheads, dry, flaky, and itchy skin. I’m guessing my dry skin did not like the amount of hyaluronic acid in this. I was very disappointed that it didn’t work for me since a lot of people rave about it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**O Hui Miracle Moisture Skin Softener moist** – This hydrating toner was actually amazing. I found out through this product that my face loves ceramides. It made my skin smooth and bouncy, but it is pricier than other toners with ceramides, highly fragranced (like a strong perfume, which I don’t like), and I found out that denatured alcohol was 3rd on its ingredient list. If you don’t mind its price and fragrance, I think it is a good hydrating toner for dry skin.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Etude House Moistfull Collagen Emulsion** – This was the first AB moisturizer I bought because it was highly recommended by Sokoglam. It actually made my face moisturized, my face felt smooth and did not have flaking. However, something in this emulsion was causing me multiple whiteheads around my lips and on my chin (possibly hydrogenated vegetable oil, alcohol, or fragrance?). It also smelled too “perfumey” and there are so much more better AB moisturizers that I wanted to try.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**O Hui Miracle Moisture Emulsion** – Something in this product caused my face to feel like it was burning and made my skin flushed whenever I used it. It also left me with dry, itchy skin on the few days I used it. Unfortunately, I cannot find its ingredients anywhere.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Mizon Water Volume EX cream** – This is a blue colored gel moisturizer instead of a “cream” consistency. It was refreshing to use and felt “cool” on my face. It did not provide me with enough hydration though. By mid-day, my face was already dry again and craving for some moisture. I gave it to my boyfriend who has oily face and he liked it as a day moisturizer. It has high alcohol content, so it is probably not good for people with dehydrated skin. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Rosette Ceramide Gel** – This gel felt sticky when I applied it on my face but absorbed after 5-10 minutes. You don’t need to apply a lot of product for your whole face and neck. It initially made my face feel smooth and nicely moisturized. After almost 2 weeks of using this, I thought I already have my HG moisturizer. Then, I noticed that my jaw got itchy. I ignored it, and then my forehead got itchy. The more times I used it, my face got increasingly itchy, but I was in denial that it was the culprit. “My face loves ceramides, so it can’t be this!” Until, I applied it once more and my face got red and itchy just a few minutes after. I developed contact dermatitis possibly from the macadamia nut oil in it. My face was red, flaky, and dehydrated and I was so devastated because this gel has so much ceramides and I love its packaging. YMMV for sure.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**COSRX Advanced Snail 92 All in One cream** – I was hesitant to use snail products because I was worried that I am allergic to it. Despite not knowing if I am allergic to dust mites, I just had a feeling that my skin won’t like snail but everyone raves about snail! So, I bought this and applied it on my right cheek. This is like a thick gel that has a slimy texture. A little amount goes a long way. My face absorbed the product easily too and I was really hoping that this would work for me. After one day, my nose felt very dry and I felt like I’m going to have a cold. I thought it was weird because I spent the past few days at home and was not exposed to anyone who was sick. The next day, I have full on runny nose. Four days later, I still had a runny nose (with clear drainage which is unlike a common cold where you get yellow snot – sorry if this grosses you out) and I had red bumps, redness, and itching on my right cheek after applying cosrx snail cream. I stopped using it immediately and felt relief from Benadryl cream. My “cold” also miraculously disappeared after I stopped using it. Well, looks like no more snail products for me ☹\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Shiseido Senka Aging Care UV sunscreen** - The first day I used it, at the end of the day, my face felt dry and it already gave me red bumps on my cheek, where I don’t usually get pimples. Those red bumps disappeared the next day when I stopped using the sunscreen, so they were not even pimples. This sunscreen actually felt nice to apply on my face though and dried matte, but I honestly won’t try it again.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Canmake Mermaid UV gel** – I thought I’d give an alcohol-free sunscreen a try thinking that maybe the high alcohol content in Shiseido Senka sunscreen made me dry and broke me out. This did not feel oily on skin and also dried matte. There was a very slight white cast but not that noticeable on my skin. On day 2 of patch testing it, my cheek had red bumps that did not look like pimples. These bumps also disappeared as soon as I stopped using this. So, I think I might be sensitive to chemical sunscreen. The search for a face sunscreen continues.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Products I look forward to testing:**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Matsuyama Hydrating Toner** – It contains 5 types of CERAMIDES! and fermented soybean! I got this from Amazon global japan and I just started patch testing it. It is watery but has a thin slimy feel to it. So far, my left cheek is feeling very smooth without flaking, even without a moisturizer on top of it. I really like its packaging too. It comes in a nice glass bottle that makes it feel more expensive than how much I paid for it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Innisfree Perfect UV protection triple care cream** – This sunscreen only has physical filters. This just arrived so I haven’t tested it on my face yet. Luckily, I work night shifts and rarely go out during the day so I can avoid the sun for now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Kuramoto Bijin Hakumai Ferment Milk** – I have only seen good reviews on this emulsion and I just truly hope this works for me. To be honest, I really want this not only because of the sake ferments but also because of the sake bottle packaging.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Kuramoto Bijin Lotion** – I read that this is a better sake toner than the Kikumasamune high moist lotion, so I can’t wait to try it.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Kuramoto Bijin Komeyu Rice Bran Oil** – 100% cold pressed rice bran oil from a Japanese brewery. I haven’t used other oils on my face but I read that rice bran oil is an occlusive. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Kuramoto Bijin Komeyu Serum** – I haven’t really tried any other serums but heard good things about this beauty serum. If it will keep my face from getting dry, then I’m all for it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**COSRX Ultimate Nourishing Rice Overnight Spa Mask** – I obviously just want to try more rice beauty products right now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Matsuyama Cleansing Gel** – This is a first cleanser with minimal ingredients and contains soy extract and hydrolyzed soy protein. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Muji seaweed shampoo and conditioner** – Well, since I love Japanese products so much, I might as well try a Japanese sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. I will have to drive 1 hour to get to the nearest Muji, but I will definitely get this. ",

    "body": "Hiya! First time posting here, so be gentle. \nMy scalp used to be very oily and my ends very dry. I dye and trim my hair once a month, and after using this routine my hair has gone from this greasy and dry mess to looking and feeling like \"virgin hair\" AKA like I've never dyed it or done anything to it. And I gotta say it's a pretty awesome feeling.\nThis is a really long post as I'm listing all of my products I use, so if you're not into long posts I'm sowwy :(\n\nLiving Libations Seabuckthorn Shampoo & Shine on Conditioner: The bom.com. My hair doesn't get greasy until the fourth day (I was my hair every four days during the winter and every three days during the summer). These are perfect for winter. It's not that I can't use them in the summer, I absolutely can. But my hair gets sweaty and gross during the summer (NOT greasy. SWEATY.) and while these guys would do an awesome job either way, I prefer a more tingly and minty shampoo which I will talk about now!\n\nGreen Beaver Fresh Mint Shampoo & Conditioner: Now that's what I'm talking about! These are perfect for summer. They're minty, tingly and makes my scalp in particular feel extremely comfortable. They're not as hydrating and moisturizing, but during the summer I want quite a light hydration instead of heavy duty stuff.\n\nDIY Hair Oil: Yup, I made myself some hair oil. I use a mixture of macadamia nut oil, jojoba oil and avocado oil. I take one-two pumps (I have it in a little travel bottle with a pump) and apply it to my ends. I also have a single bottle of jojoba oil that I just run through my lengths (avoiding my roots) as it's moisturizing but not too greasy.\n\nDIY Detangler: I am soooo overkilling it with hydration, slip and softness at this point. But I love it. I made this detangler myself aswell. I used water, slippery elm and marshmallow root and put it into a little spray bottle. Marshmallow root and slippery elm become gelatinous when submerged in water which is why I spray this on my hair when it's wet; and it seriously makes my hair feel like silk.\n\nMorrocanoil Heat Styling Protection: This is where my conventional products come in. I personally think that hairsprays and heat protection from natural and organic companies just doesn't work (for me atleast). This one is really nice, and I haven't found that my hair feels or looks fried after using my hair dryer or hair straightener with this stuff. So I guess it's doing its job!\n\nMorrocanoil Luminous Hairspray Strong Hold: This smells yummy as hell. It sets my hair perfectly without making it crispy and crunchy (because that aint cute). Allows for hands to glide through the hair but still offers that reliable strong hold. Love it!\n\nLUSH No Drought: This is a versatile product. Or, well, not really - I use it for two things so is that versatile? Anyway, I use it as a dry shampoo and styling powder. Even though my hair looks and feels amazing, it can get a bit flat as its so nourished and moisturized that it needs a little help in the volume department. I take a little of this and apply it to my roots, let it sit for a couple of minutes to soak up any overflow of oil and then I just shake my hair around with my fingers to get the access off. So it acts as a volumizing powder and dry shampoo in one!\n\nLUSH Hair Doctor: For hair masks I use different techniques. Overnight, pre-shampoo and post-shampoo. This one falls into the pre-shampoo category. I apply it to my roots only and let it sit there for around 30 minutes. Then I jump into the shower and wash my hair as usual. This one is fantastic during the summer when I need an extra bit of detox for my scalp. \n\nPhilip Kinglsey Elasticizer: This is another pre-shampoo mask. This one I just slather on every inch of hair and leave it on for 30 minutes up to an hour if I have time. Wash it out in the shower and it leaves it feeling healthy. Hard to describe but it seems to just solve any emergency problems I might have.\n\nMoroccanoil Restorative Hair Mask: This is your standard hair mask you apply after shampooing and leave on for a couple of minutes and then rinse off. What can I say? I love it. It's great. Makes your hair looks good. Smells great.\n\nNutiva Organic Virgin Coconut Oil: This is my overnight treatment. I apply a thick layer to my hair, through it up in a quick bun and throw on a slap (will be mentioned further down). The day after I rinse it out, shampoo and condition as usual and voila. Perfect hair day everytime.\n\nGrace Eleyae Satin Lined Slap: This is basically a beanie with silk interior. It has an elastic band so it wont slip off your head while wearing it. Easiest way to describe how these work: You know those gloves you can put on after handcream that will kinda seal in the moisture and such? This is that for you hair.\n\nHH Simonsen Wet Brush: The first thing I use after I come out the shower. A quick brush to just make sure that the hair is smooth.\n\nConair Anti-static Detangling Comb: Just a regular wide tooth comb that I just go through my hair with after applying my detangling spray. Nothing special.\n\nEcoTools Styler & Smoother Agility Hairbrush: I can't do round brushing for my life. This is rounded, but flat on the back. I use when I blowdry my hair and it works great for that.\n\nDenman Medium Cushion Brush: After I'm done with blowdrying, I brush it out with this. Also after straightening it and when I've applied hairspray to make sure that everything looks relaxed.\n\nMetal Clips: I get these from my local beauty supply store. Just inexpensive metal clips that help me section my hair.\n\nBLAX Snag-Free Hair Elastics: These are great. They don't kink the hair, are gentle and if you take them off and leave them for an hour or so they seem to 'shrink' back to their original size which means that they don't get too big and useless.\n\nParlux 385 Power Light: My blowdryer. I used to use the GHD Air (which by the way, is not worth the money in my opinion. You pay for the name and not the quality. It's bulky, loud, gets waaaay too hot and is just average.) but this one is perfect. Quality, lightweight and it's pink. I'm not a pink girl but even I think this looks fabulous.\n\nGA.MA CP1 Ceramic Straightener: This is really inexpensive considering the results you get. I only have to over my hair twice at most (and that's only if I want a really sleek look instead of usual straight-but-messy look). I love it!\n\nAnd that's it! It looks like a lot, but it doesn't take me long to do any of this and it feels like it's worth it for sure. \n",

    "body": "On July 8, 2016, Differin .1% Gel was approved by the FDA for over-the-counter sale. This is a big deal in the treatment and management of [mild-to-moderate acne](https://skinolog.ist/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img008.jpg) at home, as it is the only prescription strength retinoid available in every major drugstore (and Amazon!) in the US. Bonus: it's cheaper than most people's co-pays (including mine) used to be. Unfortunately, it's still kind of a mystery on how to use it properly for your skin, as there is a ton of misinformation out there on the world wide web and the tube basically tells you to just use it every day after washing your face. \n\n* * *\n\n##General Retinoid Tips\n\n[In my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/92hhpw/misc_skincare_ingredients_tretinoin_adapalene_and/), I talked a bit about the different types of retinoids available as well as some brief usage tips. In short:\n\n*   Wear SPF 30-50 every day while using any topical retinoid, including Differin.\n*   Avoid the eye area (lid and thin undereye) as well as the lips and areas next to the nasal passages.\n*   Apply a pea-sized amount. Dr. Dray demonstrates this amount in her video. It is quite literally roughly the size of a pea.\n*   Apply after cleansing and moisturizing your skin, once your moisturizer has dried down. Don't use overly occlusive moisturizers before Differin application, like heavy oils.\n*   Do not introduce new products right before or while using Differin. The reason for this is that if you begin to break out from the new product, it can be misinterpreted as breaking out from the Differin.\n*   Retinoids are not pregnancy safe. Please speak with your doctor if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant before using Differin or any topical retinoid, including retinol.\n\n[If you do best by watching videos, Dr. Dray has an excellent video on this process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF0Sw_wVqgs). \n\n* * *\n\n##Starting Differin\n\n\nWhen you first start using Differin, you'll want to ween your skin into it. While some skin is very tolerant and can withstand every night almost immediately, for more sensitive skin types this can be a bit more of a process. I've written some general guidelines below, but please note that all skin is different so you may need to tweak this depending on your own skin.\n\n*   **Tolerant Skin. **If your skin is quite tolerant of topical therapies and rarely shows signs of irritation and peeling, feel free to begin applying a pea-sized amount of  Differin once a day, at night, after cleansing and applied over your moisturizer as Dr. Dray demonstrates above. If your skin begins to feel tender or like it is burning, even after application of a bland moisturizer, cut down to usage every other day.\n*   **Normal/Sensitive Skin. **If your skin is sensitive or relatively normal, apply a pea-sized amount of Differin every other night (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, etc.), after cleansing and applied over your moisturizer, as demonstrated above. If your skin begins to feel tender, even after application of a bland moisturizer, cut down to every third night.\n*   **Very Sensitive Skin. **If your skin frequently shows signs of irritation to new products, particularly things like AHA, BHA, or vitamin C serums, or if you have rosacea, you may want to start by applying a pea-sized amount, over moisturized, clean skin every third night. This is where I started. After a few weeks, your skin should be able to tolerate every other night without excessive burning, tenderness, or peeling. If it does, cut back to every third night.\n\nIf your skin starts to feel a-okay with every third night or even every other night, try to bump up frequency. The goal is to be able to use it every night, but if your skin never feels comfortable at that point, that is okay - use it as frequently as you can. Remember that for everything, everyone's skin is different and beautiful. Your mileage may vary.\n\nWhat to Expect\n------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Some tenderness.**My skin is more sensitive to being scratched, hot water, scruffy beards, and chemical filter sunscreens, particularly sunscreens with avobenzone.\n*   **Micro-peels.** Wearing makeup will be a challenge during the adjustment period (about two months) of using Differin. Your skin will look and feel smooth, but application of foundation will show very fine peeling all over the skin. *This is okay and normal.* If your skin is ever showing thick \"sheets\" of peeling, you should back down on usage. *Your skin should not be shedding like a snake from Differin .1%*\n*   **Slightly more breakouts.** Experiencing slightly more breakouts for the first few weeks is normal and fine. They should not be extremely aggressive or much worse than the breakouts you were experiencing before, particularly if your acne is mild.\n*   **Dryness.** Dryness is very typical with any retinoid product, particularly during the first 4 weeks. Apply more moisturizer than usual and more frequently throughout the day, if needed. Do not use occlusives like Vaseline on your skin before applying Differin, as this can inhibit some of the absorption of Differin.\n\n* * *\n\n##Combining Therapies at Home\n\n\n[Referring back to my post I made previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/92hhpw/misc_skincare_ingredients_tretinoin_adapalene_and/) once again, all retinoids (and frankly, all acne treatments) are best when used as a combination therapy all over the affected area (in this case, the face).\n\nBenzoyl Peroxide (BP)\n------------------------------------------------\n\nBP is not a new drug. First shown to be effective against acne in 1934 (though not explored as a treatment for acne until the 1960s when William Pace began to treat patients with a precipitated sulphur cream that contained BP), it is now often prescribed as a treatment for mild-to-moderate acne in conjunction with topical retinoids, particularly adapalene (Differin). The FDA has permitted use of benzoyl peroxide in OTC concentrations of 2.5-10%. \n\n[Details of randomised, double blind clinical studies using BP for the treatment of acne](https://skinolog.ist/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BP_studies.jpg).\n\nIt has keratolytic, moderate comedolytic, and antibacterial properties, \"which include the reduction of *P. acnes* and *Staphylococcus aureus* on skin.\"¹ It is a largely vehicle-dependent drug, meaning that the formulation matters. One journal notes this: \"Many formulations incorporate BP crystals that vary in size and do not necessarily fully dissolve completely or at the same rate. Larger crystals that are not capable of settling into the follicular ostia due to their size may randomly rest on the skin surface for more prolongued periods of time, thus producing scattered foci of 'hot spots' that may present as patches of cutaneous irritation.\"¹ \n\nIn addition, in three double-blind studies 2.5% BP gel was been found to be just as effective as 5% and 10% preparations with fewer side effects due to the lower concentration of the drug. \n\nTo combine with Differin at home, I recommend finding it in a wash, such as PanOxyl, or Differin's brand \"Daily Deep\" Cleanser, which contains 5% Benzoyl Peroxide. Feel free to use BP in this form twice a week or every other night - whichever you and your skin are most comfortable with. This is a form of short-contact therapy (an effective way to use benzoyl peroxide with less side effects) that can also be done with gels or creams as well, especially if cleansers are too drying for your skin. In one study on short-contact therapy:\n\n> *Short contact therapy utilizing a 2 minute skin contact time with BP 9.8% emollient foam used once daily over a 2 week duration was highly effective in reducing the quantity of P acnes organisms on the back and provided comparable colony count reduction to \"leave on\" therapy using BP 5.3% emollient foam. ([Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22777224))*\n\nFor gels or creams, I sound like a broken record about this brand, but I do genuinely love Paula's Choice BPO formulations. I have a small, travel-sized tube of their 5% formulation (which is not more efficacious than their 2.5%, but I had to test it!) and I love it. Unlike most BP formulations that crust up and sit as a film on the skin, the PC BP spreads easily and sinks in. Acne.org also has a pretty wonderful formulation of 2.5% BP that I used many years ago. \n\nAn additional note about BP is that is must be used *all over* to be effective as a combination treatment. While it is frequently billed a spot treatment product, BP really shines when it is allowed to treat acne *before* it becomes a problem, by blasting *P. acnes* and unseen microcomedones. This is why infrequent short-contact therapy is ideal, as the whole face can become quite sensitized when you're new to Differin. \n\nTo use a cream or gel as short contact therapy, use it over your moisturizer, before washing your face. If this bothers you, wash your face very gently first, removing any makeup or sunscreen, and patting dry with a towel. Apply a thin layer all over, let sit for two minutes, and rinse away. Apply your moisturizer while skin is still damp to prevent TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss) and let dry completely before applying a thin layer of Differin (about 20 minutes, if you are using it on the same day you use Differin). \n\nTo use a benzoyl peroxide cleanser, follow the instructions on the bottle, after removing any sunscreen and makeup with an oil-cleanser. Apply your moisturizer immediately after, while skin is still damp, to prevent TEWL and let dry completely before applying a thin layer of Differin. \n\nIf your skin feels particularly raw, painful, or chapped from the introduction of BP, cut down on frequency, use it on the \"rest\" day that you aren't using Differin, or remove it all together to let your skin heal before re-introducing. *Please note that these instructions are not for use with Duac, a prescription topical combining clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide*.\n\nSalicylic Acid (BHA)\n------------------------------------------------\n\nSalicylic acid (SA) is in a class of ingredients known as hydroxy acids, which I've referenced before. SA is a lipophilic (oil-friendly, meaning it is ideal for oilier skin types or in conjunction with oily products) compound and found in a plethora of products. While frequently considered as the oil-friendly version of AHA, it differs from AHAs in how it exfoliates the skin (desquamation, keratolytic) as well as it's ability to prevent the formation of comedones (comedolytic). To quote a journal that overviews the many OTC treatments for acne:\n\n> **[On AHA]** *At lower concentrations, AHA functions as an exfoliant, interrupting corneocyte adhesion in the upper SC by interfering with formation of ionic bonds. As a result, AHAs promote individual corneocyte desquamation and decrease corneocyte clumping, both of which lead to smoother skin texture and decreased visible scaling and flaking; a decrease in follicular hyperkeratois promotes resolution and prevents formation of AV lesions, especially comedones. ...* \n\n>**[On BHA/SA]** *Due to its desmolytic properties, salicylic acid promotes individual corneocyte desquamation, thus simulating natural exfoliation, and exerts moderate comedolytic activity. The desmolytic and comedolytic properties of salicylic acid are concentration-dependent. In fact, salicylic acid is not keratolytic. Rather, it exerts its effect on SC desquamation by breaking the bonds created by corneodesmosomes, also called the “rivets” or “staples” of the SC, which sustain the adherence between contiguous corneocytes. ... The “physiological” desquamation provided by salicylic acid provides smoother texture and appearance to the skin and can give the illusion of decreased pore sizes.*\n\nThe journal goes on to add: \"Unfortunately, lower concentrations of salicylic acid may provide only a modest desmolytic [the process of breaking down carbon-to-carbon double bonds, such as between skin cells] activity, thus producing minimal therapeutic effects.\" In shorter terms, your mileage may vary. Some people find great success with BHAs while others feel like it does very little for them.\n\nOver the counter formulations can appear in 0.05% to 5%, while higher concentrations of SA are reserved for prescriptions and chemical peels. \n\nThese features make it less ideal (and much less studied) than BP for combination therapy with Differin, especially in lower percentages or untested formulations, but for some it may prove useful or even better than BP. \n\nTo use it with Differin, look for unscented washes or leave-on applications and use on clean, moisturized skin, before applying Differin or every-other-night, when not using Differin. Many people like Stridex pads due to their wide availability, but the formulation can be irritating to some. My personal favorite is (again - I swear I am not sponsored, I just really love their active ingredients) Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid (Extra Strength, if using her acne line). CosRX also has a couple products, if you prefer Asian beauty products. \n\nFor cleansers, there are fewer options. Clinique has one that is fairly pricey and Dr. Dray loves the classic orange, oil-free Neutrogena cleanser in the pump (not the bar!). Use after removing makeup, following the directions on the bottle, and immediately apply your moisturizer to prevent TEWL. Once dry, apply a thin layer of Differin. \n\nThe risks with BHA combination therapy are largely the same as BP - redness, dryness, tenderness. If you begin to feel any of these effects, cut down on the frequency of usage of BHA before cutting back on Differin. If needed, remove the BHA entirely until your skin heals.\n\nGlycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid (AHAs)\n------------------------------------------------\n\nAHAs or Alpha Hydroxy Acids are a group of products that include glycolic, lactic, mandelic, and fruit acids. While the exact mechanism of these ingredients is rather poorly understood, it is known that they exert some effect by thinning the stratum corneum (SC) - the upper most layer of the epidermis - as well as dispersing basal layer melanin and increasing collagen synthesis in higher concentrations. \n\nAs mentioned above, AHAs can be helpful for some conditions of hyperkeratinization where the epidermal thickening impairs the SC permeability, resulting in skin fissures (microfissuring and macrofissuring). The most extreme examples of macrofissuring is usually seen on hands or feet, where the skin may split or \"fissure.\" At low concentrations (below 8%), AHAs disrupt the corneocyte adhesion. To re-iterate from above:\n\n>*At lower concentrations, AHA functions as an exfoliant, interrupting corneocyte adhesion in the upper SC by interfering with formation of ionic bonds. As a result, AHAs promote individual corneocyte desquamation and decrease corneocyte clumping, both of which lead to smoother skin texture and decreased visible scaling and flaking; a decrease in follicular hyperkeratois promotes resolution and prevents formation of AV lesions, especially comedones. Higher concentrations of AHAs (8-10%) can lead to both epidermolysis and thickening of the dermis.*\n\nFor some, this action can prove helpful when used in conjunction with retinoids, which most frequently cause peeling and dryness. \n\nTo use with Differin, look for low percentages to start with (4-8%) in leave-on products. Glycolic, while the most effective form of AHA, is quite irritating to some skin types due to it's ability to work quickly. Mandelic and lactic acid are especially gentle forms of AHAs due to their larger molecules that penetrate slower and may allow some people to use AHAs when they otherwise wouldn't be able to. \n\nTo start, add them to your routine on your off-nights and work up tolerability from there. Some people also find value in using short-contact therapy with AHAs - particularly glycolic - though this limits their efficacy, particularly with forms that penetrate much slower, such as mandelic acid. Some popular brands of AHAs are Paula's Choice (8% Glycolic Gel), Pixi Glow Tonic (note: this contains several plant extracts, which can be very irritating), Nip + Fab pads (also contain fragrance and plant extracts), The Ordinary (7% Glycolic Solution as well as 10% Lactic), Stratia (10% Mandelic), and as CosRX (Glycolic Acid). \n\nIt is not advised to use an AHA in a cleanser, as it is often not on the skin long enough to create noticeable differences.\n\nAs with all of the other above combinations, if you begin to experience redness, soreness, dryness, or irritation, cut down frequency and remove entirely if needed to allow your skin to heal.\n\n\nAzelaic Acid (AzA)\n------------------------------------------------\n\nA natural component of everyone's skin, azelaic acid (AzA) is also a viable combination therapy, and there are increasingly more products available over-the-counter that contain this ingredient. While AzA is not frequently prescribed for acne, it can be very helpful for some skin types, particularly those that are very sensitive. \n\nUnfortunately, there are no good studies around AzA when used with Differin, but there are studies around AzA in comparison to clindamycin and BP. Specifically, one study showed it to be as effective as 5% BP as well as 1% clindamycin in a randomized controlled study with 351 patients (BP gel) and 229 patients (clindamycin).\n\n> *Azelaic acid 15% gel proved to be as effective as BPO and clindamycin with median % reduction of the inflamed lesion (papules and pustules) of 70%, and 71% respectively. The azelaic acid gel was well-tolerated, the side effects (local burning and irritation) were distinctly less than with BPO but more pronounced than with clindamycin. Despite these side effects, the treatment was well-accepted by the majority of patients. (Abstract, [source](http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/16281587))*\n\nAzA is also bacteriostatic, meaning that it can suppress the ability for bacteria to reproduce, which can help inflammation. It also suppresses hyper-proliferation of keratin, which is a factor in acne. \n\nUnfortunately, it does take time to work and the side-effects when initially starting off can be aggravating. The most common side-effects are itching and stinging as well as mild dryness or peeling. This tends to resolve within 4 weeks. This can be difficult to push through. As someone who uses AzA, I can say that the initial itching upon application canfeel very intense and aggravating to deal with, though icing my skin helped me push through the worst days. Your mileage may vary.\n\nTo use AzA with Differin, I recommend trying to use it in your “off” nights, when not using Differin. If your skin tolerates this fine, feel free to use it every night. AzA is typically pretty gentle, but the itching can feel *very* intense if you have never used it before, especially when used on sensitive skin or skin that is sensitized from other ingredients.\n\nThere are a few trustworthy AzA topicals available over-the-counter in the US. Paula’s Choice makes one that contains 10% AzA and 2% BHA, which I reviewed. The Ordinary also makes a 10% AzA, though it feels quite powdery and silicone-y, which some people dislike. Garden of Wisdom is another option, especially for people sensitive to many ingredients. Their product is an 8% serum that receives a lot of love, though I have never used it myself.\n\nAnother option is Melazepam Cream (20% AzA). However, I want to mention that this formula contains two oils, which may inhibit some of it’s efficacy. Specifically, in a study involving 15% AzA, waiting until after moisturizing seemed to result in greater penetration of AzA in all moisturizers tested except for one, which contained an oil (macadamia nut oil). It was surmised that this was due to the occlusivity of the oil. Another potential issue is that Melazepam is made in Israel – something that may concern some consumers.\n\nIf you feel irritation or the itching is incredibly intense, try to back down on usage. I have found that applying a cool ice pack (wrapped in a towel so you aren't pressing such an extreme cold to your skin) can really help soothe some of the \"itch.\"\n\nSulfur\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTopical sulfur is another option, though hard to find and frequently found in masks and other short-contact products. Sulfur exhibits antimicrobial properties and has been used for hundreds of years to treat AV as well as seborrheic dermatitis. It is frequently found in formulas up to 10% in combination with other products, particularly resorcinol, which is thought to be antibacterial, antifungal, and keratolytic.\n\nUnfortunately, topical sulfur frequently causes mild irritation and sensitization, and has limited popularity.\n\nQueen Helene’s Mint Julep Mask is a popular product with sulfur, as well as the ProActiv mask. I would advise anyone using the Mint Julep Mask in particular with Differin to be cautious, as the clay (kaolin) can be very drying to skin that is already dry and peeling, and the fragrance content is fairly high, making it a potentially extremely irritating choice of treatment.\n\n---\n\nWhatever you decide, it is important to be consistent and not treat either the Differin or the combination product as a spot treatment. While this is a popular way to avoid irritation and sensitization, it only treats the symptom, not the disease, which is to say that it is only treating the comedone once it has surfaced as a larger issue rather than treating the root of the problem: the formation of microcomedones. Differin takes roughly twelve weeks to see full results, and products like AzA can take even longer. Whatever you decide, stick with it and listen to your skin by backomg off when it feels a bit more sensitive and moving up slowly in application when you feel you're adjusting.\n\n---\n\n##Sources\n\n\n1.

        "body": "I'm having great success with Differin,  and just wanted to add that for sensitive skin or even resilient skin,  contact therapy with Differin is very effective.   Because Differin travels so easily to other areas of skin where you don't really want it to go,  it sucks having to choose between using Differin and nothing else,  or doing a full night routine with all your delicious products.   I'll usually oil cleanse or use micellar water to get a clean base,  apply Differin and leave on for at least an hour,  then use my second cleanser to completely remove the Differin,  and proceed with my normal nightly routine.   It can be time intensive if you start before bed,  but if you start when you get home from work and take off your makeup,  you give Differin plenty of time to work until it's time for the bed time routine. \n\nSince using Differin I've actually given up all other acids because I don't need them,  except for alpha lipoic acid,  which I use twice a week on nights I take a break from Differin.   Differin did amazing work clearing my skin, minimizing my pores,  and sloughing dead skin,  so I don't feel super compelled to take unnecessary risks using BHAs or AHAs or volatile l-ascorbic acid forms of vitamin c.   \n\nIt's pretty mind-blowing to me that after all these years,  a product that easily clears my skin is available over the counter at such a low price.   I'd have a LOT less scarring if this had come out 20 years ago,  but I'm too grateful for it to complain.   \n\nJust know that there are a lot of ways to use Differin to get it to work for you,  and it does not need to be left on overnight to work.   You also don't need to cram your night routine into your morning to get all the good things on your face.",

I much prefer it made into banchan to get rid of that hairiness.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w2aipuxqvd731.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=61e9efff503be8fb28c0d10f06554470b7818560\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**10. \\[INNISFREE\\] Superfood Blueberry Rebalancing Skin - 4.05 (6,670 Reviews)**\n\n350ml/14,000 KRW\n\nWater, Dipropylene Glycol, Propanediol, Glycerin, Glycereth-26, 1,2-Hexanediol, Polyquaternium-51, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis(Orange) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, C12-14 Pareth-12, Methyl Gluceth-20, Triethylhexanoin,Diphenyl Dimethicone, Butylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Polyglyceryl-10 Oleate, Glyceryl Caprylate, Pentylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y8b4a01tvd731.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=db65674441858a6bc27eda9bc51f8bf43360905b\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**11. \\[Kiehl's\\] Calendula Herbal Extract Toner - 4.09/5 (3,776 Reviews)**\n\n250ml/59,000 KRW\n\nWater, Propylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Methylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Arctium Lappa Extract/Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Calendula Officinalis Extract/Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Corn Starch, Allantoin, Hedera Helix Extract - Ivy Leaf/Stem Extract, Althaea Officinalis/Althaea Officinalis Root Extract.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ko96mlkwvd731.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=81b5cd28692582782f2a31089406aa802d8ed543\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**12. \\[IsNtree\\] Hyaluronic Acid Toner - 4.06/5 (10,677 Reviews)**\n\n200ml/12,000 KRW\n\nSodium Hyaluronate • Water • Glycerin • Butylene Glycol • Trehalose • Betula Alba Juice • Beta-Glucan • Soluble Collagen • Althaea Rosea Flower Extract • Aloe Barbadenis Leaf Extract • Portulaca Oleracea Extract • Panthenol • Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract • Pulsatilla Koreana Extact • Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract • Hydroxy Ethyl Cellulose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/keod4ggyvd731.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b714ce84a3c4e86195036a4a544e519d98a1413d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**13. \\[BEAUTIQLO\\] Noni Fresh Balance Skin Toner - 4.25/5 (1,404 Reviews)**\n\n200ml/14,500 KRW\n\nMorinda Citrifolia (Noni) Fruit Extract (50%), Mineral Water/Eau Mnérale, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract Water/Eau, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Beta-Glucan, Centella Asiatica, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Betaine, Glycerin, Camellia Japonica flower Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Green Tea Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Sodium PCA, Allantoin, Panthenol, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Polyglutamic Acid, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yd9ag0o3wd731.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a78deee55f2be25cdf40c37778424fe35e80c85\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**14. \\[2SOL\\] Sunhan Salgyeolsu Water Toner - 4.12/5 (2,426 Reviews)**\n\n200ml/7,420 KRW\n\nPurified water, Glycerin(vegetable), Butylene Glycol, PEG-75, Witch Hazel leaf Extract, Protulaca Oleracea Extract, Poly-Glutamic Acid,  Anthemis Nobillis(camomile) Flower Extract, Bacopa Monniera Extract, Aloe Vera Leaf Powder, Spiraea Ulmaria(meadowsweet) Extract, Guaiazulene, Hydrolyzed Opuntia Ficus Indica Flower Extract, Mannan, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrizate, Syringa Vulgaris (Lilac) leaf Cell Culture Extract, Piper Methysticum Leaf/Root/Stem Extract, Citrus Grandis Peel Extract, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Oryzanol, Saccharide Isomerate, Panthenol, Betain, Sorbitol, Sodium PCA, Magnesium Aspartate, Zinc Gluconate, Copper Gluconate, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Levulinic Acid, Citric Acid, Sodium Levulinate,  P-Anisic Acid, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Hydroxide.\n\n*Fun fact: \"2SOL\" isn't pronounced 2 soul, it's E (just say the letter E) sol.

Over the years I have tried numerous shampoo treatments: anti-dandruff, anti-fungal, coal-tar, ketoconazole based, topical corticosteroids treatments, emollients, prescription only shampoos; I even tried things like apple cider vinegar, but in all honesty none really worked.  I even found that some seemed to make it worse (ketoconazole seemed to make the reddening *REALLY* bad for days afterwards).\n\nAnyway, one day I was away and had run out of my medicated shampoo so I borrowed some shampoo called [**Aussie Miracle Moist**](http://imgur.com/b7Xvdfz).  The next day or so I noticed a considerable lessening of the symptoms, so I bought some and used it a few times in the following week or two and the weirdest thing happened - my symptoms totally disappeared!  **NOTHING** had ever had this effect before.  I could even eat really spicy foods or dairy foods, which always seemed to exacerbate the S.D. causing terrible flare ups.  It's like I accidentally happened upon a cure!\n\nAnyway, just for the record, I am not in any way affiliated to this shampoo and I've no idea why it has worked and if it is coincidental to just me, but on investigation one of the active ingredients in Macadamia Nut oil which is [**documented**](http://thenakedchemist.com/benefits-of-macadamia-nut-oil-in-skin-care) to help various skin conditions (including S.D.).  Anyway, I thought I'd share this, and if you suffer from Seborrhoeic Dermatitis maybe you'd like to give it a go and see if it helps?  Perhaps you already use it and also found it worked for you?",

My self-esteem was non existent. I looked for hours and found a moisturizer called Gold Bond ultime healing with aloe vera. I used it immediately after I bought it on Walgreens. After a few hours my face was better but still red. in about a day and a half. It is completely gone and I have not used it for two weeks. Sometimes I use it if my skin is dry, but other than that it cured me. I think that the flare ups last so long because the skin is trying to heal, but it cant because of the bacteria eating all the oil in one's skin. Idk but this solved my dermatitis. For the scalp I used some shampoo that seems to be working given to me by the doctor. Hope it helps anyone. I just wanted to share this because I know how it feels to wake up and feel like everyone will laugh at you or look at you weird. Im not trying to advertise the product.. it costs like $6 so definitely give it a try if you have it on your face.",

    "body": "[Photo album here of the product! :)](http://imgur.com/a/Xl5nS)\n\nSo I've seen this product mentioned a lot on here, but for some reason there aren't very many reviews either here or online in general. Well, hopefully this will change that! \n\nI bought this off the ebay seller alphabeautyuk. It took a whole month to arrive but boy, am I glad it did. I love this product already.\n\nI bought this product because of my dehydrated skin. I can't wash my face without it feeling tight at all. Not even with water. As soon as I've dried my face with a towel, the tightness comes creeping and I'm already running to slap on some moisturising/hydrating products. Then this product comes to the rescue. This contains 3 ceramides and cholesterol which is great at repairing ones moisture barrier and basically \"curing\" dehydration. Also no fragrance, alcohol or any common irritants which is great for my rosacea skin.\n\nAnd it really does repair moisture barriers. I used it yesterday evening and this morning. Tonight I went to wash my face and as I had dried it, I waited. No tightness.\n\nI repeat, *no tightness*. This was after **2 uses**. I'm so happy I bought it already. I'll totally recommend this to anyone who can't get Cerave or who can't use it because it breaks them out but who still wants lots of ceramides in their routine. \n\nBesides its amazing capabilities at repairing my barrier in basically a day, some general points on it as a product:\n\n- It has a weird smell. I don't really care much and it doesn't really linger, but for some people who love more fragranced products, it could seem.. boring? It just has a typical non-scented chemical smell.\n\n- It's very heavy and it's easy to apply too much, leaving your face sticky and shiny. I'd mostly recommend this as a night cream but I used in the daytime too, keeping the layer thin. As it absorbs in 10-15 minutes, the stickiness and shininess disappears (at least for me but my skin just drinks up products). Very oily skinned people should probably only use it in the night time.\n\n- The spatula is really useful at keeping things clean, and it has a good size too. One small scoop is the perfect amount for my face.\n\n- It contains macadamia nut oil which is a very occlusive oil and could potentially be acne triggering in some. So far I haven't had any problems. [Full ingredient list here](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_9fb8217880.html).\n\nI think that's it! All in all, a super great product, and you get a decent amount for fairly cheap too. I hope anyone who's been doubting whether to get this product or not feel clearer in their decision now :)\n\nedit: I apologise for any weirdly worded sentences, English is not my first language and I'm *super* tired - I just hope it's readable, haha",

Leave it wet and put moisturizer over the wetness, or if you're toning and going into other steps, let it air dry enough to put on the toner (I wipe off as much of the water as I can with my hands and wait just a couple minutes, so there are still some droplets standing on my face) and go from there.\n\nI found this advice in [this post](http://www.snowwhiteandtheasianpear.com/2014/08/skincare-discovery-cleansing-part-ii.html) and there's a [video](http://youtu.be/shr5W2oTrtE).

My rosette ceramide gel jar isn't 6 years old lol. (I was sooo worried) \n\nSo this is something u/chikurin (thank you again!) wrote and might be useful:\n\n > The Rosette Ceramide Gel doesn't have an expiration/manufacturing date labeled on it per se, but it does have a manufacturing code printed on the bottom of the jar. I don't know the exact coding methods, but I can give you an idea of when they were manufactured. I have two jars that you can compare to:\n\n> EG28B - Purchased October 2015\n\n> EI13A - Purchased December 2015\n\n> I'm guessing if it starts with an E, it's probably manufactured in 2015.

    "body": "I'm From wash off masks are well-loved in the Asian Beauty community. So I've been trying a few of these out and wanted to let you all know my experiences with them! The Fig Scrub Mask is a new product I received as a beauty tester for Wishtrend. Would have preferred getting the essence or cleansing balm instead, but hey! A free product's a free product.\n\n**I'm From Honey Mask**\n\n*Ingredients:*\n\n>Honey, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Pentylene Glycol, Microcrystalline Wax, Polysorbate 20, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Beeswax, Tocopheryl Acetate, Argania Spinosa Kernel Extract, Corylus Avellana (Hazel) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Water, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Propolis Extract, Beta-Glucan, Bee Venom, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Sophora Angustifolia Root Extract, Eugenia Caryophyllus (Clove) Flower Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Punica Granatum Fruit Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin\n\n*Overview:*\n\n- Looks and feels like a thick, gooey caramel sauce. Smells sweet since there's a lot of honey in this, but it's notably a medicinal type of honey scent. If you've ever smelled manuka honey this scent is within that general ballpark.\n- May separate occasionally. All you have to do is stir and it's good to go.\n- Pretty much never dries down. They recommend leaving it on for 10-60 minutes. Dry people would probably benefit more from leaving it on longer, but 60 minutes is overkill. I just do 30 minutes.\n- My first time washing this off, I had removed most of it with a wet paper towel (to save my clog prone sink) but thought it was strange that everything hadn't been taken off yet no matter how much I rinsed. Then I realized - no, that wasn't the mask. Or any residue. That plump, bouncy thing I was touching was just MY FACE. This mask just seems to max out your moisture levels like mad.\n- I think most people would really enjoy the Honey Mask. Dry and dehydrated skin types would especially love it. People who are oily and already have enough moisture may find it doesn't do much for them, though.\n\n**I'm From Mugwort Mask**\n\n*Ingredients:*\n\n>Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cordyceps Sinensis Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Methylpropanediol, Ligularia Fishceri Leaf Extract, Rosa Davurica Bud Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Sodium Polyacrylaste, Carbomer, Arginine, Phenoxyethanol, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Panthenol, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA\n\n*Overview:*\n\n- A clearish brown gel with bits of real mugwort. This is not supposed to be an exfoliating mask so be careful and don't rub those pieces in too much.\n- Kinda looks like you've rubbed dirt all over your face. Not necessarily a bad thing.\n- There's a distinctive scent. I've never specifically encountered mugwort before delving into K-beauty, but opening this immediately reminded me of the smell from Chinese traditional herbal stores. This smell isn't overwhelmingly strong but it is present. People who dislike those kinds of earthy scents will probably hate this.\n- Actually dries down. About 10-15 minutes depending on how thin of a layer you put on.\n- In contrast to the honey mask which excels at nourishing and plumping out your skin, the mugwort masks excels at reducing redness and calming irritation. It also made my face look a bit brighter.\n- It's not a moisture bomb like the honey mask. But it's enough to keep my skin decently hydrated and in a pretty good state.\n- This mask is pretty lightweight. Pretty much anyone can use this. Rather than a question of \"do you want a product for your skin type\", it's more of a question of \"do you have irritated skin and want a product targeted towards calming it down?\" The Mugwort Mask definitely delivers in this regard.\n\n**I'm From Fig Scrub Mask**\n\n*Ingredients:*\n\n>Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sucrose, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate , Stearalkonium Hectorite, C13-15 Alkane, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Powder, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Seed Meal, Fragrance(Parfum), Juglans Regia (Walnut) Shell Powder, Caprylyl Glycol, Caramel\n\n*Overview:*\n\n- Since this is a new product many people haven't seen yet, [here's some pictures!](https://imgur.com/a/Yh4QBfs)\n- Disclaimer: I'm not someone who usually uses scrubs on my face. So I can't really compare it to other products of this type.\n- The Honey Mask is gooey. The Mugwort Mask is a gel. I would the describe the Fig Scrub Mask as chunky.\n- This is an exfoliating wash off mask primarily made of sugar and fig powder. It has tiny 1mm wide nut pieces which are either the sweet almond or walnut shell listed in the ingredients. \n- There's a light fruit scent. Presumably this is what fig smells like, but can't confirm as I've never actually eaten fig. As Kelly Driscoll mentioned with the Ginseng line - if an I'm From product has a fragrant component it might just be included to amplify whatever scent's already in there. It doesn't seem to be an artificial fruit scent. Still find it unnecessary and would have preferred this product to have no fragrance at all. It's an exfoliating mask so what's the point?\n- The instructions say to leave it on for 10-15 minutes and then gently rub for a few more minutes. It doesn't say whether you're supposed to put it on wet or dry skin. I assume the wait time is for softening dead skin cells, so dry skin is probably the way to go.\n- As with all physical exfoliants - the end result will mainly depend on the user. Contrary to the name, you shouldn't actually scrub your face with this like you would scrub burnt bits off a pan. Please be gentle when massaging this in.\n- Could feel the mask warming up with the heat of my face and becoming a little more pliable. Not all the sugar's going to dissolve. Don't wait for that to be an indication of when you should stop rubbing. Just lightly glide with circular motions a couple times and wash it off.\n- My first time using this, there were flakes around my mouth (maybe from not massaging there enough) and a puffy red patch on my cheek (maybe from massaging there a little too much). So it's important to be thorough, but it's even more important to be gentle.\n- This leaves a similar moisturized feeling to the Honey Mask but to a lesser degree. My face feels smooth after.\n\n**Some further comments:**\n\n- The Honey and Mugwort Masks are available in sample size tubes. So try those out before buying the full size. Good for 5-6 uses.\n- Nobody else mentioned this, but all I'm From wash off masks come with a handy spatula.\n- The Fig Scrub Mask primarily uses capric triglyceride. This is also included in the Honey Mask, but with 60% confirmed honey and a lot of other ingredients it should be much lower than 40%. Capric triglyceride is a coconut oil derivative. It's included in a lot of other well-known skincare products and definitely not as bad as straight up raw coconut oil. But if you have a sensitivity or are clog-prone to coconut-derived ingredients, I'd say avoid the Fig/Honey Masks.\n- The Honey Mask is an easy universal recommendation to most people. But all these masks are meant to target different things. Anyone wondering which one to get should primarily choose one for their own skin concerns.\n\ntldr; honey for moisture/mugwort for soothing/fig for physical exfoliating\n\nThank you for reading this word vomit! By the way, if anyone has any tips for wearing glasses on top of wash-off masks, I'd love to know.",

Cetaphil is available in two sizes- 30gm for Rs 185 and and 100 gm for Rs 435 (often available at some off at Nykaa). Re'equil one is available in only one size, 100gm for Rs 350.\n* *Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:* DAM- HG/WRP, RE'EQUIL: WNRP.\n\n**Experience:** \n\nHello all\n\nUsually I use lighter moisturiser but winters had me looking for an apt moituriser for my skin, since it gets dry and skin tends to become flaky. I was earlier using Simple Light moisturiser and Disguise Cosmetic's Sorbet, but both of these were proving insufficient for winters, hence decided to try DAM and Re'equil.\n\nAs you can see both of them have beautiful ingredients, though Re'equil one has fragrance (it is the last ingredient, the smell is mild and nice) while DAM is fragrance free.\n\nFor my skin type, I require a small amount of both of these  moisturisers. Though Re'equil is heavier- it is a cream albeit not a thick one, while DAM is lighter comparatively and has lotion like consistency.\n\nI started with using DAM during the morning routine. Needless to say, my skin did not feel dry at all. There was no need for reapplication either. It also did not react with my skin. So overall, I am very satisfied with this. Might this be love? Probably.\n\nRe'equil one I used in my PM routine. Now this moisturiser and I go long back because back in June, I got this for my younger sibling, who has a dry-dehydrated skin which is also prone to blackheads, whiteheads and acne. I wanted her to start looking after her skin a bit so I got her a bunch of products, one of which was this. It suited her nicely, though it is another matter altogether that she was never consistent with her routine. I guess skincare enlightenment has to occur on its own to a person for one to really get invested in it. Sigh. \n\nI also would use it occasionally then, and it did feel a little heavy on my combination skin so I decided to use it during winters. Cut to November, I started applying it in my nighttime routine. However after a couple of days, I could see some acne on my forehead. It probably clogged my pores. I stopped using it for some time, and the acne receded (my skin is not acne prone). I thought I should give it a try again, and once more I could see tiny acne on my forehead. I have since then decided to cut it off my routine. It is a great moisturiser, very nourishing. As mentioned, it works for my sister, but unfortunately it is not for me. \n\nRe'equil's finish is more matte, and it can be seen and felt immediately while DAM can feel slightly greasy on immediate application but sinks in fast and also provides a nice, smooth finish.\n\n**Conclusion**: So for the past one week, I have been using DAM in my AM as well as PM routine and I am more than satisfied. I think DAM is going to be my HG for winters atleast. Not sure how it is going to fare in summers, that remains to be seen. Hope this is helpful for folks looking for winter moisturisers. :)",

Re'equil on my skin felt stickier on my skin and didn't sit comfortably the couple times i used it. DAM feels light and absorbs well. Another odd thing I felt with the Re'equil moisturizer was that it left a slight white cast which I didnt appreciate at all, especially in the AM when I'm expecting a white cast from my sunscreen as well. \nMy vote goes for Cetaphil in the two.",

    "body": "**Skin** : Dehydrated + Oily + Dry Patches + Acne. My skin feels easily suffocated. I have Sahara Desert around Mouth and Oil tankers on Cheeks.\n\n**Cost**: 950Rs for 500ml (I got it for cheaper price in Nykaa Summer sale : \\~560Rs )\n\n The opening of the bottle is a tiny hole which is provided with a cap that can be removed and set again. It helps in preventing any leakage from bottle. I am basically very lazy to hold that big bottle, so I transferred some toner to TO Serum bottle and using it. \n\n**The Feel:**\n\nIt has watery flowy consistency. The cloudy milky color gives the feeling of moisture in my head. It doesn't have any strong fragrance. It gives a very light healthy dewy glow finish to the skin post application. I didn't get any irritation / itching particularly from this toner.\n\n**My experiments:** \n\nI initially used it alone and my dehydrated skin just drank up all the toner and it gave smooth texture and the hydrated glow to my oily skin. It definitely worked for me and I could see the difference by 2nd time of use itself. However, I felt that the toner alone was not enough to prevent TEWL. I felt dehydrated again after 3 times of using this toner alone.\n\nI then started using the toner for sometime in the hot and humid climate and topping it with thick moisturizer and heavy sunscreen. I broke out. I realized that my skin is feeling too much moisturization and oily. So, I had to stop using this toner and sunscreen (I stayed away from sun) and switched to a light moisturizer until my breakouts calmed down. But, deep down I badly needed that hydration that the toner gives. \n\n**How I ended up using it:**\n\nCurrently, I'm mixing 4-5 drops of the toner to my moisturizer (Nivea Soft) and woahhh I love it. I feel like I can make the right consistency of the mixture for my skin. It feels hydrated and moisturized at the same time now. My skin looks very much normal and nice instead of being too oily or too dry. I'm surprised the way my crazy skin has finally found the balance.\n\n I also tried adding few drops of the toner to Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion and it didn't go well at all. Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion has this different consistency that doesn't go well with this toner when mixed up. However, I like it well with Nivea Soft. I get more lighter version of Nivea Soft by mixing with this toner.  Also, my skin never felt dehydrated again with this toner + moisturizer mixing technique. This is the way I'm going to use this or any other toner for the rest of my life. \n\nI definitely like to repurchase this toner considering the discount and the quantity we get for it. \n\n**Full Ingredients List:**\n\n Water Dipropylene Glycol Glycerin Water Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate Glycereth-26 1,2-Hexanediol Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil Water Phenyl Trimethicone Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer Styrene/VP Copolymer Centella Asiatica Extract Ethylhexylglycerin Glycerin Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer Tromethamine Disodium EDTA Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil Citrus Limon (Lemon) Seed Oil Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride Water Allantoin Hydrogenated Lecithin Phytosteryl/Octyldodecyl Lauroyl Glutamate Panthenol Ceramide NP Sodium Hyaluronate Linalool Limonene",

    "body": "Random reviews of both longtime favourites and new products!\n\n**Skin profile**: 20F, combination (currently summer = oily T zone and normal cheeks), CC prone forehead, PIH, compromised skin barrier from picking at it all the time (I know, I really need to stop)\n\n**Climate**: subtropical, very hot and humid during summer\n\n**Kose Suncut Super Waterproof Gel**\n\n* HG — my daily sunscreen!\n* Chemical/organic sunscreen — zero white cast on my East Asian, approx NC25 skintone\n* Fragrance free but contains alcohol, but doesn't smell super strongly of alcohol (unlike the Biore UV Essence)\n* Very light and refreshing, kind of bursts into water when you rub it in (to quote Lab Muffin)\n* Has a subtle glowy finish on me. For us oily or combo skin folks, the line between glowy and greasy is often very fine — this falls comfortably on the glowy side for me, unlike many other supposedly glowy/\"moisturising\" sunscreens that end up reading greasy on me. It also helps that this sunscreen dries down completely and doesn't leave a greasy/silicone-y feeling (which I hate) — so it leaves more of a \"water glow\" rather than an \"oily glow\" (idk if this makes any sense).\n* The main (and IMO, only) problem with this sunscreen is that pills. I've tried basically everything to make it stop pilling, from applying hydrating layers underneath to applying it on bare skin — nothing helps. BUT for me, the pilling only happens if I rub my face or wear a mask. I can also reapply without any pilling issues — if the first layer has started to pill, I just lightly remove the pilled bits and reapply over it.\n* The pilling is a problem if you wear base makeup. I don't wear makeup most days, so it's not an issue for me — but the second you try to rub in foundation, it will pill. Tapping/blotting motions *might* be okay (eg using a cushion or beauty blender), but I haven't tried this. TBH on my makeup days I just don't bother with this and use a different sunscreen.\n* Forms a light film over the skin — it's not a sunscreen that feels invisible or you'll forget you're wearing. This film is both what makes it waterproof and what makes it pill. It isn't a heavy feeling by any means, and I highly highly prefer it over the silicone-y feeling that many sunscreens have, such as the Biore UV Essence or LRP Anthelios (non AB).\n\n**Purito Unscented Recovery Cream**\n\n* WNRP. Not a bad product, just not really made for my skin type (which is my fault for not realising lol) and unfortunately didn't do much for me in terms of barrier repair.\n* Has a very emollient, true \"cream\" texture (contains lots of oils and shea butter, 4th ingredient = macadamia nut oil and 5th = squalane). Feels very nourishing and moisturising which dryer skin types might like! Not sure about occlusivity and whether it would be enough alone for dry skin.\n* Not suitable for CC prone skin\n* I didn't find it particularly soothing or good for barrier repair, despite its impressive ingredient list which contains 50% centella, ceramides, asiaticoside, adenosine etc. However, I do have to say that this never stung my skin, even when it was red and irritated.\n* Leaves a greasy finish, particularly on my oilier T zone\n\n**Skin1004 Madagascar Centella Watergel Sheet Ampoule Mask**\n\n* WNRP :(\n* I had really high hopes that this might be the perfect mask for my skin that is CC prone, yet in need of barrier repair and calming. It contains 51% centella and is one of the few masks (and products in general tbh) that doesn't have butylene glycol as one of the very first ingredients (it does have it, but it's 8th on the ingredients list)\n* This mask irritated my skin, due to the Mentha Arvensis Leaf Oil (mint oil). Immediately after putting the mask on, I noticed a slight burning feeling in the sensitive parts of my face (eg my \"moustache\" area). I (perhaps stupidly) left this on, because I thought that this mask was supposed to have \"cooling\" feeling courtesy of the mint oil. In the \\~20 minutes I left this on, the cooling/burning feeling didn't intensify, but it didn't go away either.\n* After I took the mask off, my skin was red and irritated for the rest of the night. It wasn't an allergic reaction — allergic reactions for me take the form of itchy rashes and small bumps. This red/irritated feeling was exactly like how my skin reacts to an AHA that's too strong for me — my skin is red and warm for the rest of the night, but looks completely normal the next morning. Either way, not an enjoyable experience and definitely not what I'm looking for with a relaxing sheet mask.\n* The ampoule that the sheet mask is soaked in has some viscosity to it, which I like because I hate drippy sheet masks that get everywhere when you remove them from the packet. BUT some combination of the serum texture and the thick sheet mask material meant this mask did not want to stay on my face. The whole time the mask was on (especially towards the beginning, when the sheet mask was the most damp), it slowly slid down my face. This was super annoying because I kept having to adjust it.\n* The mask also didn't fit my face well (which I didn't dock points for but thought I would mention anyway) — it was both too narrow and too long. I don't have an especially round face, but I guess this mask was made for someone with a super narrow and long face\n\n**Romand Glasting Melting Balm** \\- 06 Kaya Fig, 07 Mauve Whip\n\n* WRP\n* The best way to describe this product is that it's more of a lip gloss stick than a tinted lip balm. Both the formula and the way it looks and feels is very gloss-like\n* Leaves a super glossy finish (again, kind of like a glass lip)!\n* Formula gets more glossy as it melts on your lips, so the full glossiness only appears a few minutes after application\n* Formula is like one of those non-retractable lip balms — while you can technically retract the balm, they recommend that you don't twist it up too high because it won't hold its shape. Romand also designed a special \"micro dosing\" tube which doesn't allow you to twist out that much product at once\n* Quite pigmented for a tinted lip balm, especially if you get one of the brighter shades\n* Very moisturising! It leaves a (somewhat tacky) residue even after you wipe it off, which so lips stay moisturised\n* If you're like me and you hate it tasting your lip balms, this one doesn't have that problem! Some lip balms have a tendency to migrate into your mouth and no matter what you do, you'll taste it the whole time you're wearing it (the L'occitane Golden Latte lip balm is the *worst* for this). I find this happens the most with oil/petroleum jelly based lip balms — waxy or sticky/glossy lip balms (like this one) are usually okay.\n\n**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask \\[Berry\\]** (both the old and reformulated 'EX' versions)\n\n* WRP, but not at full price\n* I found it is effective as an overnight \"mask\", in the sense that if I apply a thick layer, it didn't disappear before morning and prevents TEWL through the night.\n* That said, I've also been religiously applying a Vaseline every night since I was about 10, and to this day I still alternate between Vaseline and this mask — so I can confidently say Vaseline does just a good, if not a better job lol\n* The reason I keep using this and will probably repurchase is because 1) it leaves a beautiful glossy finish, almost like \"glass\" lips 2) I really love the user experience — I love applying it with the little spatula it comes with, it smells good, and the packaging is nice 3) I get it from a retailer that sells it for around USD$6-7, which for me is really not that expensive, especially as a jar will easily last me 6-9 months\n* The original and EX feel exactly the same to me — the only perceptible change is the spatula, which is shorter and in a different envelope-like container. I prefer the old spatula & envelope, but this is definitely a very minor complaint\n* Like to the Romand, not a lip balm that tastes very strong!\n\nPlease feel free to ask further questions! I love talking about skincare and all my friends and family are sick of hearing me going on about it 😢🤣",

This change in the composition of fatty acids parallels a significant increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity. Experimental studies have suggested that omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids elicit divergent effects on body fat gain through mechanisms of adipogenesis, browning of adipose tissue, lipid homeostasis, brain-gut-adipose tissue axis, and most importantly systemic inflammation. Prospective studies clearly show an increase in the risk of obesity as the level of omega-6 fatty acids and the omega-6/omega-3 ratio increase in red blood cell (RBC) membrane phospholipids, whereas high omega-3 RBC membrane phospholipids decrease the risk of obesity. Recent studies in humans show that in addition to absolute amounts of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acid intake, the omega-6/omega-3 ratio plays an important role in increasing the development of obesity via both AA eicosanoid metabolites and hyperactivity of the cannabinoid system, which can be reversed with increased intake of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A balanced omega-6/omega-3 ratio is important for health and in the prevention and management of obesity.

Conclusions and Recommendations\n> \n> -   Human beings evolved on a diet that was balanced in the omega-6 and omega-3 essential fatty acids.\n>     \n> -   A high omega-6 fatty acid intake and a high omega-6/omega-3 ratio are associated with weight gain in both animal and human studies, whereas a high omega-3 fatty acid intake decreases the risk for weight gain. Lowering the LA/ALA ratio in animals prevents overweight and obesity.\n>     \n> -   Omega-6/omega-3 fatty acids compete for their biosynthetic enzymes and because they have distinct physiological and metabolic properties, their balanced omega-6/omega-3 ratio is a critical factor for health throughout the life cycle.\n>     \n> -   Adipose tissue is the main peripheral target organ handling fatty acids, and AA is required for adipocyte differentiation (adipogenesis). The increased LA and AA content of foods has been accompanied by a significant increase in the AA/EPA + DHA ratio within adipose tissue, leading to increased production in AA metabolites, PGI2 which stimulates white adipogenesis and PGF2α which inhibits the browning process, whereas increased consumption of EPA and DHA leads to adipose tissue homeostasis through adipose tissue loss and increased mitochondrial biogenesis.\n>     \n> -   High omega-6 fatty acid intake leads to hyperactivity of endocannabinoid system, whereas omega-3 fatty acids lead to normal homeostasis (decrease hyperactivity).\n>     \n> -   High omega-6 fatty acids increase leptin resistance and insulin resistance, whereas omega-3 fatty acids lead to homeostasis and weight loss.\n>     \n> -   Because a high omega-6/omega-3 ratio is associated with overweight/obesity, whereas a balanced ratio decreases obesity and weight gain, it is essential that every effort is made to decrease the omega-6 fatty acids in the diet, while increasing the omega-3 fatty acid intake. This can be accomplished by (1) changing dietary vegetable oils high in omega-6 fatty acids (corn oil, sunflower, safflower, cottonseed, and soybean oils) to oils high in omega-3s (flax, perilla, chia, rapeseed), and high in monounsaturated oils such as olive oil, macadamia nut oil, hazelnut oil, or the new high monounsaturated sunflower oil; and (2) increasing fish intake to 2–3 times per week, while decreasing meat intake.\n>     \n> -   In clinical investigations and intervention trials it is essential that the background diet is precisely defined in terms of the omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acid content. Because the final concentrations of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids are determined by both dietary intake and endogenous metabolism, it is essential that in all clinical investigations and intervention trials the omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids are precisely determined in the red blood cell membrane phospholipids. In severe obesity drugs and bariatric surgery have been part of treatment.\n>     \n> -   The risk allele rs 1421085 T to C SNV in intron 1 and 2 in the FTO gene functioned similarly to AA metabolites, PGI2 and PGF2a increasing proliferation of white adipose tissue and decreasing its browning respectively, whereas the knockdown of IRX3 and IRX5 genes functioned similarly to omega-3 fatty acid metabolites increasing the browning of white adipose tissue, mitochondrial biogenesis, and thermogenesis. Therefore, further research should include studies on the effects of omega-3 fatty acids in blocking the effects of the risk allele (rs 1421085), which appears to be responsible for the association between the first intron of FTO gene and obesity in humans.\n>     \n> -   In the future studies on genetic variants from GWAS will provide opportunities to precisely treat and prevent obesity by both nutritional and pharmaceutical interventions.\n>     \n> \n> Obesity is a preventable disease that can be treated through proper diet and exercise. A balanced omega-6/omega-3 ratio 1–2/1 is one of the most important dietary factors in the prevention of obesity, along with physical activity. A lower omega-6/omega-3 ratio should be considered in the management of obesity.\n> \n\n---\n\n\nfound here: https://twitter.com/nicknorwitz/status/1345703852595687425",

Use something simple such as extra virgin olive oil or almond oil to cleanse because it takes you less than five minutes to do OCM and the oil will be washed down the drain. You won't get any benefits unless you use them as a moisturizer.\n\nMacadamia nut and kukui nut are very light. I don't think it'll do anything for OCM because it can absorb fast. Both of them are suitable for oily skin.\n\nPomegranate oil is very expensive and thicker than maple syrup. It must be diluted with another carrier oil - no more than 20%, I think... Or that is 10%? It's really pointless to use it for OCM. Use it as a moisturizer. \n\nPumpkin seed oil is very rich and shouldn't use more than 10%. It goes the same with papaya seed oil - if you use full strength, it might irritate your skin.\n\nI'd go with rice bran oil and/or sesame seed oil as OCM and the rest of them should be used as moisturizers to have better benefits for your skin.",

I am currently living in Japan and have very little access to curly hair care without having to ship stuff (which is quite expensive and not always possible). I cant even find coconut oil. I have found a Japanese conditioner which is all organic and doesn't seem to have anything bad in it but my hair is not responding AT ALL. I ordered some marshmallow root to help with slip but my hair is very dry and hard and frizzy and tangled and unhappy. So I am unhappy.\n\nI wash my hair twice a week. I put some conditioner in it and massage my scalp and cold rinse. I then use conditioner to detangle. After detangling I put a mixture of olive oil and honey on my hair with some Marc Anthony Curl cream (which I have to import and has evil ingredients too)\n\nIt takes over an hour to detangle (with my fingers). I want to know what I am doing so wrong so that I can keep on looking for a conditioner that works or some extra ingredients to import to mix with my current conditioner. I used to use Tressame Moisture Rich (which is also not available in Japan) but I noticed it had dimethicone in it so I stopped but my curls felt and looked soo much happier back then. I am so frustrated. \n\nThe conditioner I am using now has many emolients in the ingredients and not so many moisturizing components but I dont know what to add.\n\nTop 15 ingredients are: water, Behenyl\tSynthetic (rapeseed, etc.), \nBehenyl PG trimonium chloride, Alga near spinosa kernel oil, Macadamia nut oil, Damask rose flower oil, Atlas Cedar bark oil, Lavender oil, Jojoba seed oil, Olive oil, Broccoli seed oil, Almond oil, Rose hip oil, Sunflower seed oil \n\nThe website with detailed ingredients is below, google translate works very well (I am sorry):\nhttp://www.matsukiyo.co.jp/mkc/argelan/products/argan_treatment.html\n\nI washed my hair this morning. Let it air dry and the result is here --> http://imgur.com/8RjAeB7\nhttp://imgur.com/vaNdT4p",

        "body": "Hello fellow expat! *waves from Hiroshima*\n\nI, too, have been using the same brand now for a few months on my 2b-c/3a mix, and have had good results. Are you using the ancient clay or the macadamia conditioner? I use the ancient clay stuff 1-2 times a week with the pink clay mask once a week after shampooing with the seaweed mineral gel. S2C comes out feeling a bit sticky on second day and third day curls, but I think I just haven't found the right amount of conditioner for it yet. I did condition a bit more often when I started using it, probably closer to every other day.\n\nSo far, this is the best stuff I've found for curly hair in the country in the 10 years I've been here. I used to use the Je L'Aime Amino line in the pink bottles, but the conditioner and deep conditioner still had silicones and made the back of my head crispy. The other brand I liked that I haven't seen in Hiroshima is RinRen: http://www.bxe.co.jp/rinren/en/ Silicone free and I do believe SLS free even though they don't advertise it. I used to find it at Sugi Pharmacy when I lived in Gifu, so if you have any of those around you try looking for it there.\n\nI don't personally use coconut oil, but I have seen it more often in higher-end grocery stores lately. I have no idea if that's even usable on hair, to be honest. Most AEON and YouMe Town shopping malls should have a Kaldi shop in them, which usually sells coconut oil among its import baking items.\n\nIf you haven't tried it yet, iherb.com is a great site for hair care items. I order my Kinky Curly Styling Custard through them, along with multivitamins and melatonin to qualify for free shipping. If you haven't tried iHerb yet and are interested, lemme know. I should have a referral code that should give you a bit of a discount.",

Her curls have always been superior because of this IMHO.\n\nShe lived in japan for over a year and while shes never embraced her curls like i do, she started spending a LOT of time straighening and blow drying and using curling irons etc.\n\nI think i know why now!\n\nYou may just want to explore options getting stuff shipped in. My sister is 6' and like a size 0, and wears a 11-12 shoe and despite being model thin couldnt find clothes (even XL and mens stuff was too short) and shoes (mens shoes didnt fit) and ended up ordering things to my moms house via amazon/zappos, then having my mom ship cheap to japan. It was cheaper than shipping from those sites to japan direct.\n\nI think if i was moving there priority #1 would be bras (28GG) and #2 would be conditioners. Lol.\n\nHopefully you can find something!",

    "body": "Hey all,\n\nSo we used to do these on SCA and people requested them!\n\nI'm starting with a very easy and popular brand: The Ordinary. Feel free to suggest me what should be discussed next and I'll see about posting them weekly.\n\nA bit of a format for your posts:\n\n* **Product Name**\n* **Price**\n* **Skin type and concerns**\n* **Mini-review** - What did you like about it? Dislike about it? How did your skin react?\n\n\n---\n\nSo I'll start a bit:\n\n* **Product Name** - The Ordinary Sea Buckthorn Fruit Oil\n* **Price** - $14.90/30mL\n* **Skin type and concerns** - Hypersensitive, rosacean. Redness, acne, aging.\n* **Mini-review** - \n\n\nIt comes in a glass, UV-protective bottle with a dropper, and like every product I’ve ever used from the Ordinary, feels sturdy. No weird screw-cap issues with this bottle!\n\nWhen I first tried this oil, I put it on with a 1:1 ratio with my jojoba oil. BIG MISTAKE. I am pretty fair, so the generous ratio of sea-buckthorn oil to jojoba turned my face orange. And not like the warm glow of a good fake tan, but the yellow of “holy hell this turmeric mask just turned me orange dear god what have I done.” After this first night, I began to dilute it in a 1:5 sea-buckthorn to jojoba ratio, but it was still quite noticeably yellow-orange.\n\nMy boyfriend swore he couldn’t see it in low lighting, but later brought in my white pillowcase to shame me and ask if I had been doing something less than appropriate with my pillowcase at night. Thankfully these stains washed out easily.\n\nThis strong red-orangey hue is due to the high contents of beta-carotene in the oil. It’s the same coloring that gives the famed Stratia Liquid Gold it’s color.\n\nIn the morning, my skin still appeared a bit yellow, and indeed, when I swiped a cotton across my face with some Hada Labo, the cotton square pulled back with a light yellow tint.\n\nUnfortunately, after a couple of days, the oil did begin to break me out. At first, it was just a small cyst on my forehead, which I discounted as being due to hair products and my new cut sitting on my skin a bit. However, as the days went on, one cropped up on my jawline during a normally clear timeframe of the month. This is when I realized it was probably due to the oil.\n\nAs soon as I stopped using the oil every night and went back to my typical routine, the spots began to subside.\n\nThis is not entirely surprising for me. I had a hunch that macadamia nut oil wasn’t a good fit for me years prior, and sea-buckthorn oil is pretty similar to it. I also just don’t seem to do well with high oleic oils in general, as I’ve had breakouts from argan oil in the past.\n\nI’d recommend it for night use only, especially fair skins. If you do well with macadamia nut oil, argan, tamanu, olive, hazelnut, sweet almond, apricot, or even coconut, you may do well with sea-buckthorn oil.\n",

Not sure what made me pick it for this week, other than the fact that I feel real guilt about having these soaps just SIT THERE, but I am truly glad I decided to use this soap this week.\n\nI have only used the pastes previously, and I have quite enjoyed them. I agree that the lather from the pastes *feels* different from other soaps, but not sure I can put into words exactly what the difference is. /u/ItchyPooter made an effort, and landed on a rather confusing ode to analingus. I think I will just leave the mystery of the paste's lather to your imaginations. The hard soap feels more familiar. The soap lathers with ease, and creates a dense creamy lather. I started with a dry brush every day this week and only added a bit of water to get an excellent lather. The soap has very good residual slickness, even before you add water while rinsing your face. The soap may not break into the top tier of the very best soaps out there, but so what? It's another very good soap, one that I enjoyed using all week, and frankly that's a huge plus in my books. I agree with /u/BostonPhotoTourist that the hard soap is slicker than the paste. The soap includes macadamia nut oil, argan oil, jojoba oil, black clay, shea butter, and other skin-friendly ingredients.\n\nPost shave - **for me** - is quite good, with very little post shave tightness or dryness. I did not feel the need for a post shave balm, and I used a different post shave option every day this week. Today's choice happens to be the Epsilon Blue, because I love the scent.\n\n**The AP Shave Co \"Gelousy\" gel tip badger brush** made its way to me via /u/dendj55 for an early test and to provide feedback to AP Shave Co, but the timing just happens to work out so that I can in fact do a video review. The knots are made to order for AP Shave Co, as I understand it.\n\nThe knot is super-gelly, with an extremely soft, almost silky face feel. The knot is less dense than the dscosmetic brush I used a few weeks back, and splays open with ease. The knot density allows for very good lather flow-through, and it has more than enough density to splay without collapsing. The knot feels a bit bendy and soft as you move it from side to side, and feels tailor-made for face lathering . I really enjoyed how soft and pliable the knot felt, but if you are looking for a dense knot that really holds its shape, this knot may not be for you. I hope AP Shave Co can keep prices low enough to compete with the other gel tip knots appearing on the market!\n\nThe handle is not the original, but from Leo Frilot, and I have to say I **really** like the simplicity and feel of the handle. Very cool looking acrylic handle, and I confess I am going to be sad to have to ship this brush off to the next person.\n\n**Next week's product line-up** is entirely undecided at the moment, I really don't know what to use next. I know, how hard can it be?? Not to worry, I am sure I will make up my mind before Monday morning. See you all next week!!",

I’m getting over all the new products coming out that are simply plant extracts with no actual well known effective goodies in them, and being super expensive. I’ve noticed in particular an alarming (for me) amount of new products coming out with no niacinamide in the ingredient list. I remember some old products targeted towards brightening the skin containing arbutin, now nearly all the new ones contain some ridiculous plant extract instead (vitamin tree, some sort of citrus, white flowers...)",

This change in the composition of fatty acids parallels a significant increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity. Experimental studies have suggested that omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids elicit divergent effects on body fat gain through mechanisms of adipogenesis, browning of adipose tissue, lipid homeostasis, brain-gut-adipose tissue axis, and most importantly systemic inflammation. Prospective studies clearly show an increase in the risk of obesity as the level of omega-6 fatty acids and the omega-6/omega-3 ratio increase in red blood cell (RBC) membrane phospholipids, whereas high omega-3 RBC membrane phospholipids decrease the risk of obesity. Recent studies in humans show that in addition to absolute amounts of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acid intake, the omega-6/omega-3 ratio plays an important role in increasing the development of obesity via both AA eicosanoid metabolites and hyperactivity of the cannabinoid system, which can be reversed with increased intake of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A balanced omega-6/omega-3 ratio is important for health and in the prevention and management of obesity.

Lowering the LA/ALA ratio in animals prevents overweight and obesity.\n>     \n> -   Omega-6/omega-3 fatty acids compete for their biosynthetic enzymes and because they have distinct physiological and metabolic properties, their balanced omega-6/omega-3 ratio is a critical factor for health throughout the life cycle.\n>     \n> -   Adipose tissue is the main peripheral target organ handling fatty acids, and AA is required for adipocyte differentiation (adipogenesis). The increased LA and AA content of foods has been accompanied by a significant increase in the AA/EPA + DHA ratio within adipose tissue, leading to increased production in AA metabolites, PGI2 which stimulates white adipogenesis and PGF2α which inhibits the browning process, whereas increased consumption of EPA and DHA leads to adipose tissue homeostasis through adipose tissue loss and increased mitochondrial biogenesis.\n>     \n> -   High omega-6 fatty acid intake leads to hyperactivity of endocannabinoid system, whereas omega-3 fatty acids lead to normal homeostasis (decrease hyperactivity).\n>     \n> -   High omega-6 fatty acids increase leptin resistance and insulin resistance, whereas omega-3 fatty acids lead to homeostasis and weight loss.\n>     \n> -   Because a high omega-6/omega-3 ratio is associated with overweight/obesity, whereas a balanced ratio decreases obesity and weight gain, it is essential that every effort is made to decrease the omega-6 fatty acids in the diet, while increasing the omega-3 fatty acid intake. This can be accomplished by (1) changing dietary vegetable oils high in omega-6 fatty acids (corn oil, sunflower, safflower, cottonseed, and soybean oils) to oils high in omega-3s (flax, perilla, chia, rapeseed), and high in monounsaturated oils such as olive oil, macadamia nut oil, hazelnut oil, or the new high monounsaturated sunflower oil; and (2) increasing fish intake to 2–3 times per week, while decreasing meat intake.\n>     \n> -   In clinical investigations and intervention trials it is essential that the background diet is precisely defined in terms of the omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acid content. Because the final concentrations of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids are determined by both dietary intake and endogenous metabolism, it is essential that in all clinical investigations and intervention trials the omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids are precisely determined in the red blood cell membrane phospholipids. In severe obesity drugs and bariatric surgery have been part of treatment.\n>     \n> -   The risk allele rs 1421085 T to C SNV in intron 1 and 2 in the FTO gene functioned similarly to AA metabolites, PGI2 and PGF2a increasing proliferation of white adipose tissue and decreasing its browning respectively, whereas the knockdown of IRX3 and IRX5 genes functioned similarly to omega-3 fatty acid metabolites increasing the browning of white adipose tissue, mitochondrial biogenesis, and thermogenesis. Therefore, further research should include studies on the effects of omega-3 fatty acids in blocking the effects of the risk allele (rs 1421085), which appears to be responsible for the association between the first intron of FTO gene and obesity in humans.\n>     \n> -   In the future studies on genetic variants from GWAS will provide opportunities to precisely treat and prevent obesity by both nutritional and pharmaceutical interventions.\n>     \n> \n> Obesity is a preventable disease that can be treated through proper diet and exercise. A balanced omega-6/omega-3 ratio 1–2/1 is one of the most important dietary factors in the prevention of obesity, along with physical activity. A lower omega-6/omega-3 ratio should be considered in the management of obesity.\n> \n\n---\n\n\nfound here: https://twitter.com/nicknorwitz/status/1345703852595687425",

    "body": "[Video Up](https://youtu.be/XAlI-EqbkVo)  \n\n---\nTallow + Steel (https://tallowandsteel.com) is arguably Canada’s favorite artisan soap maker. They sport a very good soap base and a range of bold and unique scents. Their 2017 reformulation and new scent roll out appears to have been very successful given the amount of times I see their products in shaves of the day photos. While I have reviewed nearly all of their new scents, it is worth mentioning again that T+S remains committed to using premium, organic ingredients and donates a portion of sales to various charities that support each scents theme. Tallow + Steel is also available through Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/).\n \nWest Coast IPA was a limited edition soap run and aimed to evoke the sensation of shaving with popular West Coast style IPA beer. These beers are known for their bitter hoppiness and bright, sharp citrus punch. As such, T+S West Coast IPA features notes of American hops, pine, grapefruit, tangerine, orange and lemon. To my nose, the scent opens with a strong grapefruit note before being met with pine and hops. As with nearly all of the latest scents from T+S, this scent is polarizing. Fortunately, I enjoy this one quite a bit. It truly captures the essence of a fresh poured IPA. Scent strength is strong off the container and becomes mid-strong once lathered. While this scent is very unique, the closest similarities in the wet shaving world I can think of are; Declaration/Chatillon Lux Forth & Pine and Viking Shaving Soap Longship.\n \nThe performance of the reformulated T+S has firmly placed it in the upper echelon of available soap bases. In my experience, the soap loads effortlessly into the brush and lathering is a breeze. The cushion and density the soap produces is good, better than your average artisan soap. The slickness and residual slickness stand very close to the top of the spectrum. The razor’s edge glides effortlessly whether its on my face or my head. The post shave is also near the top of the spectrum as well. My skin is left feeling soft and smooth with no need for a post shave. The ingredients list is stellar, containing Stearic Acid, Water, Organic Glycerin, Potassium Hydroxide, Tallow (Pasture-Raised), Essential Oils, Organic Argan Oil, Organic Pomegranate Seed Oil, Organic Macadamia Nut Oil, Organic Coconut Oil, Organic Avocado Oil, Organic Castor Oil, Bentonite Clay, Organic Tamanu Oil, Vitamin E and silk. This soap base gets a shavescore of 90. This places it in line with high end soaps such as Oleo Soapworks and Australian Private Reserve.  \n\n---\n ****Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, \nsponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.* \n \n* Soap - Tallow + Steel West Coast IPA (PIF)  \n\n* Brush - Declaration B4 on Monzingo Brushworks (loaner)\n\n* Razor -  Arman Blade “Funky Frequency” (purchased)\n\n* Post - Tallow + Steel West Coast IPA (PIF)  \n",

    "body": "I ordered the SKin79 O2 BB Cleanser. It finally came in about 3 days ago. In the past three days of using it, I've already noticed drastic results. \n\nI'm normally *very* oily. I deal with large, clogged pores and lots of sebaceous filaments. Over the years I've tried innumerable cleansers and creams and treatments (some great, some terrible for my skin).  \n\nThis cleanser is pretty interesting and kind of fun to use. It comes out as a gel that you massage onto your dry face. For two minutes, while you leave it alone, it bubbles and foams by itself. It's pretty ticklish and entertaining. After 2 minutes, you massage it back down into your face, rinse with lukewarm water, and pat dry. \n\nI was a little skeptical that it would really cleanse off my makeup, but it actually does an amazing job. My skin feels clean and tight (but not in a bad way). In the past few days, I've noticed a remarkable reduction in oil production (I only have to blot once around midday and I *could* get away with skipping that and embracing the \"healthy glow\" if I wasn't so obsessed with a matte appearance) and my pores appear to be tightening back up, shrinking if you will. I've had no new irritations or breakouts and the ones that were healing appear to be healing a little faster than normal. I use it morning and night and for the first time in my life, when I wake up, my skin isn't oily. I'm all around astounded and I really just needed a place to gush (none of my guy friends really care all that much about the goos I put on my face). \n\nHave any of you tried this or any other Asian cleansers? How did it/they work out for you? Anything anyone knows that I should be worried about using this product (I'm always waiting for something awful to ruin the good things lol)? \n\nUpdate -\n\nIngredients: Water, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Acrylates Copolymer, Cocamide DEA, Methyl Perfluorobutyl Ether, Methyl Perfluoroisobutyl Ether, Ethyl Perfluorobutyl Ether, Ethyl Perfluoroisobutyl Ether, Polyhydroxystearic Acid/Isononyl Isononanoate/Ethylhexyl Isononanoate/Sodium cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium chloride Phosphate, PGE-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Butelyn Glycol, Maackia Faureie Stem Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Vigna Radiata Seed Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Simmondsia Chinensis (jojoba) Seed Oil, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Persea Graitssima (avocado) Oil, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Opuntia Ficus-India Extract, Sansevieria Trifasciata Leaf Extract, Punaca Granatum Fruit Extract, Ficus Carica (fig) Fruit Extract, Morus Alba Fruit Extract, Ginko Biloba Nut Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalus (Rosemary) Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme) Extract, Rose Canina Fruit Extract, Salvia Hispanica Seed Extract, Avena Sativa (Oat) Meal Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Xantham Gum \n\nI know a lot of people cry out against Lavender Oil because they heard it was cytotoxic (I was one of them until I started *reading* about the issue). I'm pretty certain the scare has to do with a misinterpretation of research. Lavender Oil was found to be cytotoxic *in vitro* to endothelium cells (lining the interior of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels) and fibroblasts. A 2005 study states: \"although it was recently reported that lavender oil, and its major constituent linalyl acetate, are toxic to human skin cells in vitro, contact dermatitis to lavender oil appears to occur at only a very low frequency. The relevance of this in vitro toxicity to dermatological application of Lavandula oils remains unclear.\" And in 2007 a team of European researchers testing photosensitivity in relation to lavender oil and sandalwood oil found: \"Lavender oil and sandalwood oil did not induce photohaemolysis in our test system. However, a few reports on photosensitivity reactions due to these substances have been published, e.g. one patient with persistent light reaction and a positive photo-patch test to sandalwood oil.\" So, please, spare me the diatribes about how \"terrible\" Lavender Oil is. I used to give them. And I was as misinformed as anyone else. ",

The soap includes goat's milk and cold-pressed macadamia nut oil, along with argan oil, barbassu oil, and jojoba oil. The paste version is *very* soft and you really just need to press the tips of your brush into the paste to load the soap. The paste is quite concentrated, so be careful not to overload the brush. This soap builds a lather very easily, but watch how much water you start with or you will find the initial lather to be runny and thin. The lather does feel different than other soaps, thinner somehow even though it feels fatty, but not to worry! The lather is wonderfully slick and quite protective, and makes the razor glide effortlessly. The hard soap may be a touch better, and perhaps only so because it feels more like a traditional soap than the paste. This particular formula works very well for me, and the post-shave highlights the benefits of the goat's milk and other skin-friendly ingredients. If you are wondering what this soap smells like, it mostly smells lightly of soap. One more thing to mention: the glass jar is heavy and just feels classy and expensive. I am holding on to it, some other soap will find a happy home there once the \"Pots of Milk\" is gone. When will that be? No idea, but not any time soon.\n\n**The Marvel razor** remains an excellent razor: efficient and comfortable and *easy* to use despite the blade gap. I am not going to recap my feelings about this razor again, but will simply say that I only have one (having given the second one away) and I will soon be buying a second as a backup. What I **really** want is a Marvel in aluminum or stainless steel or titanium…\n\n**The Yaqi convertible brush** with the synthetic knot makes a great travel option, and I am an idiot for not also taking the badger knot with me. Next time!\n\n**The Epsilon \"Blue Mediterranean\" aftershave** remains a favorite - great scent, touch of powder, nice alcohol hit with quick dry-down, and menthol cooling to close it out. I really like this aftershave, and I cannot believe how lucky I am -- a very kind Redditor, /u/CanadaEh97, sent me some samples of the original Floid Blue so now I can compare them side by side! I think I know who might win…\n\n**Next week** I will trying out a brushless cream that can also be lathered, along with an iKon head on loan from another kind Redditor…you are all so generous, it puts me in the mood to do more giveaways!

Tallow + Steel (https://tallowandsteel.com) took an already good soap base and improved on it in every way. They also took time to up their packaging game and come up with an entirely new line of scents. The new scents have been met with two diverse opinions. Many love the new offerings, while the other faction is highly disappointed. I previously reviewed Maya (https://youtu.be/n70MydmnGN4) and Himalya (https://youtu.be/9VfVL2521qU) and was not overly impressed with either scent. Tallow + Steel is also available through Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/).\n \nBoreal is named for the Boreal Forest of Canada. This circumpolar region of the northern hemisphere features a large variety of conifers so it’s no surprise that the soap contains several woody notes. The notes are listed as: Cedar, Fir, Spruce, Birch and Monarda. To my nose the scent opens with a blast of coniferous smells that are indistinguishable as to species. The scent develops into a more resinous accord rather than needles or cones. It is bold and unique among scents that utilize pines/firs and the like. The scent strength is strong off the container but moves to mid-strong once lathered. This scent is in the same realm as Mike’s Natural Pine & Cedarwood and Henri et Victoria Fall's Lumberjack.\n \nThe performance of the reformulated T+S has firmly placed it in the upper echelon of available soap bases. In my experience, the soap loads effortlessly into the brush and lathering is a breeze. The cushion and density the soap produces is good, better than your average artisan soap. The slickness and residual slickness stand very close to the top of the spectrum. The razor’s edge glides effortlessly whether its on my face or my head. The post shave is also near the top of the spectrum as well. My skin is left feeling soft and smooth with no need for a post shave. The ingredients list is stellar, containing Stearic Acid, Water, Organic Glycerin, Potassium Hydroxide, Tallow (Pasture-Raised), Essential Oils, Organic Argan Oil, Organic Pomegranate Seed Oil, Organic Macadamia Nut Oil, Organic Coconut Oil, Organic Avocado Oil, Organic Castor Oil, Bentonite Clay, Organic Tamanu Oil, Vitamin E and silk. This soap base gets a shavescore of 90. This places it in line with high end soaps such as Oleo Soapworks and Ariana & Evans.   \n\n---  \n\n ****Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, \nsponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.* \n \n* Soap - Tallow + Steel Boreal sample (purchased)  \n\n* Brush - Declaration B3 Jefferson (loaner)\n\n* Razor -  Dovo “Bismarck” (gifted) \n\n* Post - Brut (purchased)",

Of course it is possible, you and I know that, but I thought it would be good fun to show just how easy this is with a DE razor. Perfect timing, as I had to travel this week and I have this Monday off. I let my beard grow for a full week. Before anybody else mentions it, yes, I know -- I have a lot of grey hair in my beard.\n\n* Days 1-3: not bad, a bit itchy and very poky.\n* Days 4-5: the itch is building, but the hair is a little softer. I can really see just how much grey beard hair I have. I do not like the way I look and my skin is already starting to show a bit of dryness.\n* Days 6-7: it all comes back to me now - I hate having a beard. The hair feels funny, it already feels a little bit waxy or greasy even after washing, and it really itches under my chin and at the bottom of my neck. I **really** want to shave...\n\nI have not used the Meißner Tremonia \"Himalayan Heights\" shaving paste in quite some time. I chose it at random from a pile of soaps just languishing on the shelf. The scent starts off with a salty tang (Himalayan salts) and then a strong deep cedar scent blossoms (from the Himalayan cedar). The salty tang makes for a unique twist on the more common cedar or woodsy scent, and I really like the combination. If you don't like the smell of salty sea air, skip this soap.\n\nThe soap is a coconut oil soap, with babassu seed oil, macadamia nut oil, and jojoba oil. The soap paste feels whipped, a bit light and mousse-like, and is a very cool blue color. The soap lathers quickly and easily, and can take a fair bit of water. The lather is dense, creamy, and slick and does not dissipate at all during the shave. Some people report that the lather feels dry or not as slick as other soaps, but that is not my experience --**unless** you do not use enough water. The soap rinses very easily and cleanly and leaves a thin, slick residual layer behind. Post shave is excellent. I really feel bad about just having this sit on the shelf, given how good it is -- really a shame that it must languish at the back. Very good soap!\n\nI decided to use up one of the aftershaves that has been similarly languishing, the Meißner Tremonia \"Exotic Elemi\". The aftershave is a mixture of alcohol, witch hazel, glycerin, eucalyptus, with elemi oil and ylang ylang. The scent is meant to capture the Javan jungles of Indonesia. To me, the scent is darkly woodsy, almost a heavy incense scent with a touch of floral and citrus; heavy and a bit heady rather than a cologne-style scent. Actually made for a good pairing, given the woodsy notes in both the soap and the aftershave. Aftershaves that mix alcohol and witch hazel really work well for me, and this one is no exception: a quick hit from the alcohol, toning and cooling from the witch hazel and eucalyptus, and the scent is strong but fades quickly.\n\nIf you have not yet seen it, /u/SoullessSingularity [posted a review of the Exotic Elemi shaving soap here recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/7owg8s/first_impressionmeißner_tremonia_exotic_elemi/)\n\nThe Edwin Jagger DE89 had no issues at all with seven days of growth. DE razors, even \"mild\" razors like the DE89, generally will have very little issue with this much growth. No tugging, no clogging, no spots with lots of missed beard - just a simple clean easy shave! I am really not a fan of this handle, and I should have used another one, but I wanted to keep this shave as generic as possible. If you only shave once a week, do not worry: a DE razor will take your week-long beard off with ease.\n\nThe APShaveCo faux horsehair brush was selected at random: great knot, works up a lather swiftly and easily, feels great on the face with soft tips and good backbone. I really like this knot.\n\nNext week I should be back on track with a more regular shaving soap review, and I am on a self-imposed sabbatical until I have worked through the soaps I have in the queue right now. Disregard the fact I bought something last night, that was a defensive move to stock up on something -- don't judge me, none of you have a *goddamn leg to stand on*.",

The brand is synonymous with quality organic ingredients, bold and daring scents and giving back. A portion of the profits for each one of their soap and aftershave sold, goes to support various charities, of which are decided by the scent and theme of the soap purchased. Tallow + Steel is a Canadian based artisan, with their product being handmade in Winnipeg, Canada. Tallow + Steel is also available through Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/).\n \nMorocco is a scent that harkens to the Atlas Mountains located in the Kingdom of Morocco. Morocco is in the northwest most region of Africa and is known for its famous spice markets, diverse culture and the countries natural beauty. Tallow + Steel has blended Rose, Oakmoss, Cedar, Cade and Cypress with the hope to evoke the thought of walking through a wild rose field on the mountain side. To my nose, this scent is dominated by the smokey cade. It opens with a punch and remains strong and forward. The cypress and cedar compliment the smokiness with earth tones and the rose, unfortunately is relegated to just hints. The scent strength is strong, both off the sample and remains strong once lathered. Soaps with a similar scent profile are: Mike's Natural Soaps Rose & Cedarwood and LA Shaving Soap Co.

I plan to use it twice/thrice a week and work it up slowly to everyday, scaling back if there's any irritation. But with my routine, I'm not sure how to introduce it with minimal 'damage'. My skin type is normal-combo, no acne but there's some PIH. I'm adding tretinoin mainly for anti-ageing purposes. Current routine:\n\n**AM**  \nSplash with water  \nDIY Vitamin C E Ferulic serum (wait 20 minutes)  \nMissha FTE  \nHada Labo Gokujyun Lotion  \nBenton Snail Bee Essence  \nNaruko Taiwan Magnolia Lotion (it's an emulsion)  \nMizon Snail Recovery Gel (if I need the extra moisture)  \nSunscreen (I rotate a few)  \n\n**PM**  \nOCM with mineral/hemp seed/macadamia nut oil  \nHada Labo Gokujyun Foaming Cleanser  \nPaula's Choice BHA 2% then AHA 8% (every other night - wait 20 minutes)  \nMissha FTE  \nHada Labo Gokujyun Lotion  \nBenton Snail Bee Essence  \nMissha Long Name Ampoule  \nSheet mask  \nNaruko Taiwan Magnolia Lotion  \nBenton Snail Bee Steam Cream\n\nOnce a week - Innisfree Jeju Volcanic Pore Clay Mask\n\n**Questions:**  \n1) How do I incorporate the tret in the above routine? At which point?\n\n2) Regarding buffering... How do I do that exactly given the above routine? So there's a few ways to buffer, but not sure how any of them apply to my routine.\n\n3) I will also be stopping the AHA and BHA till my skin is all good with the tret. How do I reintroduce them? Can I reintroduce both at the same time or should I work with one then the other?\n\n4) Should I switch out any existing products? I'm running out of the Mizon gel and will be replacing with Meishoku Ceracolla gel for the ceramides. Anything else I should replace (or drop)?\n\n\n\nAck sorry this turned out to be so long! I've never used retinoids before so I want to be careful. As you can see I have many questions and my derm isn't very helpful :P\n\nThank you all in advance!!\n\n\nEdit: clarification",

\n\nvitamin C (exfoliation, brightening/whitening, acne fighting properties)\n\nAHA(exfoliation, brightening, acne fighting)\n\nBHA( **strong** exfoliation, irritating to skin, removes blackheads and fights acne)\n\n-\n|*1st. make sure PH is ok- use a PH-adjusting toner or wait 20 minutes.*|\n-\n\napply vitamin C and wait 10-20 minutes before applying your other actives( AHA/BHA, retinoids). if you only use vitamin C the rules don't change- you still have to wait min. 10-20 minutes before moving on with your routine. you don't wanna mix the niacinamide from your FTE(see next step) with vitamin C.\n\nvitamin C will only work if you use it regularly. it is a powerful antioxidant and let me tell you, antioxidants are important- they protect your skin from free radicals/damage.\n\nremember, AHAs make your skin super-light-sensitive! you need to wear sunscreen if you use AHAs/BHAs, always! *i forgot* is **not** an option. the same applies to BHAs which are even stronger, they can be a purge to your face, a true armageddon!\n\n---\n\n-\nif you use retinoids(PM):\n\n-\n|wait at least 20 minutes before applying your retinoid if you applied vitamin C/AHA/BHA in the last step.|\n-\n\napply your retinoid.\n\n*now, wait at least 30 minutes- a necessity! please, let the retinoid do its magic.*\n\n----\n\n**AM/PM:** when you're done with your actives apply your preferred FTE- COSRX galactomyces( known as 'white power' FTE) or SK-II *galactomyces* or the Missha *saccharomyces* FTE, or any other FTE. \n\nFTEs contain niacinamide, the product of its precursor, niacin. niacinamide is used by your body to fight redness and aging. aside from PIH-lowering ingredients, FTEs include fermented extracts called saccharomyces or galactomyces, a type of yeast with antioxidative effects. \n\n\n**AM/PM:** this is where you apply (Japan: Toner=Lotion) your favorite *hada*(hydration!) lotion; \n\n**yamano's [kohaku hada] Amber Lotion**- *black* or *red*](which is better than other hadas imo) \n\nor **rohto's [hada labo] Gokujyun Lotion** \n\nor **shiseido's [hada senka] Lotion**\n\nor any other *hada*.\n\n**AM/PM:** now it's time to calm your skin down and give it some juices- this is where you apply essences/serums/ampoules. \n\nessences/serums/ampoules fight conditions, moisture and hydrate skin. they can be used to calm skin after *the purge*(AHAs/BHAs/retinoids).\n\n\n**AM/PM:** gels/emulsion\n\n this is where i use my snail emulsion\n\n**AM/PM:** if you use any facial oils,— and why not?— apply them here. leave on for 5 minutes, remove excess oil with a cleansing pad/towel.\n\n**AM/PM:** moisturizer\n\napply your best moisturizer! some apply it before oils, some after oils. your choice. \n\n**AM/PM:** cream | only, if your skin is still dry, which it probably isn't, if you're young-ish.\n\n**AM/PM:** eye cream / optional, not everybody likes the idea of eye creams\n\n**AM:** sunscreen | there's no way around it, if you include actives such as AHA/BHA/vitamin C, this is a must!!! it does NOT matter if it's a chemical or physical formula- sunscreen comes here.\n\n**AM:** make-up",

I'll go find it.\n\nNow, disclaimer here, I've been using my tazorac for years do my skin is used to it by now. I did buffer for a long time and I do think that retinol is an exception to the actives order in that you can use it also before or after lotions in order to limit irritation. I also will occasionally buffer if my skin is feeling irritated by moving to after my essences but before my lotions or sandwiching it in between two moisturizers. Try it for a few months after the FTE, and if you tolerate it well, slowly incorporate it into your actives section if your routine.\n\nEdit: skin and tonics actually did the order with the retinoid here: http://skinandtonics.com/evening-skin-care-routine/\n\nShe does mention that if this is a OTC product rather than an Rx, you should move your acids to a different routine rather than use them together because it inhibits the conversion of the basic retinol, but because Rx stuff is already in the correct form, it's not necessary to worry about.",

Also be very careful with sheet masks, the wetting/ soaking can act as a penetration enhancer so may increase penetration and thus irritation of the tretinoin.\n\nAs regards buffering IMO experiment with which product you use and therefore at which step you introduce it.\n\nIf the dermatologist is not helpful a pharmacist can be a good source of advice on using prescription medication.",

The artisan offers a standard line of duck fat shaving soaps with a plethora of scent offerings. In addition, the artisan offers limited edition soap runs with different soap formulations, in this case a donkey milk soap offering. While largely under the radar, I have seen this brand popping up more in shaves of the day across different social media platforms. Big thanks to fellow Instagramer @darth\\_razor for sending samples along for review. \n\nThis limited edition MERshaving Donkey Milk Shaving Soap features and orange fougere fragrance. Scent notes are listed as:  Black Amber, Black Pepper, Oak, Bergamont, Orange, Spice, Sandalwood, Oud Wood, and Bourbon. This is a unique take on the idea of fougere and for anyone who enjoys fougere scents, this one is worth checking out. The fragrance is well blended and pulling individuals notes from the accord is not easy. The scent opens with semi-sweet citrus notes and perhaps a hit of sweet bourbon. From their the resinous black amber and oud wood pull the accord back into the earthly realm and it is smoothed out by the creaminess of sandalwood. This is a beautiful scent and quite unique. Mrs. Ruds did not approve, which is expected because of the earthy notes, but I quite enjoy this scent myself. Strength of scent is smack in the middle in terms of strength, both off my sample and once lathered. \n\nMERshaving’s limited edition Donkey Milk Shaving Soap features a unique ingredients list of: Donkey Milk, Pork Lard, Beef Tallow, Stearic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Bison Tallow, Duck Fat, Lamb Tallow, Kokum Butter, Sodium Hydroxide, Shea Butter, Cocoa Butter, Mango Butter, Coconut Oil, Emu Oil, Lanolin, Grape Seed Oil, Avacado Oil, Macadamia Nut Oil, Apricot Oil, Kukui Nut Oil, Walnut Oil, Meadow Foam Oil, Glycerin, Sodium Lactate, Joboba Oil, Castor Oil and Fragrance Oil. The soap is on the softer side of mid and as expected has no issues loading into your brush. The soap is thirsty, but not overly so. When agitated and hydrated the lather takes on the consistency of fresh whipped cream. Slickness is very good in both primary slickness as well as reisdual slickness. Post shave is excellent. I suspect the Donkey Milk plays a large role in the luxurious skin feeling that this post shave affords the user. Given my experience with this soap base, the ShaveScore for MERShaving LE Donkey Milk Shaving Soap is a 89. For a similar performance experience I recommend Oaken Lab or Mammoth Soap. \n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - MERshaving Donkey Milk Shaving Soap (PIF)\n* Brush - ​Simpson’s Chubby 2 Synthetic (purchased)\n* Razor - Wolfman Razors WR2-SB/WRH7 (loaner)\n* Post - Geo F.

The one I got supposedly only has 6g PUFA per 100ml (78g MUFA, 7.5g SFA). \n\n\n\nSo it's basically like olive oil but considerably cheaper. And it's even more favorable when you compare it to the other commonly recommended alternatives that are even pricier, like avocado oil or macadamia nut oil for example.\n\n\n\nI just hope the sunflower taste won't be too noticeable. If it is, I'll just buy a deodorized one next time. But looking forward to trying it tonight. \n\n\n\nAnybody else using it? Or used it at least once and stopped using it? If yes, do you mind sharing why? \n\n\n\nCheers!\n\n\n\nPS: I just opened the bottle and tasted a very small amount. It's completely neutral, both in terms of smell and taste, which is great. I guess it will be great and cheap alternative for making mayo!",

    "body": "So I just discovered that Nivea did the unforgivable crime of reformulating their classic bestseller - their body milk in light blue bottle with Shea butter and almond-y scent. It’s called the Nivea Pampering Soft Milk (VERWÖHNENDE SOFT MILK) in the light blue bottle. it’s also called:\nNivea Smooth Sensation Body Soft Milk or Nivea Smooth Sensation Body Lotion, depending on the country. The formula for all those three names is the same, I’ve checked (after going down this rabbit hole), and the colour of the bottle is the same. \n\nAnd if you are in the US, then the formula for a similarly-looking Nivea body lotion in the light blue bottle (which in the US is called Nivea Shea Nourish Body Lotion) is different from both old and new European formulas for the same product 😩 the old European formula is better, the US formula is much simpler (but should work in a humid climate where people don’t need as much moisture). \n\nback to European formulas:\n\nApparently, they’ve also reformulated their other body milks/body lotions, both in deep blue colour bottle and in the white bottle (which is why those products no longer work for my skin 😩). \n\nThe new formula isn’t as hydrating and occlusive as the old one (even though the new formula claims to give hydration for 72 hours, the old one was better). Basically, the old formula has a richer feel, stays longer on the skin and locks-in moisture better, for longer period of time bc it had stronger occlusives and emollients. But as the result, it was a bit tugging on the skin and took a few minutes to absorb. The new formula absorbs immediately,  is easier to apply but is less hydrating. And it now contains denatured alcohol (at least in the light blue and white bottles). So, if you live high humidity and have normal, combo or slightly dry skin, you probably will be okay with the new formula. But if you live in dry air or have extremely dry skin, then you probably would prefer the old formula. \n\nfor years the old Nivea Body Milk in light blue was my holy grail. Nothing could beat it. Even Lipikar or Vaseline Body Lotion weren’t strong enough for my skin. Nivea was the only lotion that would actually keep my skin moisturised for an entire day, without being too thick, too greasy, too difficult to apply or too slow absorbing. And now it’s gone 😢 \n\nFortunately, you can still find the old formula on Amazon and in some online stores who are still selling the leftover stock. The new formula has words 72 h  on the packaging. The old formula would say 5 in 1, 48 h. The old formula is still officially available in Ghana and some other markets around the world but in EU, UK, Ukraine it seems to be officially discontinued (so only can be found in old stock). \n\nIf you are curious about the formulas, here are all of the them: \n\nThe old European formula for Nivea light blue body milk/lotion: \n\nAqua, Glycerin, C15-19 Alkane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Palmitate, Paraffinum Liquidum, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Glucoside, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Sodium Carbomer, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Linalool, Limonene, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citral, Geraniol, Parfum (this formula should be saved in some museum of skincare and studied by chemists bc it’s so good).\n\nThe new European formula for the same product: \n\nAqua,Glycerin,Alcohol Denat.,Cetearyl Alcohol,Ethylhexyl Cocoate,Glyceryl Stearate SE,Butyrospermum Parkii Butter,Isopropyl Palmitate,Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil,Sodium Hyaluronate,Tocopherol,Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil,Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate,Glyceryl Stearate hydroxypropyl starch phosphate, xanthan gum, ethylhexylglycerine, phenoxyethanol, linalool, limonene, benzyl alcohol, perfume.\n\nThe US version of the product: \n\nWater, Mineral Oil, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, C15-19 Alkane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Dimethicone, Fragrance, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nI’ve also found this version in the Polish market (but they have both the new and the old European formulas, too) - this is one is quite close to the OG formula in terms of the level of hydration and occlusion but less cosmetically-elegant, heavier, waxier, a bit slower to absorb and a bit more difficult to spread: \n\nAqua, Glycerin, C1316 Isoparaffin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Palmitate, Paraffinum Liquidum, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Glucoside, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Sodium Carbomer, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Linalool, Limonene, Hydroxyisohexyl 3Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol, AlphaIsomethyl Ionone, Citral, Geraniol, Parfum.\n\nThe closest thing to the old formula that I’ve found so far is their new Nivea Irresistibly Smooth Body Cream in the light blue jar. The formula is different, slightly less hydrating but close enough. It should be more fast absorbing and easier to apply: \n\nGlycerin, Mineral Oil, Alcohol Denat., Stearyl Alcohol, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Cetyl Alcohol, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Microcrystalline Wax, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, Myristic Acid, Arachidic Acid, Oleic Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Linalool, Limonene, Benzyl Alcohol, Citronellol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, BHT, Fragrance. - \n\nit’s not available in all countries, only in some. \nThe Polish regional variant is also close to the OG body milk formula but is less cosmetically elegant. \n\nSo since I now know these things, I had to share it with you 😂\n\n",

So far I've had to rely on YouTube videos for that, so if you have any advice, send it my way! Thanks!",

After shaving it all off and letting it grow naturally, I noticed definite waves and a few natural curls I've never had before. I was look at Amazon prime deals and saw an Aussie pack for curly hair (Deal of the day for Prime Members: Aussie Curls Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Leave In Conditioner Curl Cream, Curly Hair Products with Coconut Oil, Jojoba Oil & Macadamia Nut Oil 300/225 / 160 ml https://amzn.eu/d/8fKV1Tf) and thought I'd do some research and have a go! The second photo is from 2 days ago and the first is taken half an hour ago after recolouring and having a go with the treatment.\n\nI used the shampoo mostly in roots, used the miracle conditioner and left it for 15-20 minutes before washing out because I wanted to try the cream as well. Towel dried to get rid of excess water and rubbed the curl cream. Left it before drying with a diffuser dryer on cool to almost dry and it's insane! I know I've got to do more treatments before it becomes better but I am absolutely amazed already! Just needed to gush with people who get it!!",

But in wiping them off I realized I'm missing two items but I received two identical mascaras that I didn't order. \n\nMy questions are: How is IPSY with damaged packages and it is normal for swaps of products to happen? I was looking forward to the two missing items and I wish they were more creative than two identical mascaras.

I’m hoping this will help people find relatable experiences, gain insight into what they might experience and can expect on the protocol, and provide a chance for anyone to point out small details which are actually very alarming.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust under a week ago I wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmicdeathfungus/comments/15wcwtu/lets_do_this/), describing my story and background. I discovered this community some time ago and it prompted me to continue my research and gave me hope for more effective solutions to my experience with fungi instead of just immune boosting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy delivery of Black Seed Oil, Oregano Oil, and NAC arrived this week (for anyone looking for a supplier, check out iHerb). I was already using Fennel Oil for brushing my teeth. No nasal spray yet - I’ll explain why below. Additionally, I’m also having walnut oil and macadamia nut oil, both of which have strong antifungal and antimicrobial benefits. Walnut oil offers some powerful antiparasitic benefits which I’m very interested in.   \n\n\nCautionary note: Walnut Oil especially has been found to be associated with improved biofilm growth for bacteria in the gut. The framing of these studies was this is actually a good thing for gut health and your microbiome. The data isn’t clear on how Walnut Oil assists biofilm growth for bacteria outside the gut. However, the benefits of taking this have far outweighed the detriments for me so far. If I notice lacklustre results during the intensive protocol before the maintenance phase I‘ll consider cutting cutting out Walnut Oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mentioned I’m not dosing nasal spray yet. Currently, while brushing my teeth with fennel oil and gargling I can feel this oil in my nose and eyes, even if minutely. I’m also getting some great results in my nose and eyes which I’ll share below. I feel the fennel oil is sufficient for now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDays 1-3  \nNothing much to report for these days. I was feeling suspiciously good, but put that down to psychological effects of starting the protocol. By the end of the 3rd day I was hit with a wave of exhaustion. I went to bed right after work and slept until my alarm, only waking close to midnight for a light meal and reading for about an hour. This is unusual for me.\n\nDays 4-6  \nThis is where it started to get interesting. I’ve had strange discharges along with most of the symptoms described in the protocol. I’ve had roller coaster energy. For a few hours I’m over the moon - less brain fog than I’ve had in years, amazing energy. For the next few hours I’ll feel bloated, sick, and even nauseous, struggling to stay awake. The frequency of these waves doesn’t seem attached to dosage, meals, or physical exertion - the ups and downs come when they come. \n\nSomething else I’ve noticed is ravenous hunger. I feel like I’m starving - not for junk food like a usual craving, just food. Anything will do, I’m just hungry for more. I’m keeping to a diet which is fairly low GI, unprocessed, good lean meats and fresh vegetables in healthy proportions, I’m just finding myself wanting more. I’ve had a few extra meals throughout the week just to curb the hunger and fatigue. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOral Discharge  \nWhile brushing my teeth white flakes were visible in my spit after brushing. I noticed something odd: a small, white “pin head” about a centimetre (\\~1/4 inch) long. The length was thin and flexible, like a piece of string. However the end was a small lump with blood veins running through it. I don’t believe this was food and I’ve never seen anything like this before. I’ve been seeing the white flakes less and have noticed my tongue looks clearer - less white candida growth.\n\nNasal Discharge  \nFrom deep in my right nostril I’ve been blowing out black nodules. They tiny and hard, often breaking under pressure. They’re often bloody or have what looks like fresh blood spots on them. This started lasted over day 3 and 4 and I haven’t noticed anything since. From about day 3 I’ve noticed I’m blowing my nose more frequently and with dirtier discharge. Small black and brown flakes, similar to what I was seeing in my toothpaste.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally, I’m keeping my diet healthy, allowing enough time for sleep, and drinking a lot of fluids. Additionally, I’m supplementing immune boosters. I’m treating this as a kind of purge and clean up, which it is. None of what I mentioned above has left me feeling “sick” – there’s that period after having a bad cold or flu where you’re still quite sick but you’re recovering, you can feel that your body has control over the situation. I understand this is not a clear metric, but this feeling of improved wellness has underpinnned all the ups and downs this entire week. Over the next week I’m hoping for more stable energy and getting into a better rhythm with my protocol routine (I’ve left it a bit late some mornings and evenings).",

        "body": "Great feedback. \n\nFennel oil is crucial in the battle against these fungi. It works beyond the oral cavity due to the properties of a typical EO: molecule size. So the simple act of brushing your teeth is actually flooding your body with these molecules, which for me provides an invigorating effect in the morning. A boost of energy and clarity as the fennel does its job. \n\nThe nasal spray will also help since it directly breaks down any biofilm layers from the outside in, which accumulate daily. I've moved on to my own form of Xlear since it is costly, which is something we actively try to circumvent. We went through a period of replicating the Xlear recipe (based on known info and patents) and first came up with a 1:1 replica that costs only pennies to make. Then I moved on to improving the formula for the more 'hardcore' among us and developed what I call Metatron Mist. I'm not sure if I've posted it on Reddit yet, but if there is interest I can do so. \n\nI'm babbling now. I look forward to your future feedback, friend. Keep us updated.",

Sorry if it's information overload, I just want to address any questions so I can get some recommendations and maybe some advice :)\n\n\nThis will be my 3rd attempt at no poo. I've always had an issue with it because I have either eczema, psoriasis, or sebhorreic dermatitis on my scalp. Doctors can never figure out which one it is. Anyways, transition phase always subsides within a month, and my hair becomes luscious and beautiful, but no matter what I do, my scalp ends up itching and burning like crazy. I can't stand it! I always give up because honestly it's just too much to handle. Ive done BS and ACV, cowashing, making my own shampoo from honey and aloe, etc., but my scalp always ends up itchy and painful :(\n\nI'd like to give it another go, because despite how uncomfortable I always was, my hair was always manageable and didn't look dried out and frizzy like it does now. But I have to be wary of coconut oil because it only exacerbates my condition (which sucks because it's so beneficial for hair).\n\nSo, long story short, does anyone have any recommendations or know of any brands that don't use coconut oil in their shampoo bars? Or any recommendations of what can help me sooth my scalp? I heard good things about macadamia nut oil, but I want to do more research. \n\nTL;DR: I have eczema/psoriasis/sebhorreic dermatitis on my scalp and I'm looking for recommendations for a shampoo bar. \n\nPS: Sorry if my sentences are jumbled or repetitive, it's 2am and I'm running on only 4 hours of sleep, haha.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n******UPDATE******\nI went and bought the Changrin Valley Olive Oil and Babadassu (sp?) shampoo bar and I will never use anything else!!! Usually, if I don't shampoo my hair for a day, my scalp itches like crazy, but I went 2 days without shampooing my hair and my scalp felt so nice and even fresh! No itchiness at all! And even better, my hair is so soft! I just lather up the bar, use an ACV rinse, and when my hair is damp I put a little Jojoba oil on the ends of my hair so my strands stay nice and hydrated.

He went on to develop our brand to give men access to great quality skin care that is specially formulated for men’s skin. \n\nThe skin care stuff you find in big box stores (and your partner’s bathroom cabinet) is usually formulated to work for women’s skin, not men’s. [Men’s skin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6116811/) is thicker and rougher than women’s skin, and has the ability to grow facial hair. Our skin has different needs, and we need products that address them. \n\nUsing a daily moisturizer is important for every skin type, and if you use the right one, you can get clearer, healthier, and softer skin just by rubbing it on your face twice a day. \n\nWe’ll tell you why you need a moisturizer for men, what ingredients work best for hydrating men’s skin, and how you can fit a moisturizer into your skin care routine (or, you know, start using a skin care routine with a moisturizer). \n\n## Why You Should Use Face Moisturizer for Men\n\nIf your ashy, dry skin hasn’t convinced you that a moisturizer is probably a good idea, we can give you a few other reasons you may not have considered. \n\n### Men’s Skin Needs Moisture\n\nYou might drink plenty of water, but your skin gets it last. It can be impossible to keep your skin hydrated with drinking water alone. Even though your skin is the largest organ of your body, it’s dead last in line when for hydration. Your other organs take priority so the water you drink gets delivered to your skin last. \n\nEven if your skin is oily, you still need a moisturizer. In fact, your skin could be oily as a result of being dehydrated. When your skin is dehydrated, the sebaceous glands in your skin are triggered to produce more sebum (the oil that keeps your face moisturized and protected). This can make your skin oily all over or in places like your forehead, nose, and chin. \n\n### You Need Help With Blemishes\n\nYou may have thought your days of being a pimple-faced teen were over, but here you are, thirty-something with continual breakouts. What gives? It [could be hormones](https://letsdisco.com/blogs/mens-skin-care-grooming/blemish-prone-skin), it could be genetics, or it could be bad skin care habits. \n\nIf you aren’t moisturizing your skin, you can develop breakouts from an overproduction of sebum (see above). The sebum mixes with dead skin cells and clogs pores, which can cause blemishes to form. \n\nSkin that isn’t properly moisturized can become dry and irritated, which can set the scene for breakouts to happen. Using a moisturizer with blemish-fighting ingredients is one of the best ways to get your skin under control. \n\n### Moisturizers Help You Look Younger\n\nYou may not be in search of the fountain of youth yet, but trust us, sometime in your late thirties you’ll begin to notice the signs of aging on your skin. \n\nFine lines and wrinkles begin to form around your eyes and the corners of your mouth. As you age, the structures in your skin that support it begin to weaken, causing your skin to sag. You’ll also begin to produce less collagen and elastin, the materials that keep your skin looking firm, tight, and youthful. \n\nMoisturizers not only deliver hydration to keep lines and wrinkles filled out, but they also contain powerful anti-aging ingredients that help boost your skin’s collagen and elastin production and help prevent wrinkles from forming before they start. \n\n### Moisturizer Protect Against Free Radical Damage\n\nFree radical damage happens when unbalance molecules called free radicals attack your healthy skin cells. The damage to your cells shows up on your skin as fine lines, wrinkles, hyperpigmentation or “age spots,” and loss of elasticity.\n\nYour skin needs antioxidants to fight off free radicals, and one of the best ways to get antioxidants into your skin is by using a moisturizer packed with antioxidant ingredients. Antioxidants offer protection to your healthy cells by neutralizing oxidative damage so your skin stays healthier and looks more youthful for longer. \n\n## What Ingredients Work Best for Moisturizers for Men\n\nNo, that hand lotion you’ve had stuffed in the back of your cabinets for a few years isn’t the best stuff for your face. Effective moisturizers contain ingredients that target specific skin issues, like aging, lack of hydration, and free radical damage. \n\nHere’s our list of favorite ingredients to look for in a moisturizer for men.\n\n### Vitamin E\n\nThere’s a reason your last date pulled away when you tried to move in for the kiss-your skin is rough as sandpaper, man. The solution? [Vitamin E](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4976416/).\n\nVitamin E is an all-natural emollient, which means it helps condition your skin and keep it soft and touchable. When applied to the skin, it fills in dry, scratchy patches, deep wrinkles, and fine lines, leaving your skin’s texture smoother.\n\nVitamin E is also a powerful antioxidant, which makes it a great ingredient for a moisturizer you’ll apply just before starting your day. It helps fight off damage from external stressors like the sun, pollution, smoke, and other irritants that can make skin look dull.\n\n### Macadamia Oil\n\nThe most coveted nut in the trail mix yields an incredibly powerful oil that is next level hydrating for your skin. \n\nMacadamia oil is all-natural and plant-based, and generally well tolerated by all skin types, so you don’t have to worry about it causing a breakout. This oil helps drastically reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles while deeply moisturizing skin to keep it hydrated all day. \n\nMacadamia nut oil is a lightweight oil and absorbs quickly, keeping your skin soft, moisturized, and comfortable all day. \n\n### Vitamin C\n\nLike a big glass of orange juice for your skin, vitamin C is a powerhouse ingredient for moisturizers because it has so many skin-beneficial functions. \n\nVitamin C helps keep your skin moisturized by preventing [transepidermal water loss](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3673383/). Transepidermal water loss happens when moisture from the middle layer of your skin (the dermis) passes through to the epidermis (the top layer) and evaporates from your skin. \n\nVitamin C also helps to brighten your skin and improve your skin tone. It’s incredibly beneficial for use under the eyes, where dark circles can develop. Vitamin C is a natural dark spot corrector, with the ability to fade areas of hyperpigmentation. \n\n## How to Get Started with a Moisturizer for Men\n\nIt’s not hard to get started with a moisturizer, or a [good skin care routine](https://letsdisco.com/blogs/mens-skin-care-grooming/how-to-make-a-skin-care-routine-for-men), if you don’t yet have one.  Skin care is self care, and it’s important to take care of your face so you don’t end up looking like a washed-up rock star. \n\nIt’s easy to adopt a skin care routine that’s flexible and targets specific skin issues. Here’s everything you need to create a basic skin care routine, including a great moisturizer that will keep your face hydrated day and night. \n\n### Wash\n\nSoap and water aren’t cutting it anymore. You need a face cleanser that removes dirt and oil and leaves your skin hydrated instead of stripping it of natural moisture. \n\nDisco’s charcoal [face cleanser stick](https://letsdisco.com/products/face-cleanser-stick) contains natural ingredients that effectively deep dive into your pores to remove dirt and gunk, while still keeping your skin smooth and soft. \n\n### Exfoliate\n\nExfoliating your skin keeps dead skin cells off your face and helps encourage collagen production. Exfoliating helps set you up for a super close shave and can also help prevent razor burn and bumps. \n\nOur [exfoliating facial scrub](https://letsdisco.com/products/face-scrub) contains papaya, an all-natural exfoliant that lifts away dead skin cells and aloe to keep your skin from becoming dry and irritated. \n\n### Moisturize\n\nYou need a great daily moisturizer that’s good for day and night, and lucky for you Disco’s got it. Our [hydrating facial moisturizer](https://letsdisco.com/products/face-moisturizer) contains all of our favorite ingredients to help your skin look as sexy as possible. \n\nWe also include eucalyptus oil and chamomile in our moisturizer, two ingredients that help boost your skin’s natural moisturizing capabilities. \n\nOur moisturizer is lightweight and absorbs quickly, so you can hydrate and hit the door to start your day. \n\n## Let’s Disco\n\nStop saying men don’t need moisturizers (or skin care) and get the products you need to keep your skin looking sexy and youthful. Disco is the solution for men’s skin care that works, without a bunch of unnecessary filler ingredients you don’t want or need. \n\nSources:\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6116811/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6116811/) \n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3673383/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3673383/)\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4976416/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4976416/)",

I don't eat *too* much of it, tho. Maybe 2~3tbsp daily. \n\n* Macadamia nut oil:\n\n*Very* low PUFA (1~3%), and LOADED with omega 7 (pretty much the best source, even better than sea buckthorn berry oil) \n\nSO good for skin health. \n\nI eat a few teaspoons daily. \n\n* Organic Raw Ivory Food-Grade West African Shea Butter:\n\nVery low PUFA and TONS of stearic acid (50%~!) (the whiter, the less PUFA) and comes with some VERY interesting compounds in it, like triterpenes and some rare antioxidants.\n\nThese triterpenes, sterols, phenolics, antioxidants, and other minor compounds (such as allantoin, squalene, and cinnamic acid) are prebiotic, gently antimicrobial, and encourage a healthy microbiome. \n\nShea's unsaponifiables can range 4–11%, which is massive—compare to <1% in many oils. Quite a few things here in shea butter you won't find anywhere else. \n\nI just ate it for the first time today, 2tsp. It has a rich, nutty, *almost* burnt aroma. *Lovely* flavor when emulsified in a milkshake.\n\nI went back to add more when I first tasted it. \n\nLike my body wanted more immediately, even tho I had never tried it in my life. I will probably eat more of this one than 2tsp daily. \n\n* Grassfed Butter:\n\nAmazing pentadecanoic acid and butyrate source. Meh fatty acid profile, otherwise. \n\nI eat a few tablespoons of this daily.\n\n* Black Seed Oil\n\nOne of the ONLY seed oils worth consuming (due to its potent bioactive substances). Just one tsp a day is only like 1~2g linoleic acid, nothing *insane*—the amount you get from 2 pounds of 90/10 grassfed beef. \n\nAnd just one tsp a day can really KNOCK out a broad range of chronic inflammation for some people, mostly due to the thymoquinone (TQ), but also due to the dozens of active compounds in black seed oil. \n\nI avoid this one for now, tho. I know I will reintroduce it one day, when I've depleted my linoleic acid more. Really seemed to help my dad.",

    "body": "Alright y'all, we had a mushroom martini thread 17 days ago. Lots of people doubted me, and lots of people tried to convince me to pursue mushroom with whiskey or mushroom gin with sweet vermouth. I want you to know respectfully y'all were WRONG (maybe) and I'm humbly claiming the win on the mushroom martini front... and here's how I did it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ez9g9rh3421e1.png?width=2984&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fe21baaadfb9dc6117ab1aea4a385e485286c9f\n\n**Left: mushroom martini**\n\n* 2 oz mushroom-infused Roku gin\n* 1 oz Dolin dry vermouth\n* .5 oz pickled shiitake mushroom brine\n* 2-3 dashes thyme tincture\n\nI infused the Roku gin with 2% by weight each dried hen of the woods and dried black trumpet mushrooms for 12 hours. The pickled mushrooms were blanched 2 minutes in water and then covered in a hot brine of 1/2 cup rice vinegar, 2 cup water, 1 Tbsp Diamond crystal kosher salt, 1 Tbsp cane sugar, 1 tsp sesame seeds with a clove of garlic. The thyme tincture was made with 2 oz vodka and 1/2 tsp dried thyme for 2 hours. I garnished with one of the pickled shiitakes. (They are delicious!)\n\n**Tasting notes:** \n\nWoodsy, herbal and slight vinegar aroma. Briny and a little tart with a bold earthy and fresh mushroom flavor and a subtle savory herbality. Clean and easy drinking. The vermouth is inconspicuous and supports the fullness of the drink without truly adding any sweetness while the Roku was a great canvas for fresh mushroom flavor. I don't regret using a vinegar brine on my shiitakes. Excellent and I WOULD order this, it is the clear winner imo.\n\n**Right: mushroom martinez**\n\n* 2 oz mushroom-infused Ransom barrel-aged Old Tom gin\n* 1 oz Osborne \"medium (amontillado)\" sherry\n* 1 barspon Aalborg Taffel akvavit\n* 1 dash each Peychaud's and Regan's orange bitters\n* 2 drops 20% saline solution\n\nI roasted 8 oz of whole baby bella mushrooms in macadamia nut oil (instead of butter; many of you protested at butter) at 400F for about 25 minutes. I then infused the Ransom gin with 4% by weight each dried hen of the woods, dried black trumpet, and dried porcini mushrooms, plus one roasted mushroom and the mushroom drippings + oil (about 1 oz drippings/oil into 8 oz gin). I meant for 48 hours but I was really lazy and it was more like 3-4 days. The macadamia oil would not freeze out completely (WEIRD) so the martinez is a little oily but I ain't mad at it. I garnished with one of the roasted mushrooms.\n\n**Tasting notes:**\n\nSavory-orange aroma. Rich and oily mouthfeel with a meaty, roasted mushroom flavor and big nutty, oxidized flavors from the sherry. Tangy and herbal from gin and caraway. Complex, savory and full-flavored, punchy -- but with a tiny bit of an out-of-place fruit-sweetness. The Ransom Old Tom was a good fit and smelled so mushroomy on its own. Would I order one knowing what it's like? No, probably not, but I'm glad I tried. I struggled coming up with something to replace the maraschino.\n\nIf I were to try this one again (and I probably will, and I'll update if I do) I'd stick with a Gin and It riff: drop the akvavit, and split out some of the sherry for traditional sweet vermouth as the sherry is quite strong. Maybe I'd have tried Ancho Reyes to dress up the sherry. Let me know if any of y'all try.",

For example, eating rice doesn't flair up Seb Derm but eating the same amount of carbs from sources like Wheat, Oats, Barley and Rye will flair up Seb Derm.\n\nTo tackle this, I find it easier to simply cut out all foods except Rice then add foods to see if I'm intolerant.\n\nAs for curing Seb Derm: I think curing Seb Derm is like \"curing\" obesity - you manage your lifestyle so that every day, you lose more and more weight and eventually you'll be slim. It's the same with Seb Derm. You manage it and it gets better and better to the point where it's gone. People do grow their hair back, they do heal the sores and scaling but it takes time. The body can't heal overnight.\n\nAlso, just because of how many people have mentioned it to me, I would recommend a blood test for things like Vitamin D deficiency. B vitamin deficiency also might influence the condition. It's best to consult a doctor about changing your diet or lifestyle.",

        "body": "So based on cooking alone specifically I’d actually recommend coconut oil instead of macadamia. Coconut oil is like the most nutritious oil out there to ingest it’s antibacterial, anti fungal, anti parasitic genuinely a lot of sciences to back this up compared to average extra virgin olive oil which is also still amazingly good as long as it’s extra virgin and has a date that it was pressed by or doesn’t include filler you don’t know about! However if we’re going based on nut that isn’t coconut to ingest I’d recommend almond oil way more so than macadamia way more nutritious! \n\nAs for body and face and hair: for everything avocado oil, macadamia and almond oil all the way I’d stay away from coconut oil unless it’s in a body wash or shampoo like form as it’s not very comedogenic (meaning it blocks pores) however as a wash being it’s only one for 2 minutes or so you can still reap a lot of benefits if you’re aiming to leave an oil on rubbed in with a lotion for sure try any of those three! If it’s for a wash coconut and things like tea tree oil, rosemary oil are amazing! I would not recommend leaving it on over night as a leave in conditioner but more as a hair mask that you wash off after a while as it can make your scalp itchy or irritated because it’s actually quite acidic with lot’s of bha’s and aha’s however is great for protecting disinfecting from bacteria’s and adding moisture to hair as a result of adding that protective layer and retaining the moisture as it’s so comedogenic 4/5 on the scale. Great for thick curly hair and silky smoothness :)!",

    "body": "Let's find out!\n\n[From left to right, sorted roughly by increasing intrinsic colour: high-oleic sunflower oil | macadamia nut oil | high-oleic safflower oil | camellia \\(tea seed\\) | EVOO stearin | pomace olive oil | high-oleic canola oil | EVOO olein | rice bran oil](https://preview.redd.it/6pklkig7f5s81.jpg?width=2400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48d37487dee01cd832ed635c99c24dbf1ca49143)\n\nSince I am also a very lazy person, I have avoided the use (and the subsequent cleaning) of a stick blender. I employed the [ZNSC recipe](https://www.soapmakingforum.com/threads/zanys-no-slime-castile.72620/), that is 1:1.7 lye, with a solution of 17 g/L of each baking soda and table salt, as the liquid. On top of this, two slight adaptions: first, another 1%TOW of citric acid (as a chelator), and secondly, what I refer to as **ZNSC-50**:\n\n* Do *not* prepare the lye in one piece, but sub-divide it into 1:1 lye masterbatch (which I happen to have at hand anyway), and the sodium chloride/carbonate/citrate dissolved in the excess 70% of water.\n* Then combine the measured amount of lye masterbatch with *just its weight in oil*. This is about a third of the final amount of oil. Stir thoroughly with a spatula, and watch how it is evolving. Since both the lye concentration and proprtion is much increased relative to normal soap batter, it reacts much faster, and overcomes the notoroius laziness of highy oleic oil blends.\n* Only when this pre-batter has reached stable medium-thick trace, add the remaining oils and the salt water (I haven't still found out which order is best). This will considerably thin down the batter, but if done right, trace still doesn't lose its “bite”, and a batter that wouldn't even reach stable emulsion overnight, might be ready to pour after less than one hour. Finally, I stirred in some colour pigments (to practice/have fun with swirling, but also to distinguish the final soaps).\n\nOther noteworthy/surprising things:\n\n* I used an ice cube mould (silicone). All soaps were prepared, let react for 1 to 3 days, and then subject to an (emergency) CPOP at 70°C overnight. Cutting (wrinkle cutter) was done after another week, and of various success (some were still very soft, others already crumbled a bit).\n* I had used unrefined macadamia oil before. When it is added to the oil blend at a substantial proportion, the batter takes on a weird pink colour, which survives saponification, hence pale/white/transparent soaps (both bar soap and liquid soap) are not possible with it. Now I had bought a small portion of refined macadamia oil to test if the weird pink colour prevails. It doesn't. The batter still has a dirty, pinkish-brown colour, but the resultant soap, in fact, it is among the lightest coloured of this survey.\n* Speed-wise, most of the oils demand an exceptional amount of patience. Two exceptions: The RBO accelerated badly, to a point where it was hardly possible to scoop the batter out of the stirring pot. You see the texturing of the swirl. Second: in accordance with various (but not all) reports, the pomace OO also was quite quickly-moving. By far not as bad as the RBO, but still I felt no need for any tricks at all. Clearly, the ZNSC-50 protocol is not made for these two oils.\n* The RBO is kind of an experiment. RBO is the lowest-oleic of these oils, and I usually classify it not as a “castile” oil, but somewhere in between a “luxury” oil (fair amount of linoleic acid and unsaponifiables) and a hard oil (substantial amount of palmitic acid). Some people are successfully using high percentages of RBO in soap, others avoid more than some 20% due to respect from rancidity. I somehow am in between; the RBO part of this series is not only about the Castile performance (hardness, slime, bubbles, skin feel, solubility/longevity), but also an experiment to challenge the boundaries of my DOS comfort zone.\n* What's with that EVOO stearin/olein? Well, over the last months, I have **winterized** olive oil, i. e. kept it cool (around 10°C±5°C) so that higher-melting portions precipitate out (to be filtered off as *stearin*) and the resultant oil stays fully liquid and clear even at fridge temperatures (*olein*). Some triglycerides enrich in the precipitate, others in the liquid, so the composition is slightly different between these fractions, hence the soap might behave differently (hardness, sliminess etc.). Let's find out!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Swirls!](https://preview.redd.it/e8gbmqchg5s81.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d13578622412c20f5f1ff97178db370183adbb7)\n\nI'll keep you updated about the progress of hardening up, sink test, DOS if necessary, etc.!",

She gave the product 6 stars out of 7. The product has a total 5 out of 7 stars on cosme.net with 512 reviews. It's ranked 2nd on cosme.net under the Gel/Cream Eyeshadow category.\n\n>I bought the limited edition color Sheer Apricot.\n>This eyeshadow has 2 colors (2 textures??), a cream and a powder.\n>It's described as a combination of an adhesive gel cream and a fit powder for shading.\n>Maquillage had a similar one a while ago that came with an applicator that I really liked.\n>Looking at it, it stands out because it's small and easy to carry and the packaging is cute ♪\n\n>When you apply the cream, it glides on really easily and has a smooth texture.\n>You can use this as a base too, which saves time.\n>(I always use a base under my eyeshadows)\n>The powder has an interesting consistency! It's really moist when you touch it with your finger.\n>What is this? I wonder if there are a lot of moisturizing ingredients in it.\n>Because usually powders fly all over the place.\n>This isn't like that at all so it can go straight from your fingertip to your eyelid without making a mess.\n>It's wonderful not having any fallout!!\n>Please test out this moist powder for yourself. Lol\n\n>It's a pretty light, yellow-based color so I was worried if it would show up at all. \n>But as you can see from the pictures, it is conservative, but it creates a beautiful nude eye look! (in my opinion lol)\n>And it's sheer. It really has that \"transparency\" that's so trendy right now. LOL\n>Conservative and elegant are the perfect words to describe it. But it's so beautiful when you glance down ♪\n>It's so glossy, as if it's wet.\n>It's perfect for when you want to subtly emphasize your eyes ♪\n>Like when you want your lip color to be the focus.\n\n>Since the base color is a cream, the shadow doesn't crease or fade.\n>Furthermore, this product is waterproof!! I was so surprised!!\n>I really like Integrate products lately.\n>They're reasonably priced and excellent quality.\n>As to be expected from Shiseido.\n\n>This doesn't come with an applicator so I use my finger, but because it's so small I feel like it'll be hard to use up the last of the product. Even if it costs 100 yen more, I think it'd be nice if there was an applicator included for the cream. (Like that Maquillage product I mentioned ♪)\n\n>But it's really an excellent eyeshadow.\n>I want to try the other colors, too!\n\n>PIC [1](http://cdn-cosme.net/media/collection/209/729/4516197_wl.jpg), [2](http://cdn-cosme.net/media/collection/209/729/4516196_wl.jpg)\n\nI also translated the ingredients list from the [official website](http://www.shiseido.co.jp/sw/products/SWFG070410.seam?shohin_pl_c_cd=669901):\nMETHYL TRIMETHICONE, TRIMETHYLSILOXYSILICATE, CERESIN, DIPHENYLSILOXY PHENYL TRIMETHICONE, SILICA, CALCIUM ALUMINUM BOROSILICATE, ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE, DIISOSTEARYL MALATE, DISTEARDIMONIUM HECTORITE, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, PEG-10 DIMETHICONE, MACADAMIA INTEGRIFOLIA SEED OIL, TOCOPHEROL, TIN OXIDE, ALUMINUM HYDROXIDE, METHYLPARABEN, MICA, TITANIUM DIOXIDE, SYNTHETIC FLUORPHLOGOPITE, IRON OXIDES\n\nThis color is so pretty!

This is not meant to offend anybody BTW... if there's some people on hear making soaps down under then give me a buzz and I'll definitely order some of your produce.  \n  \nAnyhow, I'm keen to start making my own soaps. Right now I can make a 'soap' using heavy oils and lye, but not really a 'shaving soap'. Also, I know absolutely nothing about mixing scents (so the soaps I've made smell a lot like toilet cleaner).  \n  \nCan anybody provide some tips on how I might go about improving my skills in regard to soap making and scent making?  \n  \nMy current thoughts are:  \n- The right soap mix will come through practice, I can keep experimenting until I'm happy.  \n- For scents I can start by doing a couple of classic 'pure' scents (e.g. sandalwood and lavender), a couple of classic mixtures (a bay rum and classic barbershop) plus some kind of signature scent (maybe an Australian mix such as a soap with macadamia nut oil and some native essences such as lemon myrtle and ironbark).  \n  \nWhile I'm clearly nowhere near ready to sell anything, is this a worthy cause? Also, is it realistic that I could learn how to make some decent soaps within a year if I'm committed? I think it could be fun, and the current exchange rate could also offer some bargain prices for people in the USA (even when you factor in shipping).  ",

Learn how to use it to your advantage as the performance of a shaving soap formula relies greatly on the fatty acid makeup of the oils you are using where the post shave feel of the formula relies on the unsaponified content of the soap.\n\nIf you do not enjoy the process of soapmaking this is not the right way to go.  Marketing, promotion, research, post production, shipping, receiving, accounting, etc can all become a gigantic life suck so you have to be able to deride enjoyment at least from the creation process.\n\nPerfumery is a tricky process.  There are plenty of textbooks, various websites with information, groups on Facebook, the Basenotes forums, and existing products to draw inspiration from.\n\nI realize I was rambling a bit but starting a business where you manufacture what you sell in house is a tricky process and truly is a labor of love.

    "body": "Hey folks,\n\nI started the Last Mile on January 3rd and have been running ultra-consistent on the diet plan since then, PAGG stack per normal, started the Couch to 5K cardio regimen (done 4 days so far...a little less than I should), and reduced my weight training to push-ups and kettlebell swings once or twice a week.  I'm 32 y/o male, 5'6\", started at 159.5 lbs coming off a three-day bender for New Years (oops).\n\nIn 11 days I've accomplished the following:\n\n* Lost 4.5 lbs\n* Shaved off about 1% of body fat (18.7% now with in-home calipers)\n* Noticed a little blip in inches lost on my thighs (around 1/2 inch)\n\n**Meal plan:**\n\n* 5 eggs for breakfast (scrambled in 1 tsp of Macadamia Nut oil)\n* 4 oz Lean Chicken Breast and 1/4 cup of almonds for morning/afternoon meals at work\n* 50 grams Whey protein shake in water and 1/4 cup of almonds for lunch\n* 4 oz lean flank steak, kale/spinach salad with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and a can of asparagus for dinner\n* 50 grams Casein protein shake in water right before bed (sometimes with an almond snack about 8pm)\n* Coffee with Splenda and a bit of cinnamon; iced tea with Splenda; at least a gallon of water a day (tried to wean myself from the sweetner)\n\nI tried boiled eggs for a few days, but the prep was driving me crazy when I can just scramble the eggs every morning in about 3 minutes!  Tried a lean tuna steak for dinner one night but I'm not a big fish fan and it left me feeling unsatisfied.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n* This is hardcore keto, you should be practiced in low-carb before you attempt this\n* On Day 4 I experienced horrendous Keto Flu for the first time ever (even since Atkins Induction way back in the day)\n* A can of Swanson Chicken Broth will cure most of what ails you (including the Keto Flu!) during a bad spell\n* I feel REALLY energetic the day after a workout (once I get over the initial morning hangover)\n* On non-exercise days, the mental fog can be killer; I've noticed myself forgetting simple things (like technology acronyms) or incorrectly pronouncing certain words!\n* Even with the kale and spinach salads, constipation is still a bit of an issue\n* I'm taking plenty of supplements (multi, Vitamin E, Calcium, Mg, K, PAGG stack) but my Potassium seems to still be a little low\n* I'm pretty much exhausted all the time; I can summon the energy to do my job and the 5K cardio program, but strength training takes all I've got; I'm not even sure I may not be pushing it too much; I've yet to do two strength sessions and three cardio sessions in one week so far due to energy issues\n* I noticed on Day 9 that my urine was becoming very clear (instead of the signature bright yellow when in keto!) and I suspect that after two days of no exercise I slipped out of keto even though I was still on the diet; Not sure if this is the case but it could be that at this weight and program the exercise portion is going to have to be huge factor to keep the weight-loss going; the day after I ran again the color returned to normal keto\n\nOverall, I think this is sustainable if you plan it right and stick with it.  Bad news is, I'm headed to Vegas for the three day weekend and that'll be a setback (I'll try to stick to keto, but you know how it goes!).  But I'm coming back home to the same plan next Tuesday and will press on from there.\n\nBUT, I now weigh 155lbs and even some of my 32 inch jeans/suits are feeling a little baggy!  I probably haven't weighed this much since I was 18!  I'd love to drop this to around 15% body fat and then maybe switch it up for P90X or something similar...\n\nThoughts?  Comments?  Suggestions?  See anything I'm doing wrong?\n\nThanks everyone and keto on!",

I figured it was buckwheat, but now I am not so sure. \n\nAnywho, I thought I would get fancy and wanted to try infusing the grains with a bit of coconut, macadamia nut, and pandan flavor.\n\nTo do this, I combined a few recipes, but my steps were as follows:\n\n* Toasted 1 cup of buckwheat in a nonstick pan for 6 minutes, a little below medium heat.\n* 2 minutes on low heat with a pinch of macadamia nut oil.\n* Combine 2 cups of water, a tablespoon of macadamia nut oil, a pinch of full-fat coconut milk, and pandan powder in a rice cooker.\n* I was in a rush, so I put the pot for a rice cooker on a stainless steel pan and got it to a boil that way, then placed it in the rice cooker until it decided it was finished.\n\nMy big surprise was how fast it cooked. I didn't even notice it was boiling on the stove till I looked over and suddenly all the grains had poofed up.\n\nThe result had somewhat of the flavor I wanted. The big issue was the texture. Very mushy, no plump sensation, grainy sensation.\n\nI would love to do this better next time. The question is, should I have been using a different grain? Should I have rinsed it even though I was toasting it? If I rinsed it before or after toasting? Did I over toast it?\n\n[Image can be found here.](https://postimg.cc/BX1N2vC0)",

Learn how to make something properly, then play around with it when you know you're actually starting from a solid foundation.\n\nAs for the technical side of things your method for preparing the buckwheat has a number of issues.\n\nHere's a general method for you to follow:\n\nRinse the buckwheat by agitating in cold water and strain.\n\nToast the drained buckwheat in a tbsp or so of oil for 2-3 mins over medium high heat until it's properly toasted and smells nutty. Remove and set aside.\n\nBring water to a boil at a 2:1 ratio for your volume of buckwheat (ie 2 cups of water for 1 cup of buckwheat).\n\nOnce the water is boiling, add the toasted buckwheat and drop the heating to medium, and cover with a lid. Let it simmer for 15 minutes.\n\nKill the heat and then let it sit for another 15-20 minutes to fully absorb the water.\n\nYour primary mistake was bringing the buckwheat to a boil instead of adding it to boiling water, and then putting it into a rice cooker which continued to boil it even further.",

I was always told that my hair had to be straightened first in order for the ends to be cut off, which doesn't make sense when you're adding so much heat to hair. In addition, the stylists trimmed too much and in a way that stunted growth for years and years. My hair is finally thicker and longer, but I'm trying to grow it out more in a healthy way. I know I should probably get a big chop but I would rather do a small trim (.5-1 inch) every month over time. I have looked at devacurl salons near me but a lot of them only show photos of White clients with wavy type 2 something hair. I am looking to find someone who knows 3 and 4 type hair who is going to trim my hair while it's dry or wet without cutting too much (my hair shrinks 50% of its current length). What questions should I ask so I don't have a bad experience again after all this time?  &nbsp;\n\nAlso, does anyone have any haircare tips for me?

Unfortunately, finger detangling only would be really difficult. I use a super wide tooth comb. I then put my hair into two twists or 3 strand braids and use a silk headscarf.\n\nHas anyone in the 3 and 4 types done no poo with good results?

If you're piling on mask after mask and conditioner after conditioner, there's going to be a lot of product build up, clogging up and dulling your hair. Clarifying shampoos are designed to clear up that build up, they are usually clear or a tinted clear color, but there are exceptions. This is **ESPECIALLY** important for low porosity hair that is very prone to feeling weighed down, which bring me to my next point:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Find out your hair type:**\n\n\\- Find your porosity (Does your hair thirsting for a lot of moisture? Or can it only take so much?)\n\n\\- Find your thickness (Are your hair strands thick or thin? Hold a clean strand up to the light.)\n\n\\- Find your density (Is your scalp easily visible with the slightly movement? Or is it hard to glimpse with even the strongest parts?) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese features of your hair, while curl pattern is important, are going to help you paint a fuller picture of what ingredients your hair needs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The products I use/used/look for are:**\n\nClarifying:\n\n* Maui Moisture Detoxifying + Volcanic Ash (S/C)\n* Shea Moisture JBCO (S/C), ABS Bamboo Charcoal (S), African Water Mint & Ginger (S)\n* OGX Refreshing Scalp + Tea Tree Mint, Purifying Charcoal Detox, Eucalyptus Mint (S) \n* Head And Shoulder Royal Oils (S/C)\n\nMoisturizing:\n\n* Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate (S/C), Curl Quench (S/C), Nourish & Moisture (S/C)\n* Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus (S/C), Superfruit Complex (S/C), Baobab & Tea Tree Oils (S/C)\n* Head and Shoulder Royal Oils Moisture Boost (Co-wash)\n\nExtra Toppings/Deep Treatments:\n\n* Head and Shoulders Royal Oils Moisture Boost (Scalp Elixir, Masque, Scalp Cream)\n* Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus (Curl Smoothie), JBCO (Leave In)\n* Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate (Hair Mask), Curl Quench (Curl Smoothie)\n* OGX TeaTree Mint Scalp Treatment\n* OGX Argan Oil of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy stylist uses the Kevin Murphy Hydrate Me Line when I go to him for a good deep refresher. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis isn't an all inclusive list and I don't use ALL of these at once for a routine. I usually alternate weeks between clarifying and moisturizing and add in a H%S wash routine on the second wash of the week to keep dandruff off. Sometimes, I use a clarifying shampoo then shampoo with a moisturizing shampoo, condition with a conditioner of each category, then rinse and set with an oil in braids. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*It's all about **listening** **to your hair** and finding what your hair needs at that moment.\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My hair: Type 3b/c, thick, dense, low porosity.**",

I do the search and destroy method after my two strand twist are dry. I will clip the ends that are frayed or dead. I do not straighten my hair to do it because my hair is easily susceptible to heat damage. I wouldn’t cut it wet either because I heard it can lead to breakage but mainly because natural shrinks so much when it dries. \n\nSide note: does biotin work? I wanted to use it but I know a few who suffered from acne from it. I fear using it because I’m clearing up my face from acne. \n\nHonestly, I would just say keep your hair hydrated, moisturizer and refrain from a lot of heat for the best growth. Trimming your ends regularly will give you more growth in the end! Also, twisting and other protective styles are great too if you don’t want to wear your hair out.\n\nHair type: 4A\n\nAs for questions, just ask for recommendations for hair growth but ultimately you’ll know what works for you!",

I'm starting with 100% macadamia nut oil and so far I love it,  I feel like I already see a difference and it's only been a week!  What I am unsure about is the wiping off part after I've rubbed it all in.  Am I suppose to leave a little bit of oil on?  I carefully but thoroughly dab/rubbed all of the oil off with lukewarm water and my skin felt dry and tight like after using too strong of a cleanser.  I've been just getting most but not all of the oil off.  Then also applying some after my chemical exfoliation has had time to sit as a moisturizer.  That seems to work well but I am worried about make up debris being left on my face.  I don't want to double cleans with a soap, I feel like that defeats the purpose of the oil in the first place but has anyone tried double cleansing with oils?  \nAlso I picked up some AHA exfoliating pads from GoW and have used then a couple of times and noticed this morning that there were little bits of peeling skin.  I wasn't sure if that was just what the exfoliation was suppose to do and it was dead skin sloughing off or if it was drying me out.  My skin has not felt dry at all or itchy or irritated so I am leaning towards dead skin but I thought I'd ask while I'm here.  Thank you so much for your help and I can't wait to try the rest of my oils!  Also I'm sorry for any weird formatting or spelling I am on my phone, or if this was not an appropriate post for any reason.....also that I ramble xD.  ",

Early on, when there was much dirt on the cotton pad, I repeated the process, and there was less dirt on the pad, but still some. So recently I added a witch hazel toner after the OCM to remove the remnants of makeup after the OCM, rather than double-cleansing. (I got the Thayer's alcohol-free Witch Hazel at GNC.)\n\nI am not using oil for my moisturizer. I use Cetaphyl lotion. Most days, I do OCM, toner, then moisturizer. I'm phasing in an AHA, so on days I do the AHA, I do OCM, toner, AHA, then moisturizer. This is my evening routine. Morning routine is OCM, toner, sunscreen, moisturizer.\n\nThe peeling skin could be related to the AHA. Did you patch test and phase in the AHA? How often are you doing the AHA? I hear it's a good idea to introduce only one new product at a time, so if your skin reacts, you know which product caused it. But if you didn't do that, then maybe you can cut out one product at a time and see what resolves the issue.",

    "body": "Hello, men!\n\n**INTRO** (*Feel free skip this if you really don't care*) I, like many others, used to ALWAYS cut my hair short because I just had no idea what else to do with it. It would get somewhat long, and then immediately get super poofy, wavy, and just generally unmanageable.\n\nI literally didn't know I had curly hair until I got to college and just wanted to grow out my hair to see what it would do. At about... 4\" long it magically started to curl instead of just being really wavy.\n\nSO! If you have the massive curly hair, or fluffy wavy hair that might actually be curly, here are some ways you can manage it:\n\n**Here's the actual information**\n1) Well-moisturized hair will actually curl more. Currently I am using Organix brand macadamia nut oil conditioner, and it is... very enjoyable. The conditioner smells like a mix of bubblegum and cologne. It's really weird, but nice!\n\n2) Continuing the above, as most men mention here, you don't need to be shampooing your hair every day. It will dry your hair, and thus turn would-be beautiful curls into an ugly, frizzy bird's nest. I COULD 'poo like once a week if I used no products, but because I do, I wash approximately every 3 days, give or take, but condition every day.\n\n3) Oil is your best friend for curly hair. Curly hair travels away from your scalp, and thus the majority of the strand is off the oil-producing area. I use, again, Organix brand Argan oil. I apply it at night after a shower. This product smells VERY perfumy, but I enjoy it nonetheless. Sometimes I tilt my head back and shake my hair just to smell it haha...\n\nI have used other brands of oils/serums including John Frieda's frizz ease, ranging to using straight vitamin E oil. I like the Organix brand best because it is a pretty thin oil, but I still feel very soft afterwards.\n\n4) Moving on! In the morning, I wet my hair. Drench it in the sink. I then towel dry, and apply Moroccan Oil brand Curling Cream. This is a salon-quality, somewhat expensive product, and it works VERY well, but I imagine any other cream styling product will work similarly. The reason I recommend cream styling products is because they are less likely to be alcohol based, they will moisturize your hair which I mentioned was important, and they are less likely to become crunchy as they dry, and even if they do, it's easy to separate the hair into a bouncy, defined curl.\n\n5) OPTIONAL STEP: I then diffuse dry my hair. If you are unfamiliar with this, it involved an attachment to a blowdryer that is made ONLY for curly hair, but it separates the hair and causes the air from the blowdryer to spread very widely, thus resulting in a less concentrated stream of air that will still dry your hair, but won't blast it in every direction and make it all frizzy.\n\nI choose to blowdry because I don't like walking around with a wet head for 2 hours until my hair dries. I like to leave the house feeling done, you know?\n\nAnyway, if you aren't comfortable enough with your masculinity to use a hairdryer, just let it airdry. A hairdryer will result in a fuller, shinier, and more defined curl, however.\n\n6) If I need to retouch later, I simply apply a small bit of the oil over my hair. I try not to necessarily RUN my fingers through my hair for obvious reasons -- don't want to fluff up my hair and separate the curls. I kind of scrunch it in or just pull it across an entire area of curls.\n\nFor reference, I am white, with, when pulled straight, hair that goes down to my chin (~6.5 inches?), but curled, is about eye-level. The curls are about 3/4\" to 1\" in diameter.\n\nI hope somebody found this useful!\n\n**TL;DR Moisturize the shit out of your hair. Use a styling cream. Don't be a pussy, use a hairdryer. Retouch with oil.**\n",

I'm also a bit concerned about the smell of the castor oil.\n\nFORMULA\n\n21.5% almond oil\n\n17% each of squalane, jojoba, grapeseed, and macadamia nut oil\n\n5% beeswax\n\n5% castor oil\n\n0.5% bisabolol\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny feedback appreciated!",

Almost no scent and a pale yellow colour (I used yellow beeswax). It's pretty nice and I'm happy with it!\n\nThe method I used was essentially to combine all the carrier oils + bisabolol, melt the beeswax, and then combine everything together.\n\nThe main challenge was getting the beeswax to melt and stay melted. I think I was too cautious with my double boiler and didn't turn the heat up high enough. I'll be more confident next time. \n\nOnce the beeswax melted it became clear that there were some solid impurities in it; I wish I'd had the facilities to filter it. Need to get hold of some filter paper.\n\nIt's definitely important to add the oils to the beeswax, not vice versa. I tried adding beeswax to oils and the beeswax immediately solidified without combining.\n\nI'd like a slightly stiffer texture, so will use a higher proportion of beeswax next time round. I'll also get a better scale because my current one is super hard to use.\n\nAlso I really miss my temperature gun. 😭 I'm staying with my parents right now and my temp gun is at home.",

I agree with the person that said you are starting with too many ingredients, especially when you are figuring out consistency. My instinct is that this will come out as a thick liquid as opposed to a balm. Perhaps do some small sample batches with the castor oil, beeswax, and whichever of the other oils is easiest/cheapest (grape seed?) until it feels about right. It can take a week for things with wax in then to fully set up and thicken.",

I have normal skin (not dry, not oily), I rarely ever have a break out of any kind...My main concern is making sure that I'm taking all the right steps as far as anti-aging goes. And also if any of the products I'm using are either ineffective or not good for skin. I have no known allergies. \n\nEvening:\n\n* Remove makeup with Pond's Cold Cream cleansers (the Pond's website just lists \"key ingredients\" as Mineral Oil and Beeswax)\n\n* Wash every evening with Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser.

(Ingredients: Maize flour (Zea mays) , Glycerine , Talc , Water (Aqua) , Corn Oil (Zea mays) , Corn Meal (Zea Mays) , popcorn , Gardenia Extract (Gardenia jasminoides) , Cinnamon Powder (Cinnamomum cassia) , Fragrance)\n\n\n* Moisturize with Ole Henriksen Truth Creme Advanced Hydration (Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau, Glycerin, Squalane, Triheptanoin, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Candelilla/Jojoba/Rice Bran Polyglyceryl-3 Esters, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5, Ceramide 2, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Hydrolyzed Viola Tricolor Extract, Calcium Ascorbate, Rosa Canina Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Saccharum Officinarium (Sugar Cane) Extract, Acer Saccharinum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Soybean Sterols, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Bisabolol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Trehalose, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Vaccinium Myrtillus Extract, Sorbitol, Xanthan Gum, Potato Starch Modified, Sodium Phytate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Parfum/Fragrance)\n\n* Serum/Oil application with Fresh's Elixir Ancien. I actually only have this product because I was lucky enough to snag it for $5 at a QVC sample sale. It retails for well over $200 so I'm kind of hoping that if it is effective the active ingredients are more cheaply obtainable :) (Ingredients: LIMNANTHES ALBA (MEADOWFOAM) SEED OIL, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS (JOJOBA) SEED OIL, TRITICUM VULGARE (WHEAT) GERM OIL, HIPPOPHAE RHAMNOIDES OIL, RIBES NIGRUM (BLACK CURRANT) SEED OIL, COMMIPHORA MYRRHA EXTRACT, ROSMARINUS OFFICINALIS (ROSEMARY) LEAF EXTRACT, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, DIPALMITOYL, HYDROXYPROLINE, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, PROPYL GALLATE, CITRIC ACID )\n\n\nMorning:\n\n* I generally skip washing my face in the morning. I take showers at night and after my whole evening routine I guess I don't feel dirty enough or whatever. Do let me know if this is a big no no.\n\n* I religiously apply Neutrogena Ultra Sheer liquid sunblock in SPF 70. It's the best sunscreen I've ever used for putting on under makeup. It has such a dry finish and doesn't interfere with my makeup application at all which is a huge plus. \n\n\n\nThanks so much for your help!

    "body": "Yo, brothers! It's so important to remember that if you’re trying to set the stage for the fastest, fullest, healthiest growth, the first step is reducing inflammation. For folks with sensitive skin, that can be tougher than it is for others, so I wanted to write this short guide for you. A brother asked about this on the sub yesterday, and most of this info was there, but I thought it deserved its own post in case someone needs it down the road. Let’s dive in.\n\nFirst off, sensitive skin can be a challenge, but it’s super manageable once you know what to look for. The beard care market is full of products that claim to work miracles, but a lot of them are downright awful for sensitive skin. Here’s what you need to know to find products that actually help rather than hurt. Here's a few red flags to watch for!\n\n**Understand the oils**\n\nNot all oils are created equal, especially for sensitive skin. The big thing to look for is the oil's comedogenic rating. This tells you how likely an oil is to clog your pores. For sensitive skin, stick with oils that have a rating of 2 or lower. Anything below 1 is even better and is classified as \"non-comedogenic\". That’s the gold standard. Clogging your pores can lead to irritation, inflammation, and even breakouts, which is the exact opposite of what you want when trying to grow a healthy beard. You can look these up with a quick Google search, but here's some common ones. \n\n**Hemp Seed Oil** – 0,2  \n**Argan Oil** – 0.7  \n**Sweet Almond Oil** – 1.7  \n**Jojoba Oil** – 2.6  \n**Grapeseed Oil** – 0.8  \n**Avocado Oil** – 1.9  \n**Castor Oil** – 1.1  \n**Coconut Oil (Unrefined)** – 4.5  \n**Coconut Oil (Fractionated)** – 0.8  \n**Olive Oil** – 2.6  \n**Apricot Kernel Oil** – 1.7  \n**Hazelnut Oil** – 0.7  \n**Sunflower Oil** – 0.3  \n**Macadamia Nut Oil** – 2.1  \n**Pumpkin Seed Oil** – 2.4  \n**Rice Bran Oil** – 2.1  \n**Rosehip Seed Oil** – 1.5  \n**Baobab Oil** – 1.6  \n**Meadowfoam Seed Oil** – 1.4  \n**Shea Butter (Unrefined)** – 0.4  \n**Shea Butter Oil** – 1.4  \n**Lanolin Oil** – 4.2  \n**Palm Kernel Oil** – 4.1  \n**Wheat Germ Oil** – 5  \n**Emu Oil** – 3.3  \n**Ostrich Oil** – 3.6  \n**Duck Oil** – 4.2\n\nYou can take a quick average of a blend to get a loose idea, but that's the best you can do without knowing the exact ratios a company uses of each oil. Always ask. Any company worth a damn will know the comedogenic rating of their formula off-hand. \n\n**Avoid artificial fragrances**\n\nArtificial fragrances are one of the worst offenders for sensitive skin. These are often alcohol-based or packed with synthetic chemicals that can trigger reactions. Common culprits like linalool and limonene are found in tons of mass-market products. You want to see \"No Artificial Fragrances\" on the label. Essential oils are usually a better choice, but even those need to be used carefully. Regulation in the essential oil world is basically nonexistent, and there’s a ton of misinformation out there. For example, most don't know that there are only 176 recognized essential oils, and of those, only about 102 are commonly used in scenting. So if someone’s telling you they’ve got \"leather\", \"tobacco\", or \"mahogany\" essential oil, that’s nonsense. Those aren’t essential oils. They might be fragrance oils derived from natural absolutes (which is a whole thing). but they are more likely artificial and made with synthetic chemicals. Either way, avoid them unless you know exactly how they’re made. Even with real essential oils, concentration matters. Sensitive skin can’t handle high doses. The safe level for essential oils in a beard product is about 1.75% or less. Anything more can lead to major reactions or even photosensitivity.\n\n**Choose the right cleanser**\n\nSensitive skin thrives in a balanced ecosystem. That means finding a pH-balanced beard wash and using it as necessary. Always follow up with a good, non-comedogenic oil to calm the skin and keep inflammation under control. Harsh soaps or products with sulfates will strip your beard and the skin beneath it of natural oils, leaving everything dry and irritated. That’s a fast track to more inflammation and slower growth, especially for dudes with sensitive skin. Stick to gentle cleansers designed specifically for beards.\n\nSensitive skin might take a little more effort, but always worth it to grow a great beard. Employ these tools and let that beard rip, y'all. ",

Whether you use straight stearic, kokum or lard a good shaving soap has 50 percent plus of stearic acid content. There are some soaps that try to get around the high stearic by using bentonite clay but they are generally not very good.\n\nThat being said, try 60% stearic acid, 30% coconut and 10% Shea. You are also going to want to use Potassium hydroxide either along with the sodium hydroxide. Use soapcalc.net for your specific recipe, I usually print out two versions one with KOH and one with NaOH and then multiply the lye requirement by a percentage that adds to 100. So KOHx.7 and NaOHx.3 and use that much of each.",

For most of my life, I’ve just…not used lotion. My skin has suffered! I’m always on the hunt for something that works. \n\nCriteria: I was looking for a medium/light lotion for my chest/arms/shoulders that would moisturize without casing acne or irritation. I already use cerave/Vanicream for my heavy duty lotion but I wanted something lighter. I also wanted something that sinks in and is non-medicated.\n\nThe Lotion Company - paraben, petroleum, and cruelty free. Small batch skincare made by a father/daughter team in Indiana, USA. 10+ scents. Available in some small stores nationwide, shipping from their website to USA and Canada, and available on Amazon. (I grabbed all this info from their website for posterity)\n\nCaramel candy is the scent I have. It’s a nice sweet scent that doesn’t linger too long after application. When applied, it turns white (from the glycerin) and requires a little more time to rub it in fully than other lotions. I didn’t find this a problem as it does sink in and leaves no residue.\n\nIt doesn’t give me acne or bumps!!! I repeat, NO ACNE. I have been using it for a few weeks now and no breakouts. I’m so happy, it’s exactly what I needed. I searched this sub and nobody has commented about the lotions before, so I had to share my experience. \n\nHere are the ingredients for the caramel candy lotion, for those who need it:\n\nIngredients: Water, Aloe Vera, Glycerin, Hawaiian Macadamia Nut Oil, Sesame Seed Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol (and) Ceteareth-20, Vitamin A Palmitate, Vitamin E Acetate, DL Panthenol, Allantoin, Carbomer, T.E.A., EDTA, Propanediol, Sorbitan Caprylate, and Benzoic Acid, Ti 02, Betaine, Fragrance",

I've been living in Korea for 2 years and since then I've tried many new (especially Korean) facial products. In the beginning of 2014, my routine was:\nCleanse: Cetaphil | Toner: Etude House Malgem Smoother | Essence: Innisfree Soybean Energy Essence | Lotion: Cetaphil Lotion | Bb cream: The Face Shop Power Perfection BB Cream. Sometimes the occasional sheet mask or mud mask (usually Innisfree).\n\nThis worked until a certain extent, when I started breaking out some and when I switched products in summer, I started breaking out a lot (using mostly highly fragranced Laneige/Iope products). It worsened dramatically when I started eating a lot of ice cream (anyone knows Korean Bingsoo? I ate that every day in summer...), yoghurt and milk. I have a history of being allergic to milk when I was younger, so cutting that out was the first thing I did. After that, I stopped the usage of any fancy face products, except for an oil cleanser (Body Shop), face cleanser (La Roche Posy Toleriane Dermo Cleanser) and moisturizer (Cetaphil Lotion during the day and Cetaphil Cream during the night), and the occasional usage of BB cream (Hanskin Super Magic BB Cream). \nI should also add that my face is *normal-dry*: mostly normal in summer and dry in winter.\n\nSince then, I have tried introducing many products.

As far as I can tell, there are no chemicals used and the process is done at a low temp (oil is not made rancid).  Vitamin E and antioxidants are preserved, but the oil is usable at up to 500 degrees.\n\nI have trouble frying steaks with butter because the butter burns/browns if it gets on the pan.  Olive oil, obviously, isn't usable either.  Macadamia nut oil works well. But I fried a steak in avocado oil, and it was the best steak I've ever had.\n\nWhat's /r/paleo's thoughts on this stuff?  Good because the refinement process doesn't damage the oil or add chemicals, or bad for a reason I can't think of?",

For me, there are only a few temperatures for a pan..  Cool enough to touch, hot enough for water to sizzle and evaporate, and hot enough for the water to bead and roll around the pan.  I don't put the steak in until it reaches the bead stage, and sometime it smokes and sometimes it doesn't.  Soon enough i'll have an IR thermometer and i'll have more control and greater ability to avoid smoking.  Anyway, I have yet to use avocado oil for searing a steak, maybe it doesn't smoke at all until 500F.  Logic tells me that any oil that contains pufa, avocado included, is going to smoke to some degree, at lower temperatures.  But regardless, I only use enough oil to coat the steak(dump a little oil, generally olive or bacon fat, on a plate and coat both sides of the steak in it) when searing it, then I dump it out once i'm done searing, turn the temperature down and finish with butter and the rest.  I have used avocado oil for salad dressing though, and it was delicious from what I remember.  Very avocado-y, implying the extraction process wasn't too harsh.",

    "body": "Hello all. I'm new to this user group. I stumbled upon it just today when I was doing some online research about eczema. I have had eczema for about 15 years now. I found a solution which I'll mention toward the end of this post. At first eczema was a minor problem -- I had some lesions on my arms and legs. I didn't pay it much mind, since I usually only had a few lesions at a time. It was only visible to other people during the summertime when I wore short-sleeved shirts and shorts. But gradually my eczema got worse. Then I noticed that if I took an over-the-counter allergy medicine such as Claritin or Benadryl, I wouldn't get as many eczema lesions. So by using the over-the-counter allergy medicine, I thought I had it under control. But last spring I noticed the itching was getting worse. Through searching the Amazon website, I found and tried many expensive creams, such as Wild Naturals Manuka Honey Cream, Adamia Therapeutic Repair Lotion with Macadamia Nut Oil, and Puriya Daily Moisturizing Cream, which bills itself as \"The Mother of All Creams.\" Also, I had tried Cerave Moisturizing Cream, and Eucerin Eczema Cream. I was also spraying  [**SkinSmart** Eczema Therapy, Hypochlorous Antimicrobia](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N0O0TV7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)l Spray on my skin once or twice daily. All of these creams helped to moisturize my skin and the SkinSmart spray helped to kill the bacteria on my skin. However, I would have needed to spray the SkinSmart much more frequently to stop the eczema, but the spray is expensive, and I would have had to go through a bottle every day in order to keep the eczema from appearing. I also tried a liquid called Thyme Out, which kills bacteria on skin. The Thyme Out helped to get rid of the eczema, but I had to stop using it because it caused me to sleep for 12 or more hours a day. \n\n Over time I had to take increasing doses of Benadryl to keep the lesions at bay. It got to the point last May where I was taking 300 milligrams of  Benadryl per day and that still wasn't enough to stop the itching. I couldn't sit and read a book for more than a minute without stopping to scratch, and the lesions had multiplied so that people who saw my bare arms thought I had a bad case of poison ivy.  I realized I needed professional help -- and many people were telling me that. The rate at which the lesions appeared was rapidly increasing. I got an online appointment with a doctor who wasn't a dermatologist. I sent her photos of my skin and she prescribed an oral steroid (prednisone) and arranged for me to see a dermatologist. In the meantime, I had continued to search Amazon for remedies, since I have found in the past that doctors don't always have the best treatments. Based upon Amazon user reviews, I ordered ShiKai Borage Therapy Advanced Formula Lotion Dry Skin Lotion. I promise that I don't work for this company, and I have no financial stake in it, and this company didn't send me any free products. This lotion, which I continue to use twice a day, has been a real game changer for me. As soon as I started using it, the itching started to subside. I noticed that if I only put the ShiKai cream on my arms and legs, lesions started to appear on other parts of my body. This told me that the borage oil cream somehow defused bacteria. So now I spread the cream over my entire body. The dermatologist prescribed a steroid cream for me, but I only used it for a short time. I didn't want to use steroids for the long term. So I started taking 25 milligrams of diphenhydramine hydrocloride (Benadryl) every day. That's an ordinary dose, and I have found that it's enough to prevent the eczema now that I have the borage oil cream. The borage oil is very moisturizing and also I think it counteracts the bacteria that causes the eczema. I highly recommend this cream to anyone with an eczema problem. I find that my eczema has pretty much disappeared after a couple of months of using this cream. It might help others!",

I guess it would be the same sort of feeling that you might get from wearing powdered latex gloves.

Is there a specific type of ingredient that I should be using that will help the lotion penetrate my skin and reduce that weird powdery film feeling?\n\nIf you need a recipe example this is the latest one I’ve tried.

I apologize if these questions have really obvious answers, but I'm getting some conflicting information from Google and now I’m even more confused than when I started.\n\nI used these ingredients, not necessarily in this order: coconut oil, macadamia nut oil, avocado oil, sweet almond oil, apricot kernel oil, castor oil, sodium hydroxide, mango seed butter, shea butter, cocoa butter, fragrance, pigments.\n\nSuperfat was 5% and the water/lye ratio was 2.7:1.\n\nSupplies: I used pyrex bowls, an immersion blender, an 8 cavity silicone mold, and silicone stirring tools.\n\nI let it sit for 48 hours in the molds before removing them. I put them on a paper plate with a paper towel over them and let them sit in my laundry room for about 4 1/2 weeks. My batch produced a creamy lather and was good in terms of hardness… but it doesn’t look good. It has holes (like swiss cheese), it turned brown, and it leaves my skin feeling kind of tight.\n\nQUESTIONS:\n\n*Is the discoloration due to the ingredients, fragrance, or the actual process? If it’s an ingredients issue, which ones can cause this?\n\n*What could have caused the holes? They were only on the bottom when I took them out of the molds.\n\n*I’m not sure how much pigment I should be using per pound of soap. In the same first batch I used about 1/4 tsp pigment mixed with a tsp of glycerin to create a swirl and then added the mixture to about a 1/3 of the batter. The color keeps rubbing off in chunks on my skin. How much pigment should I be using to color an entire pound of soap versus a small amount to create a swirl? I’ve been using TKB’s soapberry pigments.\n\n*I don’t have a loaf mold. I’m using an 8 bar silicone mold. I started pouring my soap into the molds once I could see trails on the top of the batter. By the time I reached the end, the soap had started to get too thick and it made the top too lumpy/stringy. Can I reheat this on the stove to thin it out again? Or is this a no no?\n\n*Which oils would be best for someone who needs something super moisturizing? I’m trying to make Christmas gifts and my SIL has pretty bad eczema. Is there a reliable chart somewhere that details what each oil brings to the table in a soap?\n\n*How many oils should or shouldn’t I be using in a batch of soap? I used about six different oils in this batch (coconut, macadamia, avocado, sweet almond, apricot kernel, and castor). I don’t know why I used so many. It seemed like a good idea at the time.\n\n*If there’s soda ash on my soap, does that mean I’m doing something wrong or is this just part of the process?\n\n\nSorry for the length and all the questions, but I appreciate any answers or advice you guys might have!

        "body": "* The discolouration could be from vanilla in the scent.\n\n\n* Did you tap the mold on your bench after you poured the batter in? This is to get the soap to settle into all the nooks and crannies of the mold and prevent air bubbles like what you've found.\n\n\n* I usually just \"eyeball\" the colourants, so I'm not sure on the ideal amount. Also, you can get these little battery powered coffee frothers (IKEA sell them for $2-3) and they are ideal for mixing up the powdered colourants into the carrier oil (I usually mix them with sweet Almond, but any liquid oil will work). Clay I disperse in to distilled water. Whizzing up the colourants with the little frothers gets rid of any lumps of colour, which could be what's causing your problem.\n\n\n* Don't know about reheating it, sorry. We just have to work quickly, as once the lye hits the oil we're on a time limit.\n\n\n* If you Google \"what do different oils do in soap\" you'll find a few websites have good information on it. Basically, coconut oil lathers up like a demon, but is drying, so you might want to limit this to 20%. Olive oil is gentle, but doesn't lather up much, etc.\n\n\n* I personally don't use that many oils in soap. The macadamia, avocado, sweet almond, apricot kernel oils are considered \"luxury\" oils, that I think most people tend to limit to around 10% of their total oils, because they can get quite expensive. Usually, when I work out a recipe, I'll have three things that don't change, they are 20% coconut oil, 5% castor oil and 5-10% of a butter. This makes up 30-35% of the recipe. The rest of it, I'll usually use olive oil, sustainable palm oil and rice bran oil. I like to use a food grade olive oil from the supermarket, I buy it in 4L tins. It's the lightest coloured and mildest tasting one I can find. It's great for soapmaking and good on a salad too.\n\n\n* Soda ash can be prevented on the top of your soap by giving it a light spray with 99% isopropyl alcohol (I got mine at a hardware store). If it's still occuring, or is down the sides of the soap too, you could be mixing your oils and lye together when they are too cool.\n\n\nHope this helps!",

I can't tell if that means its gone bad or if its a normal reaction to oils combining. The smell hasn't changed and it's different from the way coconut oil looks when its starting to harden, its kept between 60°- 75°f in my bathrrom so I don't think its temperature related. \n\nDo any of those oils need to be kept in the refrigerator to stay fresh? I'm wondering if its bacteria or rancid or something.\n\nI'm using a clear glass jar that has a dropper style top for the mixture if that makes any difference.\n\nIn the meantime I have been mixing small batches in hand every time I clean my face to avoid possible bacteria.\n\nThanks for any insight to natural oils and safe storage advice in advance!

        "body": "I've never had this issue and have been oil cleansing for probably 6-8 months now, but my PHD in google says it's probably temperature related.  Oil gets cloudy if it gets cold and will go back to normal if you warm it up, and should not be an indicator of it spoiling.  However if you are worried about contamination, try a pump style bottle that is water tight, so no chance of anything getting in.  This way you aren't opening and closing your oil every time you need to wash.  I'd also suggest adding a few drops of vitamin E oil.  Oil will go rancid if it goes from hot to cold to hot to cold, vitamin E prevents this and prolongs the shelf life especially if you are storing it in a bathroom.  Most bathrooms with a hot shower, the temperature will fluctuate more than 15 degrees so it's not going to be consistent for storage unless you add vitamin E.  Even walmart carries a bottle of liquid vitamin e oil where the vitamins are found, but you can order a better quality & more potent one online from a lot of places.  Last bit of advice - an amber or dark colored bottle protects oil and gives it a longer shelf life; especially if you choose to add some essential oils to your cleansing oil at some point.",

If you want to help it last longer you can add vitamin E to it when you first make it.   \n\n\nKeep it sealed tightly, out of direct sunlight. The more oxygen and light it is exposed to, the quicker it will break down. Oil also can't really grow bacteria, which is why you don't need to preserve it.   \n\n\nCastor and Jojoba don't really solidify so I don't think it's sediment, it could be. Heating it to 70C should kill anything in it if you're worried about contamination. \n\nI think Macadamia nut oil has a lot of double bonds so it will go rancid quicker.   \n\n\nWhen you get your oil check it's shelf life. Most companies will have a date on the oils depending on when they made the oil. Depends on where you're getting your oil too.   \n\n\nOils are constantly becoming rancid, the bonds are constantly breaking. So there's not really like a point where it's no longer good and becomes bad. It's constantly going \"bad\". Unless it smells super weird I wouldn't worry too much about it.   \n\n\nThe oils you listed are pretty hearty except for the macadamia if my memory serves.",

Sorry I don't know what type of food an avocado is haha. Coconut milk is good. Sometimes I have toasted coconut flakes in coconut milk as \"cereal.\" Also you can get fattier meats, like chicken thighs instead of breast- eat the skin too, ribeyes, bacon etc and that might help you reach your calorie goal.",

I am 19Male with medium length hair(can tie a manbun but they r not past shoulders),wavy/curly thick hair,think about kit harington,how his hair look irl,how curly/wavy,how he styles it etc. Also they tend to frizz,not very bad and its not very noticable but they are not 100% frizz free.\n\nSo I am using a shampoo with sulfates(once a week) and a leave in with alcohol denat and my question is will going back to silicones make my hair built up inbetween washes?  \n\nI know that I shouldnt wash my hair that often especially with a sulfate shampoo but I am using a lot of products,yes they are CG friendly(although some have parabens and 1 has alcohol denat as I told u) but I am worry of build up and also I am a college student so budget is limited(in Greece everything without sulfates has 30€+). \n\nI am using 2 different gels both CG friendly,2 different pastes both CG but 1 has parabens and a leave-in conditioner with paraben and alcohol denat. Could those products cause build up or I can wash my hair with sulfates for more than every 7 days?  I could write you exactly the names of the products but I think its better to just told you what they r about instead of filling lines with products names. \nAlso I am not using them all at once :), I just use some days this,some days that etc...\n\n\nShampoo --> A random no silicone shampoo with only one sulfate(sodium laureth sulfate).

I'm sensitive to silicone (breaks me out almost immediately, dimethicone and Cyclopentasiloxane), Cetearyl/Stearyl alcohol, and citrus (and other) essential oils among other things.

I patch tested a moisturizer with Cetearyl alcohol, and it only made me break out, didn't make my face burn like a thousand evil souls. \n\nRight now, my skin is mostly okay, its still a little dry, but it's shiny. I always have that lovely glow, but I don't think it's a moisturized glow, I think it's an over-exfoliated glow. Powder can't cover it, and if it does, it feels like my face is cracking. The only exfoliation I've done since early in the year is with the konjac sponge, and I quit using that a month ago. My makeup doesn't stick really well to my cheeks, and my face is easily red.

The sunscreen isn't the best option, but I haven't found one to not break me out or make my skin burn besides this and a mineral fusion bb cream. But, wearing this tinted moisturizer has helped my melasma clear, and keeps my acne scars from staying for more than a week or so. \n\nBasically, I'll gladly take any suggestions because I want my skin to be healthy again.

One that’s more natural and good on sensitive skin, but maybe can help me bronze a bit more versus yellowing…? \n\nProducts:\n-I usually use all sensitive skin and more natural products, fragrance free.\n\n-I’ve been using Maui Babe bronzing lotion tanning bed formula and my skin seems to be fine with it. \n*Does anyone know if this is safe for sun tanning as well?\n\n*I was thinking of using their after bronzing lotion but I’m nervous about the ingredients:\nPurified Hawaiian Water, Aloe Vera\n(Cel.

You don't have to use a tan extender per say, you could use a moisturizer you already have that your skin likes. As long as your skin stays hydrated that's what it needs to keep a good tan. I don't always use moisturizer that is made by tanning companies. Right now because I've been battling the dry air in Arizona I've been using Pacifica watermelon seed body butter as well as pure cocoa butter and Shea butter. As long as I'm hydrated, that's what will help. Also drinking more water",

It essentially aids in the evaporation of product, aiding in absorption/the feeling of absorption [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siloxane#Cyclomethicones). \n* The result is a product that leaves skin feeling matte, as opposed to sticky or tacky [[2]](http://www.thedermreview.com/cyclomethicone/).\n* Cyclomethicone molecules are too large to penetrate the skin, so they sit atop it while allowing the active ingredients to absorb. [[2]](http://www.thedermreview.com/cyclomethicone/).\n* Seems to be considered a \"good silicone\" due to the fact it evaporates (at least in reference to hair care, as it doesn't build up) [[3]](http://www.xovain.com/hair/silicones-in-hair-and-skin-products-to-avoid)\n\n*edit 2* lol I get it nobody likes Michelle Phan. I'm not a fan either nor do I consider her any kind of expert, just was the first source when I googled dry oil and found any info on an ingredient. Thanks for the meaningless downvotes on actual info tho :/",

My hairdresser claimed that oils just dry out curly hair. I use this oil on dry hair.\n\nShe claimed it could be contributing to my breakage. However, I’ve been using the oil for 10 years or so and the breakage is new just in the last couple of years.\n\nI think I’m probably over-washing my hair and using too much Olaplex.\n\nAnyhow, I think that from experience oils are definitely not drying for hair! When I lived in Germany I would get a treatment with castor oil heated up and then avacado, and it made my hair the healthiest it has ever been — I was able to grow it long.\n\nAny other opinions? Her justification was that oil and water don’t mix, but I put it on dry hair.",

My skin sensitivity is reduced and my acne is so much better (I still have some but they feel like normal acne now - not patches of white and red blisters on my forehead and chin… \n\nIs it possible that I have been having allergic reactions to the nut oils in my face creams/washes??

I live in a climate that’s hot and humid in the summer and very cold and dry in the winter.\n\nI have been used Cerave in the tub for a bit to put on my legs after shaving. I also used it a few times as an occlusive on my face because I was looking to add more moisture to my nighttime routine. \n\nNighttime routine: Oil cleanse first as needed with Clinique Take the day off balm. Cerave Foaming facial cleanser, Differin spot treatment as needed, Cerave PM facial moisturizing lotion. \n\nSo for the last step of my routine I tried adding Cerave in the tub yesterday since my since is fine with the other Cerave products, and it turns out it’s not fine anymore! My face has been itchy all day and it seems to be having a bad reaction. What else can I use as an occlusive that is not Vaseline? I know it’s very popular here, but I hate the super slimy feeling very much. \n\nAlso, I need a new body lotion to put on after shaving because Cerave in the tub has been making my legs itchy as well. \n\n **I cannot use any products with almond oil, macadamia nut oil, or any other tree nuts oils because I’m allergic to tree nuts.**\n\nI’m very sad to have to discard my Cerave in the tub. I may try it again in the winter to see if my skin reacts differently. \n\nAlso, budget friendly products would be appreciated. Currently like many others unemployed thanks to COVID.\n\nThank you!",

If you haven't used AHAs before, I would suggest to start with lower percentages (12% is a lot) and try using 1-2 times a week to see how your skin responds. If you don't use any other actives (BHA, retinol, vitamin c), would probably suggest using as part of your evening routine.",

I was always an inconsistent face washer, but used lots of moisturizer, and only had minor problems so didn’t bother with more. Then my skin started to get worse, I changed birth control and now have consistent problems. I have small, skin colored bumps on my forehead and along my jaw line, with some occasional white heads and pimples along the jaw and cheek. For the last few weeks it will get better and then worse.\n\nI decided Friday to stop using all products for a few days then reintroduce them slowly but i’m not sure the best way to do that. I’ve been “washing” with water morning and evening, and surprised that I actually quite like it. I haven’t gotten dry or oily, which I expected. However, I’m currently traveling and putting sunscreen on multiple times a day, so need to be able to wash that off properly.\n\nCurrent products I own: neutrogena naturals purifying pore scrub, Simple moisturizing facial wash, S.W. Basics exfoliant, S.W. Basics oil serum, coconut oil. I also have access to macadamia nut oil.\n\nI’m currently in Argentina so have access to more products, though they’ll be expensive. The only face wash I’ve used that fully cleared my face was Lush angels on bare skin.\n\nA lot of info just to ask about the best way to reintroduce products to my skin. Start with a face wash? Moisturizer? All at once?\n\nThanks for your help!",

    "body": "So about maybe a month ago my moisturiser ran out (Olay Total Effects Gentle) and I decided to switch to something else. Well, cue breakouts which I obviously stopped using. The breakouts subsided, but now they're back again for no reason!\n__________________________________________\n\n**Olay Total Effects Gentle**: I had no breakouts from this but I feel it's worth putting this in so we know I don't breakout from anything in it. Been using this since about... September 2013. Finished it around the end of November. \n\n>Water, Glycerin, Isohexadecane, Niacinamide (vitamin B3), Dimethicone, Isopropyl Isostearate, Polyacrylamide, Sorbitan Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Sucrose Polycottonseedate, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Panthenol (pro-vitamin B5), Tocopheryl acetate (vitamin E), Stearyl Alcohol, Titanium Dioxide, Dimethiconol, Benzyl Alcohol, Ethylparaben, Laureth-7, Sucrose Cocoate, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, PEG-100 Stearate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Methylparaben, Ammonium Polyacrylate.\n\n**SunSense Aftersun Creme Gel**: This is what I switched to after the Olay ran out. Used it for less than a week, but I got breakouts in places I normally don't get breakouts from. I was on plain Vaseline until I bought this about mid December.\n\n>Aqua (water), glycerin, paraffinum liquidum, petrolatum, niacinamide, tocopherol (vit E), vitis vinifera (grape seed polyphenols), sodium ascorbyl phosphate (vit. C), panthenol, dimethicone, ceteth-20, acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylte crosspolymer, disodium EDTA, triethanolamine, methylparaben, propylparaben, parfum.\n\n**Plunkett's 99% Aloe Gel**: This is what I switched to *after* the SunSense stuff. The breakouts from the SunSense subsided for a bit, but I was still bumpy in certain places. They've mostly gone down but I do see a couple of new pimples coming up.\n\n>Aloe Barbadensis leaf juice, Allantoin, Carbomer, Disodium edetate, Sodium Hydroxy methylglycinate, Grapefruit seed extract.\n\n_________________________________\n**Neutrogena Extra Gentle Cleanser**: This is my current cleanser. I'm on my second bottle, just started. My skin was pretty much clear when I was using this with the Olay Moisturiser. Been using this since mid-November.\n\n> Water Purified, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Cetyl Ricinoleate(Chamomile (chamomilla recutita) extract), Isohexadecane, TEA Cocoyl Glutamate, Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, PEG 40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PEG 20 Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Bisabolol(anti-irritant and anti-inflammatory), Chamomile Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate(vitamin E), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate(licorice root extract), Stearyl Glycyrrhetinate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10 30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, BHT, Geranium, Dipropylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Propylparaben, Methylparaben\n\n**Neutrogena Oil-Free Sensitive Moisturiser**: This is mostly for reference. I had a spell of clear skin when I was using this but I switched it out in favour of the Olay (I think? I've used this for the longest time, repurchased about 3 times)\n\n> Water , Glycerin , Ethylhexyl Palmitate , Dimethicone , Petrolatum , Cyclomethicone , Soybean Glycine Soya Stearols , Isopropyl Isostearate , Cetyl Alcohol , PEG-10 Soy Sterol , Glyceryl Stearate , PEG-100 Stearate , C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate , Carbomer , Tetrasodium EDTA , Sodium Hydroxide , Diazolidinyl Urea , Ethylparaben , Methylparaben , Propylparaben\n\n**Cetaphil DailyAdvance Hydrating Lotion**: I used this in the winter after the Neutrogena Oil-Free wasn't cutting it. However it was too heavy for me and I noticed I was breaking out from it. I switched back to the Neutrogena until I switched to Olay.\n\n>Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide.\n_______________________________________________\n\nI initially only compared the SunSense to the Cetaphil lotion and found that both had Vitamin E. So I wrote off Vitamin E as the cause of my breakout. However, after continuing to breakout I decided to go back one more moisturiser and look at the Olay. The Olay has Vitamin E in it as well and I don't break out, so now I'm at pretty much a loss of what's making me breakout. \n\nEDIT: Holy shit wall of text. Really sorry! If any of you made it this far, seriously you deserve a trophy or something. Hopefully the formatting makes it easier to read.",
