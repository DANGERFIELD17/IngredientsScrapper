    "body": "Hello everyone! It's your local chicken sandwich/omakase guy here with a fresh new list where I embark on an absolutely disgustingly large sample size of food to answer the impossible question of where the best of a specific food is in our great city. Today, we're going to be talking about french fries, which are maybe the most common food item across menus across the city. About seven months ago, I made [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagofood/comments/18tz7su/what_are_the_best_french_fries_in_chicago/) where I asked the community for their favorite spots in Chicago for french fries, and you guys delivered with quite the docket of places to go for a fry. Well, I'm happy to report that I tried every single place that you guys suggested, plus many many more since then that have been recommended to me, and I have prepared what I believe to be, in my own personal opinion, the top 10 spots to go for a great french fry within the city limits of Chicago. I initially planned top stop at 200 but the final count by the time I ended up writing this was 205 unique restaurants that served fries. \n\nI want to lay out a few qualifiers again for this list before I begin:\n\n-Only french fries made with potatoes were considered. No sweet potato fries, yucca fries, etc. I also did not consider any type of loaded fry or cheese fry. Sauces and seasonings are fine but anything beyond that I consider to be a separate category of food. Shout out to Del Seoul's kimchi fries that I love but couldn't qualify it for this list. \n\n-I only care about the french fries. The fry itself, the sauce it is served with, and the actual serving you get. Every other aspect of the restaurant or the menu is completely irrelevant to me in the context of this list. The ranking is how much I actually enjoyed the experience of eating each fry. \n\n-I live on the North side in Lincoln Park and the selection of fries I've tried are definitely biased toward that. I don't have a car so it's not easy for me to get around to places in the South or West side.\n\n-Takeout/delivery doesn't count as it usually makes the fries soggy. I want to reiterate: any fried food will get soggy when traveling in a sealed container. It steams. It is not fair to judge fried food this way. If you see a fry listed here and you tried after it sat in a container or bag, you're doing yourself a disservice. \n\n-It is a 100% guarantee that there are people reading this that will dislike all 10 of the fries I am about to list, even my top spot, sorry. Food is too subjective and variable, there will never be a place that everyone likes. I am not a monolith, this is just my opinion, feel free to disregard it completely.\n\nHonorable Mentions: Bianca's Burgers, Trivoli Tavern, RL Restaurant, Bitter Pops, NADC Burger, Red Hot Ranch, The Loyalist\n\n**10. Dave's Red Hots (North Lawndale)**\n\nThe first of two hot dog spots that will be featured in this post. As old school as it gets, a nearly 100 year old institution. Hand cut classic, long, crispy, salty deliciousness. Not served with a particular sauce but perfectly enjoyable by itself. This is the only spot I put on my list that also made it onto Nick Kindelsperger and Louisa Chu's Tribune list of top 20 fries under $5 from 2019 after trying 106 spots. To be fair, most of the other spots on my list will cost you over $5, I guess even the humble potato couldn't escape inflation. \n\n\n**9. Wangs (Boystown)** \n\n\nHere's a place I would have never found on my own, never seen it suggested on the sub except for one user in my last post, /u/no_kaleidoscope4752 who told me they were their favorite. Wangs is an Asian gay cocktail bar in the heart of Boystown and they don't even really have a storefront but they are connected to Wakamono. The wasabi fries blew me away. The sauce was doing some heavy lifting, maybe a top 3 fry sauce for me in the city, but the fries themselves are perfectly cooked crispy shoestring fries with togarashi. This was such a pleasant surprise and I'm so glad I found this place. I also tried a crinkle cut truffle fry on special when I went but I thought the truffle was a little overwhelming, although the crinkle cut fries were still cooked exceptionally well. \n\n**8. Frontier (West Town)**\n\nWith this addition, Brian Jupiter's Frontier takes the crown of being the only restaurant to make it onto both my chicken sandwich list and my french fry list. Very crispy, double fried and seasoned with rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper and served with some kind of spicy aioli sauce. One thing about these that is very unusual is that fries are not offered on the menu as a side but are only served with sandwiches at Frontier. I suspect you could order fries on the side if you asked though. These are the only fries I've had that use rosemary and thyme to season them and I personally found it to be incredibly enjoyable. \n\n**7. The Wiener Circle (Lincoln Park)**\n\nThe second fry to hail from a hot dog stand and I suspect this one may be controversial. Usually for this category of fry I see a tremendous preference for Red Hot Ranch. I do love Red Hot Ranch but I also think The Wiener's Circle, when served fresh and eaten at the establishment, are some of the most satisfying fries I've ever had. Does alcohol play a role in that sometimes? I mean yeah, but the same can be said of Red Hot Ranch. Believe it or not, The Wiener's Circle puts a lot of care in blanching their Yukon potatoes and hand cutting these glorious double fried (and very generously portioned) basket of fries for under $5. I suspect many of you have not had these fries fresh at the restaurant while sober. Give it a try, they are addicting. If you've never been, you can also order a chocolate shake here to dip the fries in. As an aside, I also would not mind The Wiener Circle being considered for a Michelin star for their outstanding service. \n\n**6. Frietkoten (West Loop)**\n\nThis Belgian fry stand is located inside of the French Market. Is it in West Loop or is it The Loop? Is it really West Gate Loop? What even is that? Anyway, these Belgian fries are actually made by a Dutch man named Jeroen Hasenbos who created this fry shack in the middle of French Market to replicate a traditional experience from Amsterdam. Is it Belgian or is it Dutch? Someone more worldly than me can maybe weigh in on this. As for what I actually care about, these long crispy fries are hand cut and served with over 20 sauces. Perfectly crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. I think the garlic mayo is the move for the sauce here but \n after all, you are the Ryan Gosling of your french fry saucing. \n\n**5. Hopleaf (Andersonville)**\n\nWow back to back Belgian fries? Yeah, maybe I should visit Belgium sometime. Hopleaf was the most upvoted suggestion in my fry post so it's not a huge shock that they made my list. These are similar in style to Frietkoten but slightly more satisfying to me and the garlic aioli at Hopleaf gives it the edge for me. Just as crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside with slightly better sauce. I love sauce, man. Sit on the patio with one of the many Belgian beers here and a cone of the fries and you'll be feeling happy to be alive. \n\n**4. Rootstock (Humboldt Park)**\n\nThese fries are absolutely killer. Hand cut and actually fried in rice bran oil, not sure if anyone else does that. They come out with an absolutely classic OG McDonald's tasting fry. They serve it with two sauces, a garlic aioli and a house made ketchup. I'm not gonna lie, the ketchup is kind of weird, I am not sure what they put in it, maybe cinnamon? It only vaguely reminds me of ketchup. The garlic aioli is fucking fire though. I don't even dislike the ketchup it just tastes like something else to me. The fries themselves dipped in the aioli is just the platonic ideal of what people yearn for from the glory days of Mickey D's. \n\n**3. Bistro Monadnock (The Loop)**\n\nAn outstanding beef fat fry, every fry incredibly crispy and salty. I think, like Rootstock, these fries may remind you of an ideal old school McDonald's fry. They are served with ketchup and a garlic aioli that is probably just a tad too garlicky. If the garlic aioli was as good as say, the spot I've ranked #1, Monadnock might even be ranked 1 or 2. A quintessential perfect fry crafted to perfection. I cannot recommend this place enough. For $7 though, I think it's a way better value than the double digit dollar spots I ranked ahead of it. \n\n**2. John's Food and Wine (Lincoln Park)**\n\nJohn's produces an insanely delicious and unique fry experience, although it is the single most expensive fry I tried in Chicago, I'm not sure if a more expensive fry exists. The fries go through a multi step blanching and freezing process with Kennebec potatoes, ultimately fried in beef fat. I'm not sure if anywhere else uses Kennebec potatoes (besides the number 1 spot) but what I can say about them is, they fuck. The Wikipedia page for Kennebec under the first bullet point in the entry lists them as large and erect which I think says all that needs to be said. These fries are also served with a leek aioli, also unique and incredibly delicious. While they are the most expensive, the serving is also huge, to the point that I would recommend not ordering them if you're dining by yourself unless you are getting what they describe as a \"happy meal\" which is just an order of fries and a martini at the bar. \n\n**1. Dear Margaret (Lakeview)**\n\nThe kings of the french fry castle, Dear Margaret in Lakeview. Another glorious Kennebec fry. Also fried in beef tallow and dusted with herbs. Served with a roasted garlic aioli that I can only describe as dangerous. These are definitely on the crispier side with a much more golden brown color. At $12, these fries are also quite expensive but like John's uses the expensive Kennebec potato. Despite labeling themselves as French Canadian, don't expect to find poutine at this spot. I feel like I've spent a lot of time describing fries now so I'll just leave it at this, when I put these fries in my mouth, I think it gives me a bigger hit of dopamine than any other spot I tried.  \n\nWell there you have it, everyone. That's my list. I am fully prepared for comments of \"I ate at that place you liked so much and thought it was bad\" which is fine. This is just my opinion, everyone in Chicago that did what I did would probably have a different list. I know people are going to ask what's next, honestly I don't know. Maybe ice cream? Seems like a relatively unexplored area in this city. If I had a car I'd pick tacos but the commutes to the good taco spots would be grueling. I'll probably update this one and my omakase list in a year or two as I try more spots but I'm done ranking fried chicken sandwiches. If you have an idea for what I should obsess over next, I'm open to ideas.\n\nThanks for reading and I love you.\n\n-Mitch",

My fiance follows a rescue in NY. Now in all honesty I have never owned my own horse but my fiance has and is skilled with teaching me the ins and outs of horse care. But when I saw her there was just something that made me say we have to save her. So we did! She was so under weight andThe following photos stary from the day she was delivered to yesterday which is roughly a month and a half. We have her on a diet of alfalfa, triple crown senior grain with rice bran oil, and smart beets. She still has a long way to go but we will get her there! The following photos are from day of delivery up to yesterday (roughly a month and a half) Hopefully you enjoy!

Something clicked in his head (we think the big herd was a atressfactor for him, he seemed happier at the tought of being with 1 or 2 other horses only) and he started being dangerous to other horses and humans. Since the owner owns a therapy stable, she can't keep a dangerous horse around, since not every cliwnt would be able to notice amd react in case a fight broke out, so she had to send him back to the rescue.

You might not be pleased with the change, depending on how you feel about rice bran oil (I need to learn more about it). \n\n**My note to them:**\n\n>Hello,\n \n>I love Chipotle and have eaten at Chipotle restaurants many, many times. However, I really dislike the use of soybean oil in your food. I would love to enjoy your steak, but I stick with the carnitas due to the soybean oil.\n> \nSoybean oil is considered to be unhealthy by many, especially considering the high amounts of omega-6 fats that it contains.\n \n>I know that Chipotle has a huge following in the \"paleo\" community, which is a style of eating based on whole foods like grass-fed beef, and eliminating harmful processed foods and some grains (esp. those that contain gluten). However, it's well-known that only the pork at Chipotle is paleo-friendly. \n\n>Chipotle would generate a ton of good-will from health-conscious folks by elimanating the soy oil and putting steak back on the menu for people like me. \n\n>Best!\n \n>Mike\n\n\n**Their reply:**\n\nMichael,\n \nI'm happy to report that we are on the same page! We are actually working on replacing our soybean oil with non-GMO sunflower oil to fry our taco shells and chips in the following areas and locations:\n \nStores in Washington \n\nStores in Oregon \n\nStores in California \n\nStores in Nevada \n\nStores in Phoenix \n\nStores in Texas \n\nStores in Arkansas \n\nStores in Louisiana \n\nStores in Alabama \n\nStores in Georgia \n\nStores in Tennessee \n\nStores in North Carolina \n\nStores in South Carolina \n\nStores in Virginia \n\nStores in Washington DC \n\nStores in Virginia Beach \n\nStores in Maryland \n\nStores in Philadelphia \n\nStores in Delaware \n\nStores in Massachusetts \n\nStores in Connecticut \n\nStores in Rhode Island \n\nStores in New Hampshire\n\n \nAs of 12/19/11\nAll Florida restaurants, except for the Tallahassee locations\n \nAs of 9/25/11:\nStores in Denver \n\nStores in Utah \n\nStores in Colorado Springs \n\nStores in NYLI \n\nStores in NYC \n\nStores in New Jersey\n \nAs well as our Wilton, Henrietta, Lathamroute, CliftonPark and Univofroch locations.\n \nWe are also making the transition to non-GMO rice bran oil. As of August 24th 2012, the western half of the U.S. began using the rice bran oil in our pinto beans, black beans and adobo marinade. It is important to note that soybean oil is still used in our grills so while our chicken, steak and barbacoa is marinated in the adobo marinade containing rice-bran oil, they may still come into contact with the soy used on our grill. \n\nWe plan to completely replace our soybean oil with our sunflower and rice bran oils. I would recommend asking your local Chipotle to see where they are in this transition as this is an ongoing process. In the meantime, it may be helpful if you knew which offerings could still contain soybean oil before this transition is fully accomplished. The following items are made with soybean oil or contain it from the grill:\n \nChips\n\nCrispy corn taco shells\n\nRice\n\nFajita vegetables\n\nBlack beans\n\nPinto beans\n\nCarnitas\n\nChicken\n\nSteak\n\nBarbacoa\n\nChipotle honey vinaigrette\n\nLarge and Small Flour Tortillas\n \nThe following items are NOT made with soybean oil, although they could possibly come in contact with foods that are. I recommend you carefully consider your dining choices on this as well.\n \nMild tomato salsa\n\n Medium corn-poblano salsa\n\n Green chile tomatillo salsa\n\n Red chile tomatillo salsa\n\n Guacamole\n\n Cheese\n\n Sour cream\n\n Lettuce\n \nI hope this information proves helpful Michael.

I eat at Chipotle A LOT... Probably at least 3 - 4 times a week. I love the food, the freshness, and the ease of being able to carryout my Paleo Diet lifestyle with Chipotle. My only concern is the level of Omega-6 that I intake because of your use of Soy Oil. I was wondering if there has been any research into Chipotle switching to Coconut Oil instead? (I'd vouch for Animal Fat, but that would not help your vegetarian/vegan client base). Any insite into the matter would be great! Thanks so much! \n\nChipotle:\n> Thank you for contacting us to express your concern over our use of soy oil in our restaurants. This is not an aspect of our food's preparation that we are happy with, for a variety of reasons, including the one you mention. There have indeed been tests of alternative oils we could use in our recipes and grilling. Animal fat is not an option we've considered very strongly for the reason you mention. We have tested sunflower oil to very positive results and have high hopes of implementing it on a wider scale in the near future. \n\n> We realize that our food system isn't perfect, and neither are we, but we are invested in making our menu healthier and more sustainable. Thanks for your input and your support of our company. I hope you'll be pleased by the directions we take in the future.\n\nI also asked about it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vzb8k/i_am_a_chipotle_mexican_grill_general_manager/c58yt00) in this deleted IAmA: [I am a Chipotle Mexican Grill General Manager with all the answers.

Think sleeping packs and thick creams.  Petrolatum (Vaseline) is the gold standard, but a good rule of thumb is to go as heavy and occlusive as your skin can handle without clogging pores. \n\n* Many facial oils are not occlusives. Read more about oils and occlusion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3v6yb8/psa_for_your_winter_dryness_most_oils_arent/)\n\n* What occlusive you eventually choose is largely individualized. Some rely on petrolatum-based balms, for others this results in bad breakouts. As always, patch test and add only one new product at a time. \n\n* What works for your skin can rapidly shift depending on climate, season, and region. Pay attention to signs of how your skin is responding to these various factors so you can adjust your routine accordingly. Be ready to change things up\n\n* You might be here because you’ve over exfoliated. You can generally tell this because 1) you just upped your acids, and 2) your skin is newly very sensitive to even mild products. You can read more here on [how to tell if you’ve damaged your moisture barrier.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/33xhax/what_are_the_signs_to_look_out_for_for/) Learn your lesson and when you restart, GO SLOWLY. Many people with lots of acids in their routine got there after sloooowly ramping up and allowing their skin to adjust. And consider [joining a support group ;)]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3tac9m/can_we_have_a_support_group_for_overexfoliators/)\n\n* If your dry skin is new and likely the result of new or increased actives in your routine (especially rein-A and other retinols, BHA, andor AHA) BACK OFF THE ACTIVES until your moisture barrier heals. DO NOT TRY TO “POWER THROUGH.” Scale back on your routine to the bare essentials, focusing on mild products, hydration, and occlusive creams. \n\n* Consider your cleanser. Tightness, dryness, and sensitivity that seems to be resistant to all the layers of hydration and creams may be the result of a cleanser your skin hates. Many with dry skin recommended avoiding foaming cleansers and using a cleansing milk as their second cleanser. Also consider cutting back to once-a-day cleansing, or simply rinsing your face with water. \n\n* Another recommendation was to save washing the face for evening\n\n* Consider eliminating anything that foams. \n\n* Please consider seeing a dermatologist if you can. Topical steroids may be something to consider if your skin is really suffering. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSources:\n\n[Help with Dry Skin and Double Cleansing]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4ca5e2/help_with_dry_skin_and_double_cleansing/)\n\n[Looking for a Gentle, low pH Second Cleanser for Dry Skin!]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4alfwn/looking_for_a_gentle_low_ph_second_cleanser_for/)\n\n[Cure for dry skin for retin a user- Vaseline]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/42zbt5/cure_for_dry_skin_for_retin_a_user_vaseline/)\n\n[Best toner and essence for normal-dry skin?]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/44bnvp/best_toner_and_essence_for_normaldry_skin/)\n\n\n[Looking for a moisturizing mist for winter and dry skin?]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/47ksng/looking_for_a_moisturizing_mist_for_winter_and/)\n\n[Dry skin product recommendations]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3e9yik/dry_skin_product_recommendations/)\n\n[What cushions do you recommend for my dry skin?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/45lue2/what_cushions_do_you_recommend_for_my_dry_skin/)\n\n[Sheet mask recommendation dry skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/38ekvx/sheet_mask_recommendation_dry_skin/)\n\n[Warning: Unpleasant Acne Pictures.

It's also low-ph! I use this as my second cleanser after an oil cleanser. DHC Cleansing Oil works really well. They don't dry me out like a lot of cleansers do.\n\nCleansing is the hardest part to get right for me. But I think the above combo really works, so I'm afraid to change it up much :)\n\nI am absolutely in love with the COSRX Snail Mucin Essence. Also, the Rice overnight pack is actually really good. I've not tried the Honey Ceramide one yet, but I'm loving the Rice pack.\n\nI am not sure how overlapping Dry/Sensitive/OverExfoliation are, because I have dry skin and I find that it's only sensitive when my skin is dehydrated/broken barrier. But I find that my dry skin is mostly happy with anything that moisturises it.",

        "body": "Not AB, but Earth Science has a cream cleanser that I believe is fatty alcohol free and is around pH 5.5. I also plan to try out some non-foaming cleansing gels in order to check out what alternatives are out there for those with drier skin. First on my list is a kose cleansing gel, which I saw was described as weakly acidic. \n  \nAlso, I have dehydrated-prone and acne-prone skin that leans dry. Right now I'm using shea butter as a final step since no other facial oil has worked out for me, and it's going pretty well so far! I have the NOW Foods Shea butter tub. It can be a bit hard to spread, so I stuck a chopstick in and \"whipped\" it for a looser texture. However, it still tugs a bit when being applied to the skin. I found the best way to apply it is to take some of the whipped shea butter in my hand, warm it up and then apply it - either by spreading, or pressing my palms to my face.  \n  \nI've tried all sorts of sleeping packs and oils, but I'm finally waking up with skin that isn't dry or dehydrated. Vaseline also works decently, but shea butter seems to be the right mix of occlusive and emollient for my skin. Over the course of the night, some of it absorbs and I wake up with pretty good skin (much better than before, I can definitely say). I still might go back to playing around with vaseline during the winter months. We'll see how it goes.   \n  \nAnyway, the point of this tangent is that I recommend adding shea butter to the facial oil list haha. I know there's actually a shea oil, but I've never tried it and I believe the components of shea butter that are beneficial for dry skin are removed in the process of making shea oil. So it should be a bit lighter, if anyone is interested in a lighter take on shea butter.   \n  \nLastly, [this post about occlusives](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3v6yb8/psa_for_your_winter_dryness_most_oils_arent/) might be of interest to those with dry skin.   \n  \nETA: Wanted to clarify that I use lots of hydrating layers, but they mean nothing without a good occlusive.   \n  \nEdit: words",

        "body": "Not sure if my skin passes for dry because I usually try to deal with the dryness as soon as it appears and keep it as normal as possible. \n\nThings I use and I have found that work for me: \n\n* Tony Moly Aquaporin Moisture Foam Cleanser - this is a really basic cleanser, it's not even low pH, but I find it very gentle. \n* Vivant Skincare Green Tea Antioxydant Cleanser - this one is the gentlest cleanser I've used, it's low pH but it's so pricey. I will probably replace with Sulwhasoo Snowise next. It's the only cleanser I've used that leaves my skin like I haven't washed it but clean (if you know what I mean... xD). \n\nMy favorite creams for my driest moments during winter are: \n\n* Sulwhasoo Essential Firming Cream - I order sample jars of this on eBay and it comes out very affordable. This is my favorite moisturizer for normal/dry skin. It simply leaves my skin super hydrated and glowing, even if I step all the other steps in my routine. \n* Mizon S-venom Wrinkle Tox Cream - this cream is amazing as an occlusive, I absolutely fell in love with it! It left my skin so amazingly soft and hydrated. \n* Yves Rocher Nutrive Végétal 24h Comfort Nourishing Cream - this is a recent fave, for the price of 12€ for two tubs of this, it's perfect. I really like this line by YR for normal/dry skin, for those of you interested in trying non AB EU skincare, I'd highly recommend them, they are super affordable as well. \n\nMy favorite sleeping pack is: \n\n* Sulwhasoo Overnight Vitalizing Mask - this mask is magic for dry skin and soon as I start using this after getting dry patches they disappear. And it also helps for brighter skin tone. \n\nFavorite facial oil: \n\n* Pure cold-pressed avocado oil - I used this before I started using the Sulwhasoo sleeping mask. A 250 ml costs around 4€ in the supermarket, so I'd highly recommend it to everyone with dry skin. \n\nToner I am using for a while: \n\n* Yves Rocher Nutrive Végétal Velvety Toner - this is a really great locally available toner for me and for the price of 8€ for two bottles, I'd call this a pretty amazing deal. \n\nI am really interested in adding new stuff to my stash. I'd like to get a new toner and at the moment I am really hesitating between the Kikumasamune and the Hadalabo Hyaluronic Acid one, I would love if someone could tell me how they performed for them. \n\nI'd also like to buy serums/essences because I am only using actives at the moment. I am interested in Mizon Hyaluronic Acid Amoule, Cosrx Snail Essence, Cosrx Galactomyces Essence, Scinic Snail AIO, Scinic Propolis Ampoule, basically the choice is hard here. \n\nI've used couple of different gel creams but I don't find they are that amazing for dry skin, just a good thing to layer as a moisturizer. Ones I've used are \n\n* Mizon Watervolume Aqua Gel Cream \n* Mizon Aloe 90 Soothing Gel\n* Mizon Snail Recovery Gel \n* 3W Clinic Snail Mucus Soothing Gel \n\nFavorite sunscreens: \n\n* Bioré UV Perfect Milk - this is really great for dry skin, I imagine it will be my go to sunscreen during winter. \n* Missha All Around Safe Block Waterproof Sun \n\n\nOther random things that worked out for me: \n\n* Layering several layers of moisturizers instead of using one heavy layer of a moisturizing cream. I don't know why exactly that works the way it works, it might have to do something with the skin absorbing the ingredients more easily that way. \n* Careful with actives! It took me 3 months to build a tolerance to be able to use vitamin C daily (and once per day only) so I learned it the hard way, my skin doesn't like too much actives. I only use AHA once/twice per week and my skin looks really great right now. \n\n\nSorry for the non AB suggestions!",

    "body": "I live with a Kevin. A lot of stories for this subreddit.\n\nTo start with, Kevin has a cold. Sneezing, wheezing, and then last night, a sheer panic.\n\n>\"I have brain fluid coming out!\"\n\nTheir nose was running with a watery consistency. Kevin was convinced that they had to go to the ER because \"a doctor told them that it means there's too much pressure in the sinuses and that makes them leak brain fluid\".\n\n*Update:* *I understand that CSF can leak from the sinus and ears with certain conditions. That's not what Kevin has, however - it turns out that it's extra runny because they tried to irrigate their sinus by jetting tap water up their nose.*\n\nThis isn't the first display of Kevin's first amazing medical knowledge.\n\nKevin tried to prove that they could open a Coke can with their teeth. When their initial attempt failed to provide results, they applied more and more force until, with a slip, they smashed themselves in the face with the can. One of Kevin's teeth came out.\n\nKevin's response was nonchalant, they picked up the tooth, opened the can of Coke, and then dropped the tooth into it.\n\nWhy?\n\n>\"A dentist told me that you can put a knocked-out tooth in Coke to keep it safe. It's a really well-known fact, I'm amazed you don't know that.\"\n\nKevin then proceeded to argue about it when told that Coke tends to *dissolve* teeth, which is kind of the opposite of keeping it safe, until they were finally convinced to look it up online.\n\nThen, bragging that we'd be sorry when they could prove they were right, they spent several minutes growing slowly less boastful, before claiming:\n\n>\"I don't know why I can't find it. A dentist really told me that you can keep a tooth in Coke!\"\n\nThey did, finally, pour out the coke, recover their tooth, and put it in a container of milk for the journey to the dentist.\n\nThen there's their worry that I don't drink enough water. I drink a lot of coffee. Kevin the other day wondered aloud how I am still alive.\n\n>\"I never see you drink water, how come you haven't died from dehydration?\"\n\nI do drink water as well, but I highlighted that I mostly drink decaf, and so the caffeine load is so low that there's no diuretic effect. It's just flavoured water.\n\n>\"But it's not water, so you won't make your three to six litres per day!\"\n\nKevin then proceeded to explain, at great length, that you can't stay hydrated unless you drink water. Fruit juice? Coffee? Diet soda? None of that matters, you can only stay alive if you drink water. Coconut water, apparently, *might* get a pass, because \"it's basically so much like water that you can use it for blood transfusions\".\n\n*Update: I am informed that coconut water* can *be used as an IV fluid. The more you know!*\n\nWhich is a whole different package to unwrap that I just haven't had the spoons for. I was, at the time, more concerned about \"three to six litres\". For those using Freedom Units, that about 3/4 to 1 1/2 gallons.\n\nI told Kevin that it's closer to two litres (a half gallon). Slightly more for men than for women, slightly more if you're physically exerting. Their figures were way out there.\n\n>\"Nope! It's between three and six litres. A doctor told me.\"\n\nAs you can probably tell, Kevin is fond of referring to unnamed experts to back up their claims.\n\nKevin was, again, told to check on Google.\n\n>\"Aha! I told you! You need between six and eight litres- wait. Cups. Six to eight cups of water per day? I don't understand.\"\n\nKevin has not yet relented on that one, because they were told that *only* water can hydrate a person. All other drinks do nothing for your fluid levels.\n\nThis isn't much of the wild things Kevin believes, they're a treasure trove of confident absurdity. I'll post more later, it's kind of therapeutic to be able to unpack some of the stuff they've said.\n\n*Update:*\n\nI think I should highlight that despite the difficulty with connecting thoughts to actions they have, they are a wonderful person and despite my frustrations, I mostly worry for them. These aren't intended to make fun of them.\n\nThey're generous and caring to the point of giving the shirt off their back. Literally.\n\nThat said:\n\n• Kevin heard that blue is hotter than red, and have consequently now forgotten how the kitchen tap works due to this confusion. *Update:* *They have used this sink for thirteen years.*\n\n• Kevin tried to use WD40 to cook with, because I unwisely told them that \"any oil would do\" when they asked if they should use peanut, olive, or rice bran oil.\n\n• Kevin unironically believes a youtuber's story about being chased by ninjas and CIA style spies because the youtuber did a segment where they recorded themselves running away from said ninjas, and the ninjas were on the film.\n\n• Kevin is afraid that chicken and soy beans have enough estrogen in it to change their hormonal balance. They are also afraid that the microwave will give them \"eyeball cancer\" if they look at it while it's turned on.\n\n• Kevin's power bill share is astronomically higher than mine, because they like to leave the heater on in their room. They close neither door nor window when doing so. On those occasions when it gets too hot for them, rather than turning it off, they turn the ceiling fan on. Kevin also gets mad if I turn these off while they're out.\n\n• Kevin had to be intercepted from telling the woman with missing teeth about what valuables they have and when their next paycheque comes in, when said woman came knocking at the door at half past midnight.\n\n• Kevin wanted to put a sign on the shared toilet door so that there wouldn't be accidental walk-ins. When I told them that the door has a lock, they wanted to know how the lock would know if people are in there. I mistakenly thought that was a joke at first, but then they got mad at me for laughing, because \"locks are serious business, you have to be a locksmith to understand these things\".\n\n• Kevin had to be restrained from trying to climb a burning tree because they wanted to see if any birds needed rescuing in the branches above. Kevin had, it turned out, forgotten they can fly.\n\n• Kevin thinks that periods are a sign of a woman's organs malfunctioning, that after a month of building up toxic substances, they pee out blood for a few days.\n\n• Kevin was convinced that they got drunk from a spaghetti I made because they saw my cooking wine. I didn't use the wine in the spaghetti, I just needed to make room in the fridge.\n\n*More updates:*\n\n• Kevin holds their breath when getting a lift from me, whenever the car is driving around corners. It's because \"the air might get moved in too hard and get to (their) brain\".\n\n• Kevin was upset because their drink didn't cool down in the fridge. They had it in a closed, insulated cup. They then got upset when it was pointed out that the insulation stops heat. \"But it isn't about heat, it's about cold!\"",

Infections absolutely make the pressure go up. CSF has a watery texture and tastes sweet or salty or metallic. It does not feel like snot, I can tell the difference.

The tl;dr is:\n\n* **Kuramoto Bijin Komeyu Rice Bran Oil** – My favorite of the bunch. Medium weight, versatile, seems to calm redness in addition to providing emollients\n\n* **Stratia Fortify** – Very nourishing and gentle oil. I love the texture and consistency but it has a real funky smell\n\n* **Herbivore Botanicals Lapis** – HATE the packaging. Oil is meh\n\n* **Blossom Jeju Camellia Soombi Essence Oil** – Smells great, does nothing\n\n* **Acure Organics Marula Oil** – Lightweight oil. Kind of meh but very usable\n\n* **2Sol Turn Up Rejuvenation Retinol** – This is an AB product that follows in the footsteps of Sunday Riley Luna and Mortar & Pestle Retinol Night Oil in that it's a retinol product with an oil delivery system. Super emollient and gentle, works great under eyes. Effects of retinol have yet to be seen though\n\nHave you guys have any face oils that have especially blown you away?",

        "body": "If the Kuramoto oil is 100% cold pressed rice bran oil... Why not just buy rice bran oil? You can get a giant bottle for cheap.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI don't think Fortify smells bad at all. It just smells like unrefined oils. If you're used to refined oils or oils that have fragrance (yuck) then it can take some getting used to but to me it just smells nutty and the way oils are supposed to smell. I know I'm getting all the benefits.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI just can't bring myself to buy 95% of facial oils though honestly. You can make the exact thing at home for a fraction of the cost and I do just that. I actually prefer mine because I can use exactly what I want to use. I like to use fruit seed oils because they're super light, packed with antioxidants, and high in linoelic acid.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFortify is a good example of the 5% of facial oils I will buy. True Camellia Japonica oil (not green tea oil which everyone tries to pass off as it) is hard to find and expensive. Squalene and borage can also be pricey. So Fortify is an amazing deal (especially with 20% off) and I can't DIY it for cheaper. So facial oils with rare ingredients or ingredients that would cost me a lot to buy myself are worth buying vs DIYing. But most facial oils are easy to dupe and brands bank on consumer ignorance.",

I have to hold the Lapis oil at a certain angle to get it to actually dispense, while the roller ball I have from Evan Healy dispenses a ton of product easily. I will say I had better luck with the oil than you did, as it reduced all of the redness I had on my cheeks (blue tansy is great anti-inflammatory), but I'm going to have to splurge on the larger dropper bottle if I rebuy.\n\nFunny enough, I think the sour scent you mentioned is actually caused by whatever they've made the roller ball bit from (as if you needed another strike against the packaging). I had a sample from Sephora I was testing out, so I was able to directly compare the scent of the rollerball and the bottle version. The bottled version smells amazing - like blue tansy oil (herbal, sweet, floral) and jasmine tea, while the roller ball version smells really muted and slightly sour in comparison, even after the oil's been dispensed. If you see it in store, it's worth smelling just to see how different it is.\n\nI saw you mentioned buying from Shea Terra in the comments: I'm current mixing their carrot seed oil with Stratia's liquid gold, and it's saving my skin this winter. I think I've sampled most of their oils at this point, and right now the carrot seed and yangu oils are my standouts for dry skin. (Their black cumin seed oil is also nice for skin/hair/scalp, but it's got a leaky dropper and a very strong scent, so it's harder to recommend.)",

    "body": "Why hello! There’s a huge influx of new members now, and quite of few of you guys are also brand new to indies! While it seems like it should be a no-brainer, sometimes the transition from mainstream to indie can be a little confusing. And sometimes you may have a question (I’ve gotten several!) that you want to ask but don’t want to seem like you’re oblivious. So I’m compiling this short little FAQ of some common questions that people new to indies may have. If you’ve got a question, feel free to throw it my way and I’ll try to answer it (or someone else will) and it’ll be added to the post! Yay!\n\n**What is TAT?**\n\nTAT stands for turnaround time. This is the time it takes from you placing your order to your order being shipped out to you, also known as processing time. \n\n**How long is TAT?**\n\nThere is no universal length for TAT, so judging one company against the policies of another is a fast track to Sad Town. Some shops have a stated TAT of 1-3 days, while others state it can be up to 30 days between you ordering and your order being shipped. You’ll need to pay attention to the TAT, otherwise you may think that your order’s late when it’s really right within the shop’s stated TAT.\n\n**Does TAT include the weekend?**\n\nFor most shops, no. The number of days listed in the TAT will often explicitly state that these are business days. Business days are Monday through Friday. Holidays are not business days. Saturday does NOT count as a business day. So here’s an example!\n\nYou’ve placed an order on Thursday, December 18th with a shop with a stated TAT of 7 business days. That means that your order would need to ship by December 30th. The Christmas holiday falls into that time, and there are two weekends as well. Understanding TAT can help avoid impending heartbreak if a gift doesn’t arrive in time. So make sure you pay close attention to the shop’s TAT! Usually, it will be listed on the home page or within the FAQ. If you’re unsure, it’s probably wise to email the shop owner prior to placing an order!\n\n**Something is wrong with my order. Can I just post here for help?**\n\nAbsolutely you can ask for help with an order from the folks of IMAM! However, it’s really, really, REALLY recommended that you contact the shop owner first. Most of the time, they’re better equipped to answer your question than other customers are. Don’t ever be afraid to ask something or note that something’s not quite what you wanted!\n \n**How many people work at these companies?**\n\nIndie shops are often one or two person operations. Sometimes you’ll find that you don’t get a response to an email right away, or you’ll notice your invoices have the same handwriting all the time. That’s because these are tiny operations, often times within someone’s home or a small office elsewhere. One of the most important lessons you learn when you switch from mainstream to indie is that patience is indeed a virtue. Because products are often made as orders come in, or shops operate on very small stock, it can take a while to get through orders, especially without extra help and while working another primary job as many indie owners do. So, patience! Yeah!\n\n**How safe is buying indie?**\n\nAbout as safe as buying anything else. The overwhelming majority of reputable indies take sanitation and consumer safety very seriously. Shops have sterilization routines in place, and should some kind of contamination happen, most are quick to do a recall and announce a warning. As far as credit card safety, most indies use a third-party payment gateway to process cards and thus don’t ever have your credit card information on hand.\n\n**How do I know what a reputable indie shop is?**\n\nResearch research research! If you see a shop posted about frequently, and the interactions are overwhelmingly positive, you can feel safe shopping from that store. If you find a random shop on Etsy with no sales and no information anywhere else, use your best judgment. Some people opt to make a post on IMAM asking if anyone has experience with an unknown shop, and often times there are a few people who have taken that leap and just didn’t post about it. My advice is to choose a more well-known shop for your first few indie purchases before wading out into deeper water to avoid being possibly scammed/disappointed/angered.\n\n**What is [x product]?**\n\nYou’ll probably see a lot of commonly-referenced items in posts and it might be confusing. These items are usually some sort of base or fixative for eyeshadows, and they can be super helpful when working with loose shadows for the first time. So here’s a brief overview of the most common!\n\n* *Fyrinnae Pixie Epoxy* – Pixie Epoxy, sometimes shortened to PE, makes an appearance in a large number of swatch posts or EOTD/FOTD (eye/face of the day) looks. PE acts as a sticky base to help loose shadows and glittery things look their best. You'll want to give PE a little time to dry first before putting on your shadow (thanks, /u/infamousjoe!). It’s almost universally loved and is fairly simple to use. You may still want to find a primer to use beneath PE for added longevity.\n* *Darling Girl Glitter Glue* – You’ll find that people tend to use one or the other between PE and GG. They have the same purpose: allowing your sparkly shadows to stay put. GG might be a little bit more complicated, though, as you may need to let it dry for a bit before putting your shadow on. A primer beneath this sticky base may be needed.\n* *Darling Girl Primped & Primed Primer* – This primer acts similarly to mainstream eye primers. However, it can be tricky to work with. The temptation to scoop out quite a bit is great, but you really only need the very lightest amount. Adding more than just one quick tap from your fingertip can lead to creasing. This primer has a slightly steeper learning curve than others.\n* *Darling Girl Superstar Serum* – This isn’t a primer or a base, but is a helpful tool! Superstar Serum can be mixed with shadow to make a really awesome liquid liner solution. Just don’t squirt the serum right into your loose shadow jar. Tap a little shadow out onto a clean surface, then mix in a drop or two of the Superstar Serum. Stir it up with a toothpick or a brush and voila! Foiled liner!\n* *NYX Milk* – If you’re anything like me, you will have no idea what the hell this is despite seeing it in swatch posts everywhere. It’s a pencil. Now you don’t have to fake knowing! Milk is just a white eye pencil that many people use to make the color of their loose shadows stand out more.\n* *NYX Black Bean* – The opposite of Milk, Black Bean provides a dark base for shadows. Which NYX pencil you use really depends on personal preference.\n\n**Do I have to have a base/primer?**\n\nNo, you don’t. You don’t HAVE to do anything. To get the best look out of your loose shadows, though, I’d recommend nabbing at least one sticky base and one primer. They don’t have to be indie to work, so if you’ve already got a beloved primer or base, keep on using it!\n\n**What is [x acronym]?**\n\nSometimes acronyms pop up and it can be confusing. So let’s try and tackle some now!\n\n* AA - Alchimia Apothecary\n* BPAL - Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab (thanks, /u/hlg17!)\n* BV - Black Violet (thanks, /u/Kittytub!)\n* DC – Darling Clandestine\n* DE – Dawn Eyes\n* DG – Darling Girl\n* DH/DWH – Dreamworld Hermetica\n* FF – Femme Fatale\n* GDE – Glamour Doll Eyes\n* HG - holy grail, or a top, beloved product (thanks, /u/weintertwined!)\n* HoG - Haus of Gloi (Thanks /u/12oo!)\n* HW – Hello Waffle\n* LE – Life’s Entropy, but also used for limited edition\n* MPZ – My Pretty Zombie\n* SS – Solstice Scents\n\n**What is perfume oil? How is it different from regular perfume?**\n\nThe vast majority of indie scent companies opt to sell perfume oils rather than regular spray perfume that mainstream users are used to. It can be a bit intimidating trying to navigate these lovely-smelling waters, so I'll try and lay it out as best I can.\n\nA key difference between mainstream perfumes and indie perfume oils is in what's holding the scent together. In mainstream perfumes, scents float around with perfumer's alcohol. This alcohol is really fine and thus easily sprayed from your typical spray packaging. Scents in perfume oils, on the other hand, do their swimming around in--shocker!--oil. Oil is thicker and thus doesn't work so well with a sprayer. The sprayer tends to get clogged, and so you'll find perfume oils come in amber glass jars and you will have to dab the scent on rather than spray.\n\nAlcohol-based perfumes often times have higher sillage (the distance a scent travels from you to another nose, also known as throw). So, where an alcohol-based perfume may be detectable across the room, an oil-based perfume may only be noticeable at a more intimate distance, such as arm's length or whisper distance. \n\nOn the flip side, oil-based scents may last longer than alcohol-based. The alcohol-based scent may evaporate after a few hours, but an oil-based scent can last six or more hours, with some really pushing dangerously close to wearing out their welcome and clinging for days.\n\nThis isn't to say every alcohol-based perfume can be smelled farther away than every oil-based perfume, or every oil-based perfume lasts longer than every alcohol-based perfume. Lots of other factors, such as skin chemistry, notes used, and specific brands, can play a part in how long your perfume oil lasts.\n\n**What do you mean by skin chemistry?**\n\nThis is a fun one for me because I find this fascinating! Have you ever noticed how one eyeshadow or lip color can look a certain way on you but totally different on someone else? Thanks, skin tones and undertones! With scent, the same kind of thing happens. Everyone's skin chemistry, or the way their body reacts to a scent, is different, so you'll have vastly different experiences from one person to the next, all with the same scent. Example time again!\n\nOne of my first indie purchases was Jailbait from Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab. On me, the scent is a very lovely cherry scent that fades into a more adult, seductive scent. I wore Jailbait pretty much daily in college. However, I've seen people mention that Jailbait on them turns into a cloying orange scent and never changes. Skin chemistry!\n\nFlip side? Southern Gothic from sixteen92 is a favorite among many users here. For me, unfortunately, it goes horribly wrong and I can only smell BO and sadness.\n\nIt doesn't only apply to what smells good or what smells bad. Some people's skin amps up certain notes while not even allowing other notes to be great. For instance, someone's skin could amplify a cinnamon note in a perfume oil, while completely ignoring the floral notes in that same blend.\n\nReading perfume reviews is quite fun when you see how people's skin reacts to certain things. Eventually, you may start to notice reviewers who's skin acts similarly to your own and you can kind of compare notes! SCIENCE!\n\n**What's a carrier oil?**\n\nRemember when I talked about fragrance swimming around in oil? The oil housing the oil is known as a carrier. Indie perfume shops use different carrier oils based on their own preferences. Some common carrier oils include sweet almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, jojoba oil, and rice bran oil.\n\n**Why are perfume oils in amber/cobalt glass?**\n\nPerfume oils are sensitive to light. Exposure to too much light can cause the oils within to break down. This means the scent loses potency quickly and can even turn pretty funktastic. To try and help lessen that, most indie shops use amber glass or cobalt glass to try and filter light out. If you want to help your bottle out even more, store it in a dimly lit area!\n\n**How do I wear perfume oil?**\n\nYou'd think it would be kind of intuitive, but if you're just to just pressing a pump and then smelling fabulous,  an oil can be confusing. There is no wrong way to wear your perfume oil, assuming you don't just dump the whole bottle onto yourself. I mean, you could do that, but it's not really recommended. For oils with no dropper in place, one of the easiest methods is placing a fingertip over the opening, making sure you're covering it fully to avoid spillage, then turning it over briefly. When you remove your fingertip, there will be a decent amount of oil left and you can rub it wherever you'd like! Some people also just rub some oil from the lid in order to get a small amount. If your oil bottle does have a stopper, you can just tap the bottom of the bottle until a drop pops out.\n\nI hope this is helpful to at least a handful of you! This is by no means comprehensive so if you still have questions, ask! Please enjoy your trip down the rabbit hole. Tip your waitress!\n",

I had the chance to be able to help someone, and it made me feel very happy. I walked home smiling, got on my phone that second and typed this down so as to never forget it and in hopes that maybe, someone out there is feeling happy knowing I was happy, or better yet, the woman or someone in her family sees this somehow and they reach out. I wouldn't have provided unnecessary details if I hadn't truly desired to connect back with her. \n\nI understand currency, I understand that attention is a valuable currency people seek, validation, etc. But is it really worth questioning a simple act of kindness as if it were some kind of attention grab or cries for a pat on the back? It doesn't cause anyone any harm even if I DID want my community to say a little 'good job' to me, that makes me very happy and I thank them. \n\nYou know this is a community subreddit, not a YouTube comment section, a large majority of us have seen each other out there unknowingly, and I'm a real person with feelings.",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

    "body": "I had, as the title says, a fairly mediocre experience with Death and Floral. They’re not terrible scents, they just largely didn’t work on me or have a lot of depth. I’m posting these reviews because I’ve seen a lot of people express the desire to see more negative or critical reviews. \n\n**Buying experience**: I ordered a sample pack of 4 for $16 with free shipping. I ordered on July 8th, something like a week before samples stopped being offered, actually. I also received two free samples, in scents I picked. I got a shipping confirmation August 3rd, which is a 17 business day turnaround time--maybe slightly outside the listed TAT? I honestly do not remember what TAT was at the time I ordered. \n\n**Sample details:** All samples are in little 1 ml dropper bottles with plain labels with the name of the scent. I think these are rice bran oil, before they got switched to fractionated coconut oil, but I’m not sure. They came in a little gold lame drawstring bag. It smelled like one of them may have leaked slightly in the mail, maybe Nothing Rusts, but it wasn’t enough to make the other samples oily or deplete the fill level. \n\n**Testing method:** I rested these a week at a time, pulling them out to sniff and apply one every week. I don’t usually rest scents this long, but they were very flat when they arrived. It took until 4 weeks of rest before I felt like they were full enough perfumes to test. For these tests, I smeared a pretty big patch of oil on my wrists. (These dropper wands applied a LOT of oil for me.) Unlike most of my tests, I did not do 2 rounds of wear for each scent--many were unpleasant on me. \n\n**About my perfume preferences:** My favorite genres are warm woods/ambers/vanillas and outdoorsy, earthy green/garden/field scents. I like many florals, citrus, fruits, incenses, and musks, but as supporting notes, not the main driver of a scent. Leathers and aquatics can be iffy on me. I strongly dislike clean and soapy fragrances. On the scale of hyperrealism vs. perfumey abstraction, I prefer realism. Some favorite perfumes include Solstice Scents Manor, Sixteen92 Cotton Mather, and Sonoma Scent Studio Winter Woods. \n\n**Reviews**\n\n* **I was born a bitch, I was born a painter** (Sweet basil and violets, blended with Spanish moss, yarrow oil, and blue musk): I like garden scents, but this one was instantly soap city on me, and I strongly dislike soapy scents. Basil and soap on application, and soapier and soapier on drydown. Violets and moss both have soap potential on me, so it’s not a terrible surprise. \n\n* **Mountain cats will come to drag away your bones** (Pepper, laurel leaf, wood, musk, tobacco, amber, fresh mountain air): I rarely wash off scents, even if I dislike them, but this one was an absolute scrubber. It mostly smelled of this very strong screechy metallic note, probably the “fresh mountain air”--definitely different from both Calone and ozone that are commonly used to create an impression of freshness though. There were maybe some hints of bay and tobacco, no pepper whatsoever. Rarely is a scent so starkly unpleasant. \n\n* **Nothing rusts in the desert, the air is full of ghosts** (Pink cactus flowers and sweet grass, with notes of warm rain and woody dry vanilla): Perhaps it’s because I don’t have familiarity with desert scents, but this was the most indistinct and bath product-like of all the scents I tried. It opens with a clean sweet pink floral scent backed by a faint grassy-vanillic coumarin. As it dries, the vanilla comes out more. It’s not unpleasant, but doesn’t have much character to it. It also was the faintest and least long-lasting scent--only about 3.5 hours on me before it faded to indistinct vanillicness. \n\n* **She plucked our hearts fresh from the grove and served them up for supper** (Earthy figs and warm sun dried tomatoes, blended with lush honeysuckle): I was hoping for more garden vibes, but this is a fairly conventional fruity-floral. On application, there’s a fruity-leaning fig,and a pretty, clean yellow floral. (I am not super well-acquainted with honeysuckle.) There’s a neat plum skin effect in the first few minutes. Sadly, no sun-dried tomatoes at all for me--I even stuck my nose in a jar just to check for any resemblance. Within a half hour, the fig is gone, but the honeysuckle lasts on. Unfortunately, it also goes slightly soapy on my skin as it wears. \n\n* **The sweater we buried you with is hanging in my closet** (A luscious blend of three different vanillas, resinous amber, Arabian sandalwood, a soft cashmere sweater): Probably the one that worked best on me out of the whole batch. A smooth, sweet vanilla and white amber scent with a little bit of nutty sandalwood in the background. Not smoky in the least, and doesn’t have a lot of layers or body to me. The vanilla and white amber are similar to NAVA Eternal Ankh, but less sharp, ethereal, and textured. I prefer more wood and more texture out of this genre of scent--Solstice Scents Manor or NAVA Ember Vanilla are better perfumes in my book, but Sweater would be good for those who want something very smooth and well-blended. Decent projection, and lasted a good 6 hours, notably longer than most of the others. \n\n* **Two cups of tea, a summer monsoon, and me and you** (Rain on cracked soil, wet creosote, a swelling monsoon, desert cedar, black tea): Oh, I wish this worked better on me, because this is probably the most interesting of the sample set. Again, I don’t have the palate for what a desert smells like, but I get a clean petrichor note accompanied by something faintly floral and earthy, with watery black tea around the edges. This isn’t a hyperrealistic atmospheric in the way that Solstice Scents or Sixteen92 can produce, but rather  a more perfumey interpretation. It’s fresh, with little nuances in the scent I wanted to sniff out. Deeply unfortunately: This one also went soapy on drydown. \n\n**Overall thoughts**\nBased on how this spectrum of scents went on me, I don’t think I’ll be trying Death and Floral again. Between the incredibly long rest time necessary, the propensity to go soapy on me, and a more clean/perfumey leaning style, I found myself disappointed. They’re not terrible, particularly for the price, but Death and Floral is just not for me. That’s what I get for buying into the hype, I suppose!",

I always appreciate seeing \"meh\" and \"no way - NOT for me\" posts, especially in a time of excitement over a house, collection, etc ... honesty and balance are so important.  \n\nI think we had similar experiences, as I wasn't overly impressed with the samples I received back in June (definitely the old formula, because I believe I received them before D&F even announced they would be switching over). I can't comment on the new formula just yet, but I do have a custom and a small EDP coming my way soon. I decided to buy again / give D&F another try for a few reasons ... A) I'm really interested in a lot of the customs, new releases, etc. I see coming out, and B) It's my hope that the new formula may give me a better hit rate. If not, I have no issues with giving up on trying a brand, if the hit rate isn't good enough to warrant continued experimentation.\n\nI posted my reviews [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/i5gtqb/2020_my_year_of_indie_exploration_part_1_death/), about a month ago. I like and wear Nothing Rusts in the Desert, and I kept (but I don't reach for them very often) The Sweater We Buried You With and Two Cups of Tea. I'm mildly annoyed by Sweater at this point ... I was not impressed initially, but 1.5 months in (when I posted my review), I tried it again and fell in love (like - finally! Sandalwood! Cashmere!). Now, a month later? It's flat again, and fades SO quickly. Idk, I might be giving up on this one. \n\nI didn't dislike Swamp Elixir or The Secret of Wives and Widows, but they were pretty \"meh\" for me, so I destashed.

This turns the once healthy polyunsaturated fat in to something far less healthy [link to source](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/trans-fat). The things that would typically have trans-fats are margarine, shortening, and very commonly fried foods.\n\nTo me, even in your own arguement, it would make more sense to blame the over consumption of carbs on obesity than it would be to blame polyunsaturated fats.

        "body": "Actually, most of the land we use for growing crops is used to feed the livestock people consume. We could feed the world's starving population several times over with the grains we give to livestock. Industrial agriculture as a whole is extremely damaging to many ecosystems, but it's actually factory farming that is consuming more land and crops than anything else right now. In many third world countries, meat is considered a luxury and grains/root vegetables/fruits are what people can readily produce and survive off of affordably. \n\nMost cows need to eat 24 pounds of grain a day, or 2% of their body weight. \n\nIf you're eating livestock, most people would need about an acre each for their cattle/pigs/chickens/etc., and enough land for their produce/grains. Someone who only consumes vegetables and fruits (grains included) needs about half an acre. There simply isn't enough land at least in the United States for 400 million people to each have their own acre to have grass-fed, personal farms for livestock. This is where we come to the issue of factory farming. \n\nIf you're worried about overuse of the land and wasting precious grains, the best thing you can do is start your own farm/garden and give up meat and dairy, as this is actually a luxury we're granted, at least in my country. But that's not something most people like to hear because it would mean giving up meat and dairy. We don't need meat or dairy to survive, but it's the taste, inconvenience, loss of tradition or customs, and necessity to learn a new way of supplementing things like zinc, iron, etc. from plant sources that intimidates people and allows them to give in to their own selfish ideologies about dominion over other animals. \n\nIf it were only humans consuming the grains we are producing worldwide, I could understand your sentiments. But in reality, we take grains from third world countries who are denied the right to consume those grains they produced in their own countries because they have to be shipped worldwide to feed the livestock in factory farms, so people in first world countries like America, can have access to meat and dairy products. If there weren't factory farms to feed, that grain would be used to feed human beings. I could go on and on, but I hope you see the point.",

    "body": "**Skin Type:** dry, sensitive, easily dehydrated; not acne-prone\n\n**Climate:** Dry, Northern California weather\n\n**Ingredients that I found out I’m allergic/sensitive to:** lanolin, nickel, triethanolamine, methylisothiazolinone, chemical sunscreen, macadamia nut oil, and snail ☹ (I can’t believe how sensitive my skin is, considering I don’t even have pollen/food allergies that I know of).\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI ventured into AB last year due to my very dry and dehydrated face. I’ve always had dry skin but when I moved from SoCal to NorCal last year, my face became more dry, itchy, and flaky especially when the weather got colder. I loved the sun in SoCal and never used sunscreen on my face (I know it’s bad). I also did not care much about my face and only used water or shower gel for cleansing after using make up remover wipes. I also did not use lotion/moisturizers.\n\nIn the past months of trying out products and reading this subreddit, I have learned so much and realized the importance of low pH cleansers, patch testing, moisturizing, etc. Despite dealing with contact dermatitis a couple times and more whiteheads or pimples than before, and having to restart my routine again and again, I am enjoying this trial and error process.\nHere are some mini-reviews of the products I’ve used so far. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Current Products:**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Epielle Facial Cleansing tissues** – I have been using this make up remover wipes for years without realizing that it is made in Korea. It works well with removing most of my waterproof eyeliner before I wash my face. The one in white packaging does not contain alcohol and sodium laureth sulfate. It has cucumber extract, green tea extract, and aloe vera extract, but I think that gets washed off anyways. I use it because it is cheap ($1-$1.50) and it is easily available in Big Lots, Grocery Outlet, and online. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Innisfree The Minimum Cleansing Lotion** – This is my current first cleanser. I put it in cotton pads and soak my eyeliner with it. It easily removes the remaining eyeliner residue without making my eyes burn. It leaves an oily feel on my skin, so I use a second cleanser after this. It is great for sensitive and dry skin since it is alcohol and sulfate-free, but it has cetearyl alcohol, which some people are sensitive to.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Cow Brand Gyunyu Non-Additive Cleansing Milk** – This cleansing milk is advertised as a make up remover that contains natural palm oil and olive squalene. It is alcohol-free, sulfate-free, and fragrance-free. It is non-foaming and very gentle. It feels “silky” on my skin but does not leave an oily feel. However, it does not easily remove my eyeliner (and that’s why I use make up remover wipes first). This also works as a morning/second cleanser and that’s how I prefer to use it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Innisfree Jeju Bija Anti-Trouble Cleansing Gel** – I have only been testing this cleanser for 2 weeks and so far, I haven’t noticed any problems from it. I use this as a second cleanser after Innisfree the minimum cleansing lotion. My face does not feel dry or stripped of oil after using this. It does have a strong “pine-like” smell if you are sensitive to fragrances. Is this really discontinued or not?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Kikumasamune High Moist Lotion** – This watery toner smells like sake at first but that smell dissipates quickly (I actually like that sake smell). This is my first ferment product and my skin seems to like it. My skin just seems to absorb the product easily. I use 3-5 layers of this depending on how lazy I am. The ceramides in it must have helped my skin recover post contact dermatitis from Rosette ceramide gel and Cosrx snail cream. It was amazing to see my skin change from dry, red, flaky and itchy to smooth, moisturized skin. As you know, it comes in such a huge bottle so you get so much of the product for the price. The pump on the bottle sucks, so I put it on a spray bottle. I use it on my body too and my legs are no longer flaky this winter. I also just started using this on my scalp after washing my hair as suggested by some on this subreddit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**COSRX Oil-Free Ultra Moisturizing Lotion with Birch Sap** – I actually suggested this to my boyfriend who has oily skin and hates using spatula for moisturizers. He loved it! I tried it because I did not have another moisturizer after dealing with contact dermatitis. Thankfully, it is gentle and did not cause burning on my dry, dehydrated, red skin. This and the Kikumasamune high moist lotion helped my face recover and my flaking itchy skin is gone. It is also not as light as I thought because it really keeps my skin moisturized for several hours. I’ve only been using this for 2 weeks, so I’m still keeping an eye for possible breakout from cetearyl alcohol (I haven’t used much products with it) but so far so good. Take note that it is not entirely oil-free. It has lemon peel oil and tea tree leaf oil at the end of its ingredient list (most likely in small amounts).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**COSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch and Nexcare 3M Acne dressing** – These pimple patches just work so well! I love seeing how it absorbs the pus out of pimples and whiteheads. Cosrx is more expensive than Nexcare 3M but I think they are both very similar and effective.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Beauty Treats face masks** – I got these sheet masks from Daiso for $1.50 each. These masks have no alcohol, parabens, or fragrance and have minimal ingredients. These are soaked with essence, fit well on my face, and very soothing. Honestly, I think there’s not much difference between the different masks of this brand. The ingredients are mostly similar – all of them have hyaluronic acid, arbutin, cucumber extract, green tea extract, aloe vera extract and vitamin E. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**[non-AB] H&B Oils Center 100% unrefined, cold pressed rice bran oil** – I bought this to make sure that I am not going to have a bad skin reaction from rice bran oil since I want to buy the Kuramoto Bijin rice bran oil. So far, I am using this on my scalp and hair after washing my hair. This helps the ends of my hair look silky and less dry.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Products I will not repurchase:**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n•\t**Cure Natural Aqua Gel** - My very first AB product purchase since my first visit in Japan. I wanted to see if it really removes dead skin or if it was just a gimmick. Turned out that it was just a waste of money and I finally stopped using it after realizing that it makes my skin dry and itchy afterwards. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Cleansing Foam** – This was my first AB cleanser without enough research. My face felt so dry and stripped after my first use and I immediately stopped it. I later found out that it is a high pH cleanser. Everyone should definitely avoid this product.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Mizon Water Volume EX first essence** – I bought this without knowing what a first essence really is. It is a watery essence and it feels refreshing when you pat it on your face. It did not really cause me any problems but I stopped using this because I don’t think it was really doing anything for my skin.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Secret Key Aloe Soothin Moist Toner** – I thought this was going to be a gentle toner since it really felt like water. It did not feel refreshing, soothing, or moisturizing. It was just like tap water. I stopped using this when I started having mild itching every time I used it. I later found out that it contained snail secretion filtrate, which my skin is allergic to.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Dear by Enprani Moistfull Booskin** – I am so glad that I did not buy the full size of this toner (which is huge!). It contains so much plant extracts that I don’t even know what my skin reacted to. I only patch tested it for a week but it caused my skin to have red bumps, itching, and whiteheads. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Lotion** – This passed my patch testing but when I used it on my full face after 1 week, my face was the most dehydrated it had ever been. I used this on damp face and layered a moisturizer on it but it gave me whiteheads, dry, flaky, and itchy skin. I’m guessing my dry skin did not like the amount of hyaluronic acid in this. I was very disappointed that it didn’t work for me since a lot of people rave about it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**O Hui Miracle Moisture Skin Softener moist** – This hydrating toner was actually amazing. I found out through this product that my face loves ceramides. It made my skin smooth and bouncy, but it is pricier than other toners with ceramides, highly fragranced (like a strong perfume, which I don’t like), and I found out that denatured alcohol was 3rd on its ingredient list. If you don’t mind its price and fragrance, I think it is a good hydrating toner for dry skin.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Etude House Moistfull Collagen Emulsion** – This was the first AB moisturizer I bought because it was highly recommended by Sokoglam. It actually made my face moisturized, my face felt smooth and did not have flaking. However, something in this emulsion was causing me multiple whiteheads around my lips and on my chin (possibly hydrogenated vegetable oil, alcohol, or fragrance?). It also smelled too “perfumey” and there are so much more better AB moisturizers that I wanted to try.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**O Hui Miracle Moisture Emulsion** – Something in this product caused my face to feel like it was burning and made my skin flushed whenever I used it. It also left me with dry, itchy skin on the few days I used it. Unfortunately, I cannot find its ingredients anywhere.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Mizon Water Volume EX cream** – This is a blue colored gel moisturizer instead of a “cream” consistency. It was refreshing to use and felt “cool” on my face. It did not provide me with enough hydration though. By mid-day, my face was already dry again and craving for some moisture. I gave it to my boyfriend who has oily face and he liked it as a day moisturizer. It has high alcohol content, so it is probably not good for people with dehydrated skin. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Rosette Ceramide Gel** – This gel felt sticky when I applied it on my face but absorbed after 5-10 minutes. You don’t need to apply a lot of product for your whole face and neck. It initially made my face feel smooth and nicely moisturized. After almost 2 weeks of using this, I thought I already have my HG moisturizer. Then, I noticed that my jaw got itchy. I ignored it, and then my forehead got itchy. The more times I used it, my face got increasingly itchy, but I was in denial that it was the culprit. “My face loves ceramides, so it can’t be this!” Until, I applied it once more and my face got red and itchy just a few minutes after. I developed contact dermatitis possibly from the macadamia nut oil in it. My face was red, flaky, and dehydrated and I was so devastated because this gel has so much ceramides and I love its packaging. YMMV for sure.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**COSRX Advanced Snail 92 All in One cream** – I was hesitant to use snail products because I was worried that I am allergic to it. Despite not knowing if I am allergic to dust mites, I just had a feeling that my skin won’t like snail but everyone raves about snail! So, I bought this and applied it on my right cheek. This is like a thick gel that has a slimy texture. A little amount goes a long way. My face absorbed the product easily too and I was really hoping that this would work for me. After one day, my nose felt very dry and I felt like I’m going to have a cold. I thought it was weird because I spent the past few days at home and was not exposed to anyone who was sick. The next day, I have full on runny nose. Four days later, I still had a runny nose (with clear drainage which is unlike a common cold where you get yellow snot – sorry if this grosses you out) and I had red bumps, redness, and itching on my right cheek after applying cosrx snail cream. I stopped using it immediately and felt relief from Benadryl cream. My “cold” also miraculously disappeared after I stopped using it. Well, looks like no more snail products for me ☹\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Shiseido Senka Aging Care UV sunscreen** - The first day I used it, at the end of the day, my face felt dry and it already gave me red bumps on my cheek, where I don’t usually get pimples. Those red bumps disappeared the next day when I stopped using the sunscreen, so they were not even pimples. This sunscreen actually felt nice to apply on my face though and dried matte, but I honestly won’t try it again.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Canmake Mermaid UV gel** – I thought I’d give an alcohol-free sunscreen a try thinking that maybe the high alcohol content in Shiseido Senka sunscreen made me dry and broke me out. This did not feel oily on skin and also dried matte. There was a very slight white cast but not that noticeable on my skin. On day 2 of patch testing it, my cheek had red bumps that did not look like pimples. These bumps also disappeared as soon as I stopped using this. So, I think I might be sensitive to chemical sunscreen. The search for a face sunscreen continues.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Products I look forward to testing:**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Matsuyama Hydrating Toner** – It contains 5 types of CERAMIDES! and fermented soybean! I got this from Amazon global japan and I just started patch testing it. It is watery but has a thin slimy feel to it. So far, my left cheek is feeling very smooth without flaking, even without a moisturizer on top of it. I really like its packaging too. It comes in a nice glass bottle that makes it feel more expensive than how much I paid for it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Innisfree Perfect UV protection triple care cream** – This sunscreen only has physical filters. This just arrived so I haven’t tested it on my face yet. Luckily, I work night shifts and rarely go out during the day so I can avoid the sun for now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Kuramoto Bijin Hakumai Ferment Milk** – I have only seen good reviews on this emulsion and I just truly hope this works for me. To be honest, I really want this not only because of the sake ferments but also because of the sake bottle packaging.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Kuramoto Bijin Lotion** – I read that this is a better sake toner than the Kikumasamune high moist lotion, so I can’t wait to try it.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Kuramoto Bijin Komeyu Rice Bran Oil** – 100% cold pressed rice bran oil from a Japanese brewery. I haven’t used other oils on my face but I read that rice bran oil is an occlusive. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Kuramoto Bijin Komeyu Serum** – I haven’t really tried any other serums but heard good things about this beauty serum. If it will keep my face from getting dry, then I’m all for it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**COSRX Ultimate Nourishing Rice Overnight Spa Mask** – I obviously just want to try more rice beauty products right now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Matsuyama Cleansing Gel** – This is a first cleanser with minimal ingredients and contains soy extract and hydrolyzed soy protein. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Muji seaweed shampoo and conditioner** – Well, since I love Japanese products so much, I might as well try a Japanese sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. I will have to drive 1 hour to get to the nearest Muji, but I will definitely get this. ",

Where seawater used to naturally flow in and out with the tide, that flow has now been cut off—often by road building or the construction of dikes, dams, and other flood- and water-management infrastructure.  \n>  \n>[Recent satellite mapping](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm9583) shows that globally almost 14,000 square kilometers of tidal wetlands disappeared between 1999 and 2009. These losses, however, were offset by the development of nearly 10,000 square kilometers of tidal wetlands over the same period through natural processes and restoration efforts. Estimates suggest that in the United States, up to one-quarter of the coastline is in some state of impoundment, although not all of this area was former wetland.  \n>  \n>Sanders-DeMott and her colleagues’ work shows that this widespread land transformation is bad news for climate change. Comparing two sites around Herring River with two at a nearby natural salt marsh with unrestricted tidal exchange, the researchers measured gas emissions from both types of wetlands. They also used historical sediment core data to analyze how much carbon is stored in the soil and measured other environmental factors, such as the salinity of the water and the type  and density of the vegetation.  \n>  \n>“These impounded wetlands that were freshened and, in our case, invaded by invasive vegetation—which is very common in impounded wetlands—produce a lot more methane than their natural counterparts,” Sanders-DeMott says.  \n>  \n>The scientists found that methane emissions scale exponentially with the salinity of the water. The impounded wetlands were fresher than the undisturbed tidal wetlands, with the freshest impounded site they studied producing almost 50 times more methane than the saltiest  unrestricted wetland.  \n>  \n>That increase in methane is likely caused by changes in the plant and  microbial communities in the wetlands. The microbes that decompose plant matter in saltier environments produce less methane than those in  fresher ecosystems.  \n>  \n>While all wetlands store an impressive amount of carbon, the impounded study sites’ methane emissions are high enough that the wetlands have a net warming effect on the atmosphere, Sanders-DeMott says.\n\n**\\[CORAL\\]** [**Okinawa corals suffer bleaching**](https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/science-nature/environment/20220823-53369/)\n\n>August 23, 2022 - Coral bleaching was recently confirmed off Iriomote and Ishigaki islands in the Yaeyama Islands of Okinawa Prefecture, home to many coral reefs.  \n>  \n>“As no typhoons have approached the area around the islands this year, sea temperatures might have remained high for lack of churn,” said coral ecology expert Takashi Nakamura, an associate professor at the University of the Ryukyus.  \n>  \n>The Environment Ministry and the university plan to conduct a field survey in the area as early as September.\n\n**\\[PLASTIC\\]** [**Tasty fruit and vegetable straws replace plastic**](https://www.phnompenhpost.com/lifestyle-creativity-innovation/tasty-fruit-and-vegetable-straws-replace-plastic)\n\n>August 8, 2022 - Minister of Environment Say Samal praised a Cambodian enterprise that makes straws from rice and vegetable matter rather than plastic, which he said is overused around the world.  \n>  \n>“We did it!

It can interfere with the metabolism of other cations, thus inducing gastrointestinal disorder. In cosmetics, aluminum is used in antiperspirants, lipsticks, and toothpastes. The aim of this work is to investigate aluminum bioavailability after accidental oral ingestion derived from the use of a toothpaste containing a greater amount of aluminum hydroxide than advised by the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS). To simulate in vitro toothpaste accidental ingestion, the INFOGEST model was employed, and the amount of aluminum was measured through the ICP-AES analysis. Tissue barrier integrity was analyzed by measuring transepithelial electric resistance, and the tissue architecture was checked through light microscopy. The margin of safety was also calculated. Overall, our results indicate that the acute exposure to aluminum accidentally ingested from toothpastes is safe for the final user, even in amounts higher than SCCS indications.\n\n**\\[FORMULATION SOFTWARE\\]** [**Expert Systems for Predicting the Bioavailability of Sun Filters in Cosmetic Products, Software vs. Expert Formulator: The Benzophenone-3 Case**](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/14/9/1815/htm)\n\n>August 18, 2022 - There are only a limited number of molecules in a cosmetic formulation, which can passively cross the stratum corneum and be absorbed into the skin layers. However, some actives should never cross the skin in large concentrations due to their potential for side effects, for example, sunscreens. Artificial intelligence is gaining an increasing role as a predictive tool, and in this regard, we selected the Formulating for Efficacy® Software to forecast the changes in bioavailability of selected topical cosmetic compounds. Using the Franz diffusion cell methodology, various oils were selected as those with low release capability, and these were compared to those suggested by the software in Benzophenone-3-containing formulations. The software was able to predict the lipophilic phases, which, if utilized in the emulsion, were stable and sometimes even more pleasant in appearance and consistency than the reference emulsions prepared by the formulator. To date, however, Formulating for Efficacy® Software still has limitations as far as predicting the hydrophilic phase, as well as not being able to choose the emulsifier or the preservative system.  \n\n**\\[SARGASSUM/SEAWEED\\]** [**Potential Beneficial Effects of Sargassum spp. in Skin Aging**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9410049/)**.**\n\n>August 22, 2022 - Seaweeds are receiving much attention as a rich source of bioactive compounds with cosmeceutical potential. Recent studies have revealed  that *Sargassum* spp., a genus of brown algae in the family Sargassaceae, has multiple functions in preventing and improving skin aging. *Sargassum* spp. contains many bioactive compounds, such as fucoidan, fucoxanthin, terpenoids, flavonoids, and meroterpenoids. These *Sargassum* spp. extracts and derivative compounds have excellent potential for skincare, as they exhibit skin health-promoting properties, including  antioxidants, anti-inflammation, whitening, skin barrier repair, and moisturizing. Therefore, searching for bioactive compounds in marine resources such as *Sargassum* spp. could be an attractive approach to preventing and improving skin aging. The current review  focused on the various biological abilities of *Sargassum* extracts or derived compounds for anti-skin aging. \n\n**\\[TiO2 NANOPARTICLES\\]** [**UV protective fabric for face covering utility article using TiO2 nanoparticles**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214785322054347)\n\n>August 26, 2022 - Climate change has drastically raised the requirements for sun protection in recent years. Titanium dioxide [nanoparticles](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/nanoparticle) are shown to be very resistant to ultraviolet light and have a high UV protection factor. The titanium dioxide nanoparticles were used in this work to improve the UV protection of cotton fabric. The application of TiO2 nanoparticles necessitates the employment of a cross-linking agent as well as a catalyst, both of which have negative effects, thus a design of experiment was used to improve the application process. To investigate the use of nano-TiO2 on cotton fabric, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transformation [infrared spectroscopy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/infrared-spectroscopy)  (FTIR) were used. Cotton fabric's UV-protection factor (UPF) and crease recovery characteristics were also assessed. The obtained findings demonstrate strong UV-ray blocking characteristics (UPF 30 + ) as well as good wrinkle recovery in cotton fabric to develop face-covering utility articles.\n\n[A similar study was also conducted in 2020 with similar results](https://ojs.cnr.ncsu.edu/index.php/JTATM/article/download/10242/7814).\n\n**\\[UV Parasol\\]** [**UV Parasol, Dry-Mist Spraying, and Street Trees as Tools for Heat Stress Mitigation**](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jmsj/100/4/100_2022-035/_html/-char/en) \n\n>August 3, 2022 - Ultraviolet (UV) parasols are a reasonable countermeasure against heat stress as they are portable and inexpensive. This study compared the heat stress mitigation effect of a UV parasol with that of street trees and dry-mist spraying on a hot and humid summer day in Japan. We observed meteorological elements and calculated the universal thermal climate index (UTCI) and wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) under UV parasol, street trees, dry-mist spraying, and direct sunlight. The observed UTCI and WBGT under the UV parasol were lower than those in  direct sunlight by 4.4°C and 1.3°C, respectively, because of the decrease in black-globe temperature caused by the reduced downward shortwave radiation. This demonstrated that UV parasol reduced heatstroke risk by one level. The effect of the UV parasol was ≥ 75% of that of the street trees from the perspective of UTCI. The street trees reduced the UTCI and WBGT by 5.9°C and 1.9°C, respectively, compared with those in direct sunlight, resulting in the reduction of heatstroke risk by one level. In contrast, dry-mist spraying did not mitigate heat stress in conditions with moderate winds. Although the results of this study were obtained from observations on a single day, comparison with earlier studies confirms that the values observed in this study are representative results on summer days in Japan. \n\n**\\[UV Protection\\]** [**Flower Extracts from Ornamental Plants as Sources of Sunscreen Ingredients: Determination by In Vitro Methods of Photoprotective Efficacy, Antigenotoxicity and Safety**](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/17/5525/htm)\n\n>August 4, 2022 - Plants are sources of sunscreen ingredients that prevent cellula mutations involved in skin cancer and aging. This study investigated the sunscreen properties of the extracts from some ornamental plant growing in Colombia. The UV filter capability of the flower extracts  obtained from Rosa centifolia L., Posoqueria latifolia (Rudge) Schult, and Ipomoea horsfalliae Hook. was examined. Photoprotection efficacies were evaluated using in vitro indices such as sun protection factor and critical wavelength. UVB antigenotoxicity estimates measured with the SOS Chromotest were also obtained. Extract cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were studied in human  fibroblasts using the trypan blue exclusion and Comet assays respectively. Major compounds of the promising flower extracts were identified by UHPLC–ESI+–Orbitrap–MS. The studied extracts showed high photoprotection efficacy and antigenotoxicity against UVB radiation, but only the P. latifolia extract showed broad-spectrum photoprotection at non-cytotoxic concentrations. The P. latifolia extract appeared to be safer for human fibroblast cells and the R. centifolia extract was shown to be moderately cytotoxic and genotoxic at the highest assayed concentrations. The I. horsfalliae extract was unequivocally cytotoxic and genotoxic. The major constituents of the promising extracts were as follows: chlorogenic acid, ecdysterone 20E, rhamnetin-rutinoside, cis-resveratrol-diglucoside, trans-resveratrol-diglucoside in P. latifolia; quercetin, quercetin-glucoside, quercetin-3-rhamnoside, kaempferol, kaempferol-3-glucoside, and kaempferol-rhamnoside in R. centifolia. The potential of the ornamental plants as sources of sunscreen ingredients was discussed.",

    "body": "I ordered samples from sweet Brim on May 29th, and got them on June 11th. If you’re not already aware, these tiny dropper bottles are pure genius and so damn adorable! I don’t have anything else like them, so bravo for being an innovator! *(Except let’s forget that one time I cut the tops off the droppers like a total dingus…)*\n\nAnyway, I successfully completed the near-impossible task of allowing these li’l babies the 2 weeks rest they needed to hopefully really shine. I am a firm believer that all oil-based perfumes benefit from adequate rest straight out of the mail, and similarly, always smell better when aged for a few months. \n\nBased on my personal experience mixing perfumes, I’m assuming these are pretty newly mixed scents which haven’t benefited from a good couple months’ worth of aging yet, as most of these 1.) didn’t have a ton of longevity on me, and 2.) seemed to morph a lot over the wear-time. This isn’t to demean their quality though, I simply find that freshly mixed scents do seem to have these two characteristics, and tend to “mellow out” and unify with age. Some Indie perfumers plan and mix scents and pre-age them months in advance, and some have so many brilliant ideas they just mix ‘em when they can! It could also be a question of the base that each perfumer is using - these were the rice bran oil samples, and Brim has since switched everything over to fractionated coconut oil, so I know that’s going to lend a huge improvement to their longevity and throw.\n\nThat being said, in general I truly believe everyone should give their perfume collections second and maybe even third chances after months of aging to see if they really truly like or dislike the scent before destashing. By all means, upsize if it’s something you really like, though, because the chances of it getting even better over time have always been super high IMO!\n\nWithout further prattling on about boring technical shit, my personal thoughts on D&F:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **She Plucked Our Hearts Fresh From the Grove and Served Them Up for Supper** *(earthy figs, warm sun-dried tomatoes, lush honeysuckle)*\n\n**Initial application:** Lots and lots of soft honeysuckle. I took a leap on this one, as honeysuckle is one of my death notes, but surprisingly for how much honeysuckle I’m getting, I don’t feel a headache coming on. I was personally hoping for this one to be heavier on the tomatoes - I want to smell like a straight-up, literal sun dried tomato - but it only wafts in here and there, lending a tang to the honeysuckle that’s probably also tempering it from veering into headache territory. On first application there’s the very green stank of tomato leaf, but this dies down quickly, which bums me out, man.\n\n**30 minutes in:** Lightly toasted corn tortilla (???) but I’m not mad about it, with light honeysuckle. Interesting morph!\n\n**Throw:** Minimal \n\n**Color:** Pale yellow\n\n**For people who like:** Soft, floral, light, fuzzy, sunny garden scents; imagining you’re a hummingbird flitting between spring flowers and taking a break by resting on a fat tomato.\n\n**Verdict:** 4.5/5 A really lovely blend, but too much honeysuckle for me personally. Smells STUPID GOOD on others though!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A Living Warmth, and a Picture of Death** *(peppery flowers and herbs, hay and old roses, musky cloves, a sharp glint of metal and worn leather)*\n\n**Initial application:** Sweet, floral, leathery/vanillic, peppery, warm with a strange tartness or piquancy, sort of dusty, the tang of metal, almost synthetic smelling but with like a warm sort of background to it.\n\n**30 minutes in:** OH NO! How has it gone soapy?? Soapy warmth with a hint of spice. I’m bummed.\n\n**Throw:** Moderate\n\n**Color:** Taupe & olive green\n\n**For people who like:** Warm atmospherics; being caught off guard by a unique scent; hoarded collections of antique dusty silverware in an old sun-warmed hay barn.\n\n**Verdict:** 1.5/5 Not a fan of this one, folks, but I would have been if it hadn’t gone all soapy on me. I think I’ll keep it around just to see how it ages/if it loses that quality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dusty Stacks of Vinyl Records on an Antique Store Floor** *(Arabian sandalwood, dusty aged paper, cedar, warm stagnant air, patchouli, vetiver, amryris, musk)*\n\n**Initial application:** Dank, dusty, warm and super interesting! This one has some qualities I can’t quite place… but I definitely get the feeling of the warm stagnant air from it. Everything works so well together that I honestly can’t pick out individual notes here. And it’s not so much vinyl records as it is dusty books for me!\n\n**30 minutes in:** Similar to A Living Warmth but without the metal tang and florals. The vinyl is coming out a bit more now! As far as longevity goes, it fades quite quickly.\n\n**Throw:** Minimal\n\n**Color:** Light brown\n\n**For people who like:** Creaky old bookstores; warm atmospherics; making people wonder if you’re some kind of spectral librarian.\n\n**Verdict:** 2.5/5 So interesting, I think it’s worth a try if it’s on your radar. However, it’s not something I’d ever find myself reaching for, so I will likely destash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **The Wolf Only Needs Luck to Find You Once** *(crisp forest night air, lunar musk, large drifting oakwood trees, the musky scent of a trailing shadow)*\n\n**Initial application:** Extremely soft, more like a skin scent. I feel like I’m completely anosmic to this. All I get is a super faint muskiness, a little “freshness”, and not much else. This is a head scratcher, as I’ve never before been nose-blind to any of the hundreds of scents I’ve tried. It was a gracious freebie - not something I would have picked for myself - so take this particular review with a grain of salt.\n\n**30 minutes in:** Nope, still nothin'. Husband says it smells like a dentist’s office, and bestie confirms this. Welp.\n\n**Throw:** Minimal\n\n**Color:** Translucent? lol\n\n**For people who like:** The scent of nothingness; roleplaying the sadomasochistic dentistry scenario from Little Shop of Horrors, apparently…\n\n**Verdict:** 0/5 Hoooo doggie, we're headed for destash central.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **The Secret of Wives and Widows** *(Arabian sandalwood, luscious vanilla, orchids, southern night air, white tea in a fine cup of china)*\n\n**Initial application:** Very soft and light; I’m getting the tea right away mixed with deliciously cozy sandalwood. I can smell the “green” of the tea leaves, but only for a little while. The vanilla is not at all foody, it’s more of a dry ethereal vanilla. It has a “powdery” quality and feel without being off-putting or baby-like.\n\n**30 minutes in:** The vanilla and sandalwood are becoming more sugary now, and the tea is taking a back seat. I’m getting “leftover sugar that’s settled at the bottom of my tea cup” and I am LIVING for it. This one is a full on tea party experience from top to bottom and I’m thoroughly impressed! Longevity is also super high compared to the other D&F scents I’ve reviewed thus far.\n\n**Throw:** Minimal to Moderate\n\n**Color:** Bone white\n\n**For people who like:** Lacy, light, soft, dainty scents; fancy southern tea parties with huge hats and frilly dresses; inoffensive workplace-friendly type scents.\n\n**Verdict:** 4/5 This is pure loveliness, I’ll probably be wearing this a ton in late winter/early spring.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Before You Were Dust** *(herbal bay leaves, black tea, sweet tobacco, the smell of a deep belly laugh, an old wooden cane, a worn out hat, a leather jacket)*\n\n**Initial application:** Sourrrrrr and so tangy right off the bat! But then it mellows out to a more woody tobacco scent. Very syrupy - this one’s a thicc boi. The wood, leather, and tobacco are fighting for prominence here, and tobacco is coming out on top. I’m sure all the other reviews said they didn’t know what the smell of a deep belly laugh is, but I do! \n\nJK I have no fuckin’ clue.\n\n**30 minutes in:** I’m getting a spice/herbal quality which seems like it’s from the bay leaves but also it smells like expensive antique wood furniture. This is a warm, cozy, spicy, adventurous scent and I’m so glad it’s moved away from its syrupy start. I want to bury my face in it.\n\n**Throw:** Moderate to Strong\n\n**Color:** Molasses brown & dark burgundy\n\n**For people who like:** Cigar bars filled with fascinating people who have equally entertaining stories to tell; falling in love with a suave art thief wearing a worn leather jacket; a potent, head-turning, woody, syrupy, spicy scent.\n\n**Verdict:** 4/5 Giving this to my own thicc boi so he can smell like the most interesting man in the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **The Soft Crunch of Bread and Bone** *(flaky coconut French madeleines, bakery air, vanilla cremé, crunchy macarons, the last sip of green tea)*\n\n**Initial application:** Strangely, the bakery air is the strongest note right away, as it smells more truly like the inside of a bakery than the baked goods themselves. This is such a unique blend, I’ve honestly never smelled anything like it. I don’t get much in the way of individual notes, more like wafts of vaguely vanilla pastry, a strange cotton-y note, and green tea that resembles a cannabis note. It’s sweet but not overly so, bakery but not overly so… I’ve been sitting here literally scratching my head trying to pin down how to describe it.\n\n**30 minutes in:** There’s a weird hint of ‘sterility’ to it, which makes me wish it were a little more bakery shop that’s just opened and is filled with tons of varying fresh baked pastries, and less like a bakery shop that’s been cleaned out, scrubbed down, and closed for the night. Could that clean, sterile scent be the “bone” part of ‘Bread and Bone’? \n\n**Throw:** Minimal to Moderate\n\n**Color:** Palest sage green\n\n**For people who like:** The nostalgia of opening a bakery in the wee hours of the morning (if you’ve ever had a job at a bakery); clean, vaguely sweet, completely one of a kind scents; dipping their toes into gourmand scents but being too hesitant to dive right in.\n\n**Verdict:** 2/5 As a true gourmand lover, not gonna lie, this one was the one I had highest hopes for, but was most disappointing to me. However, if you’re into more conceptual scents and want to smell like just a faint hint of baked goods - this one is for you!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **The Sweater We Buried You With is Hanging in My Closet** *(three different vanillas, resinous ambers, Arabian sandalwood, a soft cashmere sweater)*\n\n**Initial application:** COZY OMG, with a twinge of tartness from the amber resin. The absolute embodiment of a clean, comfy, warm sweater. It’s vanillic but not foody, and soft, soft, soft without being faint. I can see this being a great layering perfume in the fall and winter to mellow out some spicy pumpkin or dark fruit perfumes. \n\n**30 minutes in:** I keep catching whiffs of myself like “WHO smells so damn sophisticated and unstoppable yet friendly and nurturing!?” Y’all. Why are you even still reading this just go buy this one right freaking now and I promise you won’t be sorry. It’s complex, it’s lasting, it makes an impression, I’m getting very stream of consciousness on you ‘cause I don’t have enough good things to say about Sweater.\n\n**Throw:** Moderate to Strong\n\n**Color:** Creamyyyyyyyyyyyyyy ivory\n\n**For people who like:** Warm, woody, non-gourmand vanillas; cuddling up in a blanket by the fire; smelling like the most perfect hug.\n\n**Verdict:** 5/5 FULL SIZE THIS DON’T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **We Stopped For Coffee in the Red-Wood Forest** *(roasted Colombian coffee beans, red-wood trees, damp forest, black cardamom attar, cinnamon)*\n\n**Initial application:** Y’all. I’m the coffee lady. When I first found IMAM all I wanted was every single coffee perfume rec. My all time favorite will always be coffee. I thrive on it. So I feel like I know what I’m talking about here. This one is a dark, true, black coffee reminiscent of the kind I had in New Orleans, but with a fruitiness to it. This is not a milky latte or even a sweetened coffee, but rather a deep, roasty, woody blend with oaty, fruity nuances. Not getting much spice from either the cardamom or the cinnamon, but they are probably serving to enhance the woodiness. \n\n**30 minutes in:** The fruit nuances are turning kind of cereal-esque, and the coffee is waning (boo!) but it’s honestly still working for me! Cinnamon is peeking out from behind a huge tree. Another super unique blend from Brim, I’ve never smelled anything like this one. Let me just lament - I am DEVASTATED it’s being discontinued.\n\n**Throw:** Moderate\n\n**Color:** Burnt sienna\n\n**For people who like:** Nostalgic walks along the French Quarter, sipping coffee sprinkled with chicory spice and eating powdery beignets; feeling sophisticated as fuck while eating cereal; chewy, gourmand but not sweet blends.\n\n**Verdict:** 4.5/5 BRB snatching this up before it leaves my life forever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **The Blues are All the Same** *(smooth vanilla cognac, aged barrel wood, sticky honey)*\n\n**Initial application:** If you didn't know, I am also the honey lady. Honey and coffee are my big two, give me anything with those and I’m a happy camper. So as a connoisseur, I can say this is soft and sweet and PERFECT honey, a tiny bit powdery but in the richest, most gourmand way, if that makes any sense whatsoever, lol. It’s not very boozy or super vanillic, but has a caramel-like butteriness to it that makes it so mouthwatering. It heavily reminds me of **Arcana - Snug**, one of my all time favorites, but deeper, warmer, and wayyyyyy sexier!!! Cozy and quite irresistible. I bet if I layered this with Sweater, I’d be in pure heaven.\n\n**30 minutes in:** Almost no morph on this one, just pure delicious sweet warm rich golden honey. It’s perfection, and I mean it.\n\n**Throw:** Moderate to Strong\n\n**Color:** Golden amber\n\n**For people who like:** MOTHERFUCKING DELICIOUS HONEY!!!!; sticky-sweet yet warm and comfy gourmands; smelling like the sexiest beekeeper after a long day’s work of collecting honey, ready to sit down and have a nice drink and watch the sun set.\n\n**Verdict:** 6/5!!! Full size, fo’ sho’. I want bathtubs full of this. I can see Blues being a new favorite and a constant in my rotation. The total package. A signature scent. I’m head over heels in LOVE!!!\n\n**Final Verdict on D&F:**\n\nBrim is relatively new to the scene, but she’s already more than proven she’s the sweetheart of IMAM. Her blends are genius, masterfully crafted and extremely unique. Her top notch customer service puts her above and beyond any other indie house I’ve tried (and bitch, I’ve tried A LOT), so even if her blends don’t work for you, you’re going to fall in love with her, her aesthetic, her kindness, and her generosity. (Can you believe I didn’t get asked to say this and I’m not getting paid for this???) \n\nIt’s been said a million times but - take all my money, D&F. Part 2 coming soon (whether you liked this or not)!",

Finely dice 1/3 (work to your tastes) of a red onion, mince a clove of garlic, and crumble some feta in there. Salt it, lemon juice it, oil it (4 tablespoons-ish of that, I used rice bran oil and it was awesome).

To cook quinoa: Rinse quinoa with cold water in mesh strainer. In a medium saucepan, bring 1 ½ cups of water to a boil. Add in quinoa and bring mixture to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low and let simmer for 15 minutes or until quinoa has absorbed all of the water. Remove from heat and fluff quinoa with fork; place in large bowl and set aside to cool for about 10 minutes. You should have a little over 2 cups of quinoa.\n2. To make dressing: Add peanut butter and honey or agave to a medium microwave safe bowl; heat in microwave for 20 seconds. Add in ginger, soy sauce, vinegar, and both sesame and olive oil and stir until mixture is smooth and creamy. If you want a thinner dressing, simply stir in a teaspoon or two of water or olive oil.\n3. Add as much or as little dressing as you’d like to the quinoa. I always start out with a little bit of dressing and usually add more to suit my taste preferences. Alternatively you can save the dressing for later and add when you are ready to eat; however the flavors of the dressing usually soak into the salad so I love adding it to the quinoa first.\n4. Next fold in red pepper, onion, cabbage, carrots, and cilantro into the quinoa. Garnish with cashews and green onions. Serve chilled or at room temperature with lime wedges if desired.\n\n*Edited to fix formatting.",

    "body": "This is what will be the last in my series of D&D diet and agricultural habits for now (until and unless inspiration strikes again!).  Today we are discussing **TORTLES**.  A quick note – a small bit of flavor/lore addition for this article – while my Tortles still venture forth after a year, they stay close to their homelands until age 3 and keep some contact with their home village during this time – this allows for a bit more purpose and continuity to Tortle villages, while keeping a core part of their life philosophy intact.\n\n## Tortle Agriculture and Diet\n\nMost people know Tortles as individual travelers, roaming about exploring the world.  However, there exist stable Tortle communities – just not of the kind most other races would recognize.  Tortles return home to mate at the end of their lives.  They spend at most 2 or 3 years living in communities together with other old Tortles.  While the population of these villages is frequently changing, due to the short remaining life of mating Tortles, the actual infrastructure of the village is fairly stable, and passed on to each succeeding year of returnees.   \n\nYoung Tortles spend their first year in the protection of their village, learning about their history and culture until they are ready to venture forth.  After a year, Tortles spend their next two years in the swamplands of their birth, exploring the local area, and learning how to protect themselves from the dangers of the world.  During this time, young Tortles will frequently visit their village, gaining wisdom from the elders, resting or healing when needed, and gaining supplies. At around three years old, most Tortles leave the swamps and begin their life-long exploration of the world.   \n\n### Farming in the Swamps\n\nTortle reside in forested freshwater swamp lands.  Their land is notable for slow moving streams, stagnant pools, tall grasses in shallow areas, large trees with lush drooping branches and abundant vines, and interspersed bits of water-soaked land.  While most other races would abandon any hope of farming in such conditions, Tortle thrive in the environment.   \n\nTortle grow most of their crops on the water.  They weave together rafts made up of root and branch material that is very densely interwoven.  The plants push through their roots down through the small gaps into the nutrient rich waters of the swamp.  Crops that propagate with runners or ground vines are preferred as they expand naturally.  However nearly any type of crop works, and when needed, Tortles nurture seedlings in pots on land then transfer them to the floating mats when they are ready.  Tortles prefer fibrous leafy vegetables, hard chewy root vegetables and crunchy nuts.  Harder fruits like apples, pears and some melons are also enjoyed.  In shallow parts of the swamp with very light current, Tortles will often plant rice, which is a staple food for them.   \n\nGiant bamboo grows on many of the small islands in the swamp.  The Tortle make a lot of use of the bamboo, consuming the shoots in the spring, and the leaves and stalks of mature plants.  They particularly like hacking off a hunk of stalk and chewing on it for a couple of hours, between meals.  Bamboo is also the primary building material for Tortle houses.\n\nBut Tortles are by no means vegetarian.  They desire a diet that includes a bit of meat from time to time.  Snakes are an important part of the diet, and Tortle will aggressively hunt poisonous snakes if they become a problem near their villages.  Crocodile abound in the Tortle swamps, and there are several species ranging from very small to dangerously big.   While Tortles understand that Crocodile are an important part of the ecosystem, they will manage their numbers down when needed to protect the Tortle village and keep the Crocodiles from impacting the other native aquatic species.\n\n### Typical Meals\n\nTortle are much more interested in the texture of food than of its taste.  A tasty morsel that is soft or soggy would be rejected over a plain, crunchy or chewy bite.  As such, much of the Tortle diet is raw.  Even the rice is typically uncooked.  The Tortle digestive system is quite adept at digesting many plants that other species would find indigestible at best, or poisonous at worst.  As such, a typical dinner would be a spread of various raw vegetables, leaves and roots, laid out to graze on in a leisurely manner – often over several hours.   \n\nWhen meat is added to a meal, it is typically cooked over an open fire to get crispy (roasting meat or putting it in a stew eliminates the desired texture of charred meat).  \n\nSome rice is used to make rice bran oil, which the Tortles use to fry foods.  Battered in rice flour, nearly any Tortle food can be made better (crunchier!) by frying.  But they never over-fry – the goal is to get a crispy outside, while keeping the inside raw and crunchy, and only a bit warmed up.   For example, thickly sliced turnips are fried up and then coated with a bit of sticky honey and rolled in nuts for the ultimate crunchy breakfast.   \n\nPrevious Entries:\n\nDWARVES:  \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/s2eyge/dwarven\\_agriculture/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/s2eyge/dwarven_agriculture/)\n\nELVES: \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/s6b900/elven\\_agriculture\\_and\\_diet/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/s6b900/elven_agriculture_and_diet/)\n\nKOBOLDS:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/sbmhwp/kobold\\_diet\\_and\\_fine\\_cuisine/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/sbmhwp/kobold_diet_and_fine_cuisine/)\n\nGOLIATHS:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/sgeyhj/goliath\\_diet\\_and\\_agriculture/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/sgeyhj/goliath_diet_and_agriculture/)",

I live close to my work, and in the summer I wanted to start walking home every day to enjoy the weather but, of course, I didn't want to catch fire in the process. I had been to Japan on a couple of occasions, my co-worker had talked to me about [snails](https://media.giphy.com/media/MBzMzNna9VDUc/giphy.gif), but aside from that I knew less than nothing about Asian skincare. \n\nSo, I did what any young lady with a head full of brains would do in my case, [I Googled it.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/20/33/01/203301fbebef2b8273b35a00e7e1a859.jpg)\n\nAnd I honestly didn't do too badly! I found Innisfree's website and started looking around at the products they had, then I looked up Korean skincare on Reddit, and hit on [this place.](https://secure.static.tumblr.com/98e2ee58a9c82b0c4a115cd9f035f9be/vxnkqmk/jgXnnvgky/tumblr_static_filename_640_v2.jpg)\n\nI started reading, researching and learning the terms. About 3 weeks into it, I felt I knew what my skin type was (Combination Oily/Dry/Sensitive) and what I wanted to address (the outbreak of acne on the sides of my nose, triggered by my nose being itchy because it was dry and I kept rubbing it... ), so I selected my products (lots of Innisfree Green Tea Fresh line, sheet masks, and sunscreen!) and placed [my order.](https://www.facebook.com/tlskrdl/videos/740821496047378/?pnref=story)\n\nAnd you know what? Not everything worked. Some of the first things I'd hand picked after all my learnings caused breakouts. Or dry patches. Or cranky skin. \n\nI learned to put it down. I used just my cleanser, and just a toner and serum and I'd give my skin a break. When it was looking better, I'd start again. I tested, and re-tested, and stopped using certain things altogether. It wasn't perfect. My skin still wouldn't be happy from time to time.\n\nSometimes it would take minutes for a reaction. Yes, really. \n\nSometimes it took days. \n\nTwice it took a couple of weeks. O_O\n\nBut I kept reading, and googling, and checking up on products, and what other people with my skin type were using, and how they were faring and what their sensitivities were.\n\nI even eventually discovered that I was wrong about my skin type as Combination/Sensitive. I began to lean more towards possibly having Dehydrated/Sensitive skin, and hopefully when my next order arrives I'll be able to confirm my self-diagnosis.\n\n**PSA**: A year later and I do still struggle sometimes. I'm working toward an overhaul of my routine, I'm destashing and re-purposing some products. And I'm still learning as I go. It has been worth it though, and I hope that anyone who reads this and is maybe considering the switch from western to asian skincare learns from my mistakes, or at least keeps them in mind. :3\n\nNow, onto the reviews! While I do want to talk about EVERYTHING, I probably shouldn't. So, I'm going to do a run through mostly of what I currently use, what it does, and why I'm restocking or not restocking. I will also have some words to say about the stuff that I'm NOT restocking (ever), because every good review deserves a bit of balance so I don't sound gushy. I HAVE had issues with products, and it's important for skin twins and lurkers to know why it didn't work for me. We should all keep an eye out for each other when it comes to preventing reactions and increasing understanding. Right? Right!\n\n**Currently In Use:**\n\n* Innisfree Calming Gel Cleanser (Discontinued) - Only used once a day, otherwise my skin gets over cleansed and sad. The rest of the time, it's happy and I am going to miss this cleanser like CRAZY. Trying to find a replacement has been the worst thing ever. ;_;\n\n* Innisfree Minimum Toner - I use this twice a day, it does contain Madecassoside which is good for cell turnover. I'll pair this with the Jeju-Bija Anti Trouble Toner if I'm having a breakout.\n\n* Innisfree Jeju Bija Anti-trouble Toner - Fantastic when I get a reaction and whiteheads start appearing. My skin isn't really oily enough to use it on a daily basis though.\n\n* Innisfree Green Tea Seed Serum - Another \"good when I have a reaction\" item. Since I suspect my skin is dehydrated, not combination, I don't find it does much in the way of keeping my skin moist unless I spritz with bottled water first. Minimizes whiteheads and irritation though, so it is a keeper \"just in case\". Not gonna lie, it's also the [smell!](http://i.makeagif.com/media/5-25-2014/nfFqQz.gif)\n\n* Innisfree Minimum Ampoule Essence - My evening Essence, but it doesn't have any actives or really hydrate my skin. I may not purchase this again, which is a huge loss because of the [smell!](http://i.makeagif.com/media/5-25-2014/nfFqQz.gif)\n\n* Innisfree Green Tea Fresh Essence - Interesting jelly-like texture when you pump it out of the bottle. If I had to give up my Green Tea Seed Serum for good, I'd use this as the next layer. I probably won't purchase this again, though as it seems a bit redundant.\n\n* Innisfree Green Tea Fresh Cream - I love the clarity, love the scent, love the fact that it slowly sinks into my skin and makes it feel fresh. But it;s not intended for dehydrated skin and it doesn't really lock moisture in. I have one more jar coming, and once I'm through it I'll be looking at other gels with more hydration.\n\n* Innisfree Green Tea Sleeping Pack - Not a perfect occlusive layer because it can take forever to sink into your skin. Once I woke up coated in cat fur after using it in the summer. However, I've used this during the day as a lotion in the winter because of how dry it gets indoors and found I liked it better. I would repurchase again for sure as a winter cream. \n\n* Innisfree It's Real Sheet Masks in Rose, Bamboo, Aloe and Cucumber - Basic sheet masks, now that I've tried others. Nothing wrong with them, but nothing overly special either. Sometimes a girl just needs a basic, soothing sheet mask. Be aware that they DO contain alcohol as the 4th ingredient and if you DO choose to use them on sensitive or dehydrated skin, you might want to take them off after 10 minutes or so of use. Will not repurchase as the money can be put towards something better.\n\n* Innisfree Skin Clinic Masks in BHA, Vitamin C and Collagen - I do like this line better, although the amount of actives in each mask is unknown. That being said, if you'd like to try Vitamin C or BHA and you're not even sure it will work for you, these sheet masks are a good way to dip your toe into the world of actives. The fit is quite nice, and the sheets are soft and thin. I can leave these on for much longer than the previous masks, since they have no alcohol in them. \n\n* Innisfree Capsule Packs in Seaweed, Green Tea, and Volcanic Cluster - The Seaweed is easily my favorite. It's mildly exfoliating, and I love the [smell](http://i.makeagif.com/media/5-25-2014/nfFqQz.gif) and the warming effect when it goes on your face. Green Tea wasn't bad, I tried it only once and then had a mild reaction afterwards. I was also in the middle of testing a new cleanser too, my bad. I'll have to give it a shot again later. The Volcanic Cluster is like the foaming wash without the soapy effect. Good for drying up excess oil, so on my face it wasn't the greatest thing, but at least it made it feel soft when I washed it off. Seaweed is a repurcahse. I need to give Green Tea another shot, and the Volcanic Clyster is a nay.\n\n* Creer Beaute Sailor Moon Miracle Romance Masks - Bought them on a whim. Lovely rose scent, but otherwise nothing to get excited about. They ARE hydrating though, and no alcohol. I'll finish the box, but I don't think I need to repurchase ($25 for 5. No. Fricking. Way.)\n\n* Skinfood Rose and Shea Butter Hand Cream SPF 25 PA++ - I mostly use this at work, I LOOOOOOVE the rose [smell!](http://i.makeagif.com/media/5-25-2014/nfFqQz.gif) I notice if I use too much, most of it wipes off on the files and my desk. One bottle lasts for quite some time because I use it sparingly now. I'll repurchase only because it's easier to keep at my desk without everyone in the office using it up on me. :(\n\n* Skinfood Marshmallow and Honey Hand Cream Snoopy Limited Edition - Guilty Pleasure! Another one with a great smell, and the texture is like marshmallows when you squeeze it out. Combine that with the honey and it's hard to not lick it off your fingers when you are done rubbing it in. I bought one extra for my boyfriend to use at work because his hands get very rough and dry as well. This sinks in and he loves it. TesterKorea brought in a few more bottles, and I ordered three more last month. Gonna miss it when it's gone though.\n\n* A'pieu Peach and Shea Butter Hand Lotion - This is my day to day lotion. The fresh peach smell is awesome, and the shea butter keeps everything soft. I like using it after a bath on my dry legs and elbows. Definite repurchase.\n\n* Berrisom Sheep Sheet Mask Vitamin C and Arbutin/Cat Sheet Mask with Collagen - I've only tried it once and it made a decent enough impression that I'd like to try more of this line. I'll pick some more up in Japan this year before I make a final decision.\n\n\n\n**Benched:**  *(Full size product, this list reminds me why decants, samples, and patch testing are a thing!)*\n\n* Innisfree Jeju Bija Anti-Trouble Cleansing Gel - I tried this twice. Once as the first cleanser, then as the second. It worked better as a first cleanser, but I can't do it two days in a row. I think it's just too stripping for my skin. Nice scent though, if it were a body wash, I'd use it.\n\n* Innisfree Eco Safety Aqua Perfect Sun Gel - This is the \"within minutes\" reaction I talked about. I was excited to have it with me during my last tip to Japan, and I thought the acne I was getting was because of the sweat and oil built up under the sunscreen itself. Took me until March of this year to realize it was the alcohol and the triethanolamine in it that was making my skin react. Sorry, Innisfree. You dropped the ball on this one.\n\n* Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Gel - Biore, you were supposed to be the one! The prophecy foretold you! I paid $20 for the bottle!! The alcohol burn wasn't worth it though, and it took a week of all-day sleeping packs and ampoules twice daily to get my skin back to \"not awful\". Sorry, Biore.\n\n* Innisfree Minimum Foaming Cleanser - It had less ingredients than my Calming Gel Cleanser, reviewed well, and was inexpensive too boot. After a week my skin felt like it had a net stretched over it when it was wet. Holes and more holes. A very strange way to tell me no, but I heeded my skin's advice. \n\n* Innisfree Jeju Bija Trouble Spot Essence W - The only anti-acne product I've had give me more acne. It was a purchase from Japan and the product wasn't even available on the website anymore when I looked it up to find the ingredients. Tossed it after one use.\n\n* Innisfree Jeju Bija Anti Trouble Lotion - Too thick for my skin. Another anti-acne product that causes irritation, but that has more to do with the fact that it's in a lotion base and my skin doesn't like lotions. :<\n\n* Innisfree Apple Juicy Cleansing Oil - I tried, and tried again. I don't mind the smell, it has good slip and it feels nourishing. BUT. My skin reacted! Why? WHY! I don't know why. My first foray into oil cleansing, and it didn't go unpunished. :(\n\n* Holika Holika 92% Aloe Shower Gel - This is the \"weeks\" reaction. I bought it in Japan, loved the smell, and brought a couple bottles back to Canada. I was down to my last bottle, had just ordered two more from Tester Korea, and I noticed the dry patch on the inside of my arm that was itchy. All. The. Time. Then came the cracked and sore dry patches on the backs of my hands. :| .... at least my boyfriend likes it, because it's ALL his now. FYI - This contains Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate. :/\n\n\n\n**Tested:**  *(The following were samples or one time buys.)*\n\n* Innisfree Jeju Volcanic Pore Cleansing Foam - Nice foaming cleanser, but my skin can't handle it more than maybe once every two weeks.\n\n* Innisfree It's Real Rice Sheet Mask - The essence had a nice light scent, but it was thicker and creamier than a regular essence. It also irritated my skin just a bit, probably because of the alcohol.\n\n* Innisfree Skin Clinic Hyaluronic Acid Sheet Mask - Hyaluronic Acid has a specific job, and I didn't see it in my skin. Thankfully, it was a gift with purchase.\n\n* Innisfree Berry Hydrogel Mask - Nice and luxe, but irritated my skin ever so slightly. Maybe when my moisture barrier is up and protecting again, I'll give hydrogels another try.\n\n* Tatcha Camellia Cleansing Oil - A sample from Sephora, not bad. This is what got me thinking that maybe I COULD oil cleanse somehow, but not for the cost. The inclusion of Rice Bran Oil has me thinking I could try that on its own and see where things go.\n\n* Derma Dr.Lab Hydromoist Balancing Cream - Love the scent, but it leaves a slightly waxy cast on my skin as the day goes on. It also keeps my skin hydrated well, but this is probably more suited for someone with dry skin. \n\n* Missha Super Aqua Ultra Waterfull Cream - Oh god the smell. I hated testing this because of the smell and it's a shame because it succeeded in ways the Derma Dr.Lab failed. Sorry Missha. Maybe the gel cream version will play nicely.\n\n* Boscia Tsubaki Cleansing Oil Gel - Not bad, and I was getting excited until I found Innisfree's Broccoli Gel Cleanser was only $5 for the tube. Sorry Boscia. I'll give the cheaper alternative a shot first if it means it will work just as well without breaking the bank.\n\n* The Saem G-Dragon Eco-Energy Gel Mask Sheet [Moist-Bright] - I liked it! Tested it twice in Japan and my skin seemed happy. Got back to Canada with 5 more of them, and by mask #2, my skin revolted. Now they're expired, but I keep them around just to look at [GD's pretty face.](https://media0.giphy.com/media/KBzHGfLb6WpBS/200.gif)\n\n\n\n**New Arrivals:**\n\n* Canmake Mermaid Skin Gel UV SPF 50+ PA++++ (Testing phase - I am SO EXCITED about this sunscreen, you guys!!!!)\n\n* Sunkiller Perfect Strong Moisture SPF 50+ PA++++ (Unopened)\n\n* Innisfree Jeju Lava Seawater Skin (In Transit)\n\n* Innisfree Jeju Lava Seawater Essence (In Transit)\n\n* Innisfree Broccoli Clearing Gel Cleanser (In Transit)\n\n* Innisfree Soybean Energy Essence Light (In Transit)\n\n* Skinfood Peach Sake Silky Finish Powder (In Transit)\n\n* Mediental Snail Collagen Aquaring Gel (Purchased at Winners, Unopened)\n\n\n\n**Wishlist:**  *(Hoping to purchase these items in Japan this year, if anyone has any reviews, I'd be happy to read them!)*\n\n* Kuramoto Bijin Hakumai Ferment Milk\n\n* Kuramoto Bijin Komeyu Oil\n\n* Dr Ci Labo Aqua Collagen Gel\n\n* Mizu No Tenshi Gel\n\n* Moonflash Cushion\n\nThat's it!

    "body": "**MPB isn't a singular event but a culmination of several contributing factors**\n\n1. **Chronic Inflammation and Stress in the body:**\n\n**Cause:** **Stress depletes magnesium**, a vital mineral which increases Nitric oxide for ***blood vessel*** relaxation and nutrient delivery to follicles. Additionally, stress blocks vitamin D3 receptors and GAS6 protein, both crucial for hair growth. Mg also blocks calcium ion channels. Increased calcium ion channels causes death of hair follicle (palmitic acid, oxidative stress, and genetics)\n\n**Cures:**\n\na. Magnesium-rich foods\n\nb. sunshine exposure\n\nc. stress-management techniques like yoga or meditation,\n\nd. Vitamin D3 supplements\n\ne. Anu taila through nose\n\nf. Topical Rice bran oil (RBO) increases NO secretion\n\ng. Ashwagandha Oral reduces cortisol\n\nh. Sulphur in MSM etc enhances blood flow\n\ni. β-sitosterol\n\nj.\n\n**2.** **3α-HSD Deficiency:**\n\n**Cause:**  This enzyme converts the DHT hormone into a beneficial byproduct called androstanol. Zinc and B6 deficiencies involved in the biosynthesis and activity of 3α-HSD. Obesity, metabolic syndrome and severe infections can cause a systemic inflammatory response, all of which lead to **3α-HSD Deficiency. Depletion of type 1 3α-HSD in the liver can lead to cortisol resistance (which ultimately impacts hair as well), while depletion of type 5 3α-HSD in the skin can cause steroid hormone imbalances and affect hair growth.**\n\n**Cure:**\n\n1. zinc, B6, procyanidin B2 and sulforaphane to boost 3α-HSD activity.\n2. Topical Procyanidin B-2 1% has growth-promoting effects on hair epithelial cells that follow MEK activation and their protective action on TGF-beta(1)- or TGF-beta(2)-induced apoptosis that is assumed to trigger catagen induction in the hair cycle\n3. Procyanidin B-2 Ignite Keratin production in hair follicles by inhibiting the pentose phosphate pathway and amino acid oxidation\n4. **Energy Mismanagement:**\n\n**Cause:** Hair growth is a hungry beast, and calorie restriction puts it on a starvation diet. Prioritize **protein intake for healthy follicles**, remember that hair is not essential for survival, so it gets the leftovers during stress. **Any type of stress first effects hair, nails and skin**\n\n**Cure:** Ensure decent protein intake. Protein is needed for iodination reaction of thyroid gland. Iodine and thyroxine combine to form thyroid hormones. If iodine/protein deficiency is there it will lead to hair fall.\n\n4. **Vitamin D3 Receptor Blockade:**\n\n**Cause:** 4. Vitamin D receptors are located on every cell of body. If you do not have enough Vitamin D receptors you will lose hair. These vital receptors are like locks, and if blocked by obesity, medications, or high cortisol, hair growth stalls.\n\nD3 is important for differentiation and initiation of anagen phase of hair cycle. VDR is a key component that influences hair follicle health and growth. Activated VDR leads to thicker, faster-growing hair. Calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, activates VDR.A lowered capacity for vitamin D activation could lead to less circulating calcitriol and lower VDR activation. This theory connects low magnesium levels, responsible for efficient calcitriol activation, to hair loss.\n\n**Cures:**\n\n1. Sunshine\n2. Liver health is very important. Liver secretes Bile, bile is important to stimulate vitamin D receptors. Eat sulphur rich food (like MSM) and taurine to make liver healthy\n3. If vitamin D3 is not correcting your D3 levels, you need B12, Magnesium, Boron, Quercetin, flavonoids, Gamma tocopherol (sub unit of vitamin E), Curcumin and Ginger, Green tea, intensive exercise\n4. **Leaky Gut, Gut Microbiome, and Sebum Overload:**\n\n**Cause:** Sebum acts as hydrolipid layer (waterproofing), and prevents loss of nutrients, natural oils, and protects against pollutants. A leaky gut allows toxins to infiltrate the bloodstream, leading to *altered host response*, and triggering sebaceous gland overproduction. This excess sebum clogs follicles, suffocating hair growth, prevents nutrients from reaching hair follicle andcCuts oxygen supply to hair follicle. It’s also called epidermal plaque. Gut is connected to liver via portal vein, and so an unhealthy gut also implies an unhealthy liver. If liver is unhealthy, chances of metabolic syndrome is high. It is seen that people with metabolic syndrome have extreme active sebaceous glands. High Sebum is also correlated with high DHT. Elevated Propionibacterium acnes (p. acnes) has been seen in bald scalp areas, which is also linked to gut issues.\n\n*Anecdotes on Faecal Matter Transplant (FMT) curing MPB, you can’t have a double blind placebo controlled study on this one*\n\n**Cures:**\n\n1. Heal the gut with stress reduction,\n2. Remove gluten and dairy,\n3. Embrace fermented foods.\n4. Topically, use Topical Ketoconzole + zinc shampoos and apple cider vinegar to dissolve sebum.\n5. Probiotics and Prebiotics\n6. Oral Shatavari Root contains quercetin, naringenin, and p-coumaric acid, and reduces steroid 5-alpha reductase gene (SRD5A) expression and lowers sebum production.\n7. Frankincense oral reduces bacteria / fungi and inflammation\n8. Vitamin K2\n9. Nattokinase , kimchi\n10. &#x200B;\n11. **Fibrosis and Calcification of Arteries:**\n\n**Cause:**  Perifollicular fibrosis (or scar tissue) OR excessive cross-linkage of collagen leads to **tight scalp**, and calcium deposits restrict blood flow, both hindering hair growth. Fibrosis is caused by Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEP), which is causes by insulin insensitivity. Zinc deficiency can lead to increased leucine and hydroxyl l-leucine, which are part of amino acid lysine which takes part in collagen formation. Increased leucine and hydroxyl l-leucine can lead to fibrosis\n\n**Cures:**\n\na. Combat with micro-needling (also increases SULT1 sulfotransferase which is a stimulant), improved insulin sensitivity through diet and exercise\n\nb. Insulin sensitivity can be cured with Baikal skullcap\n\nc. Minerals like zinc to decrease lysine and magnesium to boost blood flow and address calcification.\n\nd. Anti-fibrotic agents like taurine, serrapeptase and pirfenidone\n\ne. Fat grafting is also another proven method to grow hair\n\nf. Topical Sildenafil (Viagra) for blood vessels\n\ng. Botox Injections to scalp for fibrosis\n\nh. Topical Rosemary Oil for blood vessels\n\ni. Topical Sildenafil (Viagra) increases blood flow to scalp\n\nj. Topical Adenosine dilates blood vessels, increasing blood flow.\n\nk. Topical Caffeine for blood vessels\n\nl. PLATELET-RICH PLASMA (PRP) works by improving follicle vascularization\n\nm. Hyaluronic acid provides moisture to the skin from inside\n\nn. **Dexpanthenol** (**oral** and **topical**) is a precursor of vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It works as a moisturizer, improving skin hydration and elasticity. It also activates fibroblast proliferation, which is important in wound healing. It also increases vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene expression in dermal papilla cells. It also increases SULT1A1 (sulfotransferase, which is like a stimulant)\n\n7. **Nutritional Deficiencies:**\n\n**Causes:** Selenium, zinc, vitamin C, and iron are hair's essential allies. Selenium fuels antioxidant defences, zinc regulates oil production and inhibits 5α-reductase, vitamin C aids iron absorption, scalp circulation, and in formation of VEGF, and iron nourishes hair follicles. Iron is a cofactor for RNR, which is important for cell growth. Also hair follicle acts as site of storage of iron in the form of ferritin. Hair growth will be compromised in iron deficiency, and you won’t see iron deficiency. But iron supplementation is dangerous. So take iron through vegan foods only, like Moringa. Vitamin C and Vitamin A enhance absorption of iron. Need highly acidic stomach to absorb iron better, so consume ACV before each meal.\n\nHistidine deficiency was observed in > 90% of AGA,\n\nLeucine deficiency in 100% of AGA\n\nAlanine deficiency in 91.18% of AGA\n\n**Cures:** Fill your plate with diverse fruits, vegetables, and supplements of copper, iron, zinc, B vitamins, D, selenium\n\n8. **Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease:**\n\n**Causes:** Excess histamine aka allergic history aka rhinitis aka sinusitis likely means liver issues. This silent enemy disrupts hormone balance and metabolism, impacting hair growth. Address histamine imbalances through diet and consider supporting liver health. The liver removes hormones and toxins from our bodies including free testosterone and DHT. If it starts to underperform, levels of these hormones rise\n\n**Cures:**\n\n1. Silymarin (milk thistle), kutki\n2. If lot of mucus is accompanying hair loss take NAC to loosen the mucous and Anu taila through nose to aid the liver\n3. Oral Aloe vera is great for liver\n4. &#x200B;\n5. **Hormonal Imbalances:**\n\n**Causes:**\n\na. DHT binds to androgen receptors in hair follicles, causing them to shrink\n\nb. The oil glands (sebaceous glands) are like little workshops that can make both estrogen (E2) and androgens (like T and DHT). They do this using a special enzyme called aromatase. The aromatase enzyme converts androgens into E2, boosting its levels in the area. E2 binds to its receptors on the hair follicles, and extend the anagen (growth) phase. E2 can lower the production of DHT, and also increase its own production by ramping up aromatase activity. The hair follicles are like the control centers. They have receptors that listen to signals from both E2 and androgens. If E2 signalling is more potent it remain in anagen phase and if androgens are more in the microenvironment then it enters thinning and shedding.\n\nc. Thyroid hormone (T3 n T4) imbalances can cause alterations in the hair growth cycle.\n\nd. Increased cortisol levels can cause hair follicles to enter the telogen (resting) phase\n\ne. The liver removes hormones and toxins from our bodies including free testosterone and DHT. If it starts to underperform, levels of these hormones rise\n\nf. ***Insulin resistance:*** Hormonal profile of men with AGA and that of women with PCOS is very similar. Major cause of PCOS is insulin resistance\n\ng. Decreased dopamine levels lead to increased GnRH secretion,\n\nh. Deficiencies in iron, vitamins like B6 and B12, and certain amino acids, **chronic stress**, oxidative stress can all lead to decrease in dopamine synthesis by the hypothalamus, Dopamine directly inhibits prolactin secretion from the pituitary gland. When dopamine levels decline, this inhibitory effect weakens, leading to increased prolactin.\n\nWhy do so many people who are addicted to masturbation also see hair loss? People who are depressed have really low levels of dopamine, and these people masturbate a lot (binge eat, eat high sugar foods), to get the experience of dopamine surge for momentary relief from the depression. The excess masturbation does not in itself cause the hair loss, but does lead to Zinc deficiency, and also increased prolactin – both of which cause hair loss. Plus, as one loses hair he gets more depressed and the vicious cycle repeats itself.\n\n**Cures:**\n\na. **Ashwagandha**, meditation, and **L-ornithine** can help manage cortisol\n\nb. **Shatavri** to increase estrogen in males\n\nc. Consume sprouted **fenugreek** to safely increase estrogen in the body\n\nd.\n\n10. **Oxidative Stress:**\n\n**Causes:** Free radicals, the villains in this story, damage hair follicles. Increased ROS causes increase in TGFβ-1, leading to fibrosis, and also inhibits hair follicle function. ROS also leads to Altered immune response.\n\n**Cures:**\n\n1. Boost level of intrinsic antioxidants like – Glutathione peroxidase which depends on **selenium (Brazil nuts)**, and Catalase and Superoxide dismutase depends of **copper and zinc.**\n2. Antioxidants like vitamin D3, omega-3 oils\n3. Red light therapy\n4. Topical melatonin\n5. Remove pollutants, smoking etc., which cause ROS\n6. Astaxanthin\n7. Oral Tocotrienol / Vitamin E complex acts as an antioxidant\n8. Guava leaf extract acts as antioxidant and blocks DHT\n9. Resveratrol\n10. **Genetics:**\n\n**Causes:** The enzyme 5α-reductase converts testosterone and some DHEA (adrenal steroid) to DHT. High levels of 5α-reductase and high levels of free testosterone lead to increased DHT. Interestingly, MPB patients also have **low total testosterone but high free testosterone. In regular people, most testosterone is bound to SHBG (sex hormone-binding globulin) and some to albumin, leaving only a small portion as free testosterone.**\n\n**The ideal approach to prevent hair loss would be to increase bound testosterone by raising SHBG and albumin levels. Albumin is linked to liver health and thyroid health**. High free testosterone increases TGF Beta 2, leading to hair follicle shrinkage and hair loss. DHT also triggers\n\nhair follicle cell death and regression through DKK-1.\n\nThyroid disorders, liver diseases, or insulin resistance lower SHBG production. Estrogen increases SHBG synthesis.\n\n**Cures:**\n\n1. Eat fiber and reduce sugar to raise SHBG.\n2. High sugar and dairy intake might increase 5α-reductase activity.\n3. DHT blockers like saw palmetto and pumpkin seed oil,\n4. Maintaining a healthy omega-3 to omega-6 ratio,\n5. Avoiding trans-fats\n6. Liver health\n7. Spironolactone acts as a competitive inhibitor of androgen receptors, particularly for DHT, it also inhibits the enzyme 5α-reductase\n8. Topical **ALFATRADIOL** aka estrogen/indirect anti androgen. Alfatradiol acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme 5α-reductase. Approved for female pattern hair loss\n9. Topical FLURIDIL 2% blocks AR receptors\n10. Topical Rice bran oil (RBO) blocks 5α-reductase\n11. Pygeum africanum  contains compounds ike atraric acid and N-butylbenzene-sulfonamide which act as antagonists (cling to) of the human AR receptors\n12. Astaxanthin also lowers DHT\n13. Topical and Oral Mango leaf Juice which lowers DKK1 which reduces DHT\n14. Onion Extract / Black Seed Oil block DHT\n15. &#x200B;\n16. Growth Stimulants: These are items which stimulate hair growth by promoting differentiation and initiation of anagen phase and/or increasing the activity of hair follicle stem cells.\n17. Vitamin D3\n18. Topical REDENSYL\n19. Topical Stemoxydine\n20. 12 grams MSM per day along with 3 grams of vitamin c as it helps absorption of MSM. MSM is thought to either promote the conversion of telogen to anagen or lengthen anagen, mainly due to the deliverance of sulphur to the middle layer of the hair\n21. &#x200B;\n\n**Final Downstream Micro level Cause of Hair Fall which is caused by a combination of all or some of the factors above**\n\n**Micro-inflammation** at the dermal papilla of hair follicle – increased IL-1Alpha and IL-1Beta. At a micro level inflammation leads to decreased PGE2 and increased PGD2. Hallmarks of inflammation include decreased blood supply at the root of hair follicle and cut-off of nutrient and oxygen supply.\n\n**Cures:**\n\na. Colourful fruits and vegetables rich in quercetin and kaempferol\n\nb. Green tea's EGCG\n\nc. Topical Diclofenac\n\nd. Topical CBD - Hemp Extract\n\ne. Topical Turmeric oil\n\nf. **Topical Cetirizine** is a well-tolerated antihistamine with anti-inflammatory effect, reduces PGD2 that inhibits hair growth and increases PGE2 that promotes it\n\ng. Topical Adenosine suppresses inflammation\n\nh. Topical Stemoxydine reduces PGD2\n\ni. Hair follicles express specific receptors for PGF2α (prostaglandin), called FP receptors. PGF2α attaches to these receptors and promotes inflammation around the hair follicle. **Latanoprost** and **Bimatoprost** are a prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) analogues, meaning it mimics the structure of PGF2α and binds to FP receptors and leads to Increased nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI2) production which increase blood flow to follicle. PGF2α and its analogs plays the same role, just that Latanoprost and Bimatoprost are more potent in doing the job. But Latanoprost and Bimatoprost are needed in high concentration and cost is prohibitive.\n\nj. Topical Methyl Vanillate activates the WNT/β-catenin pathway aka reduces inflammation in scalp\n\nk. VPA inhibits an enzyme called GSK-3β, which in turn triggers the Wnt/β-catenin pathway\n\nl. Alantolactone suppresses inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress\n\nm. Oral Tocotrienol / Vitamin E complex acts as an anti-inflammatory\n\nn. Topical Fresh Aloe Vera (with or without skin) accelerates wound healing and has shown great results anecdotally. Potential inflammation killer.\n\no. Ecklonia Cava regulates both antioxidative and anti-inflammatory processes\n\n**Liquorice Tea -- Herb with multiple impact** : As an adrenal tonic, it improves energy & stress tolerance. It aids wound healing, is anti-inflammatory, and builds moisture. It is estrogenic, anti-testosterone, anti-oxytocic & anti-prolactin.\n\nThere are many more such herbs.. please add guys!\n\n**Remember, Patience is Key:** Hair growth is a marathon, not a sprint. Give the remedies at least 6 months to show their true colours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis person has the most powerful explanation of MPB on this planet.

        "body": "Ohh ooh, I got this. \nI've been getting ready to move and I've been cutting back on cookware, and researching what's worth keeping. I've got two SS pans that I've been playing with, and reading about. \nSo what I'm currently doing is: \nIf I want to cook something like eggs with a nonstick surface, I'll preheat the pan until a drop of water dashes around the pan like crazy, then add some vegetable oil (olive oil has a lower smoke point and might not work so well). Immediately or right before, drop it down to a low medium heat. The pan is 'charged' with heat, and if it has a thick bottom with an aluminum sandwich, it will stay perfect while cooking. The oil will start smoking a little. Perfect. When you get oil smoking, it's transforming at the contact point with the metal and beginning to polymerize[1]. You don't want it to turn black like with a cast iron; that is a much more complicated process and they can take the heat needed to polymerize oil to a great nonstick surface[2]. If you have too much heat, take it off the burner entirely. If you drop an egg on, you don't want it to explode; just a nice sizzle (you have to get to know your pans and how they react; I ate a lot of eggs this week experimenting).   \nAlternatively, you can add a layer of oil first, then heat up the pan to beginning to smoke, then immediately remove from heat. That will achieve about the same effect, and give you a vaguely mirror like coating on the pan which is stick-resistant. You should need less or no oil to cook an egg. After forming that thin semi-polymerized layer, hard cookware and soap will remove the coating, so be gentle.   \nIf you want to make a gravy though (or brazing beef/chicken), wash with soap and water to remove any semi-polymerized oil. The steel will chemically bond to the meat, forcing GREAT heat transfer, giving you a cripsy skin. Once you see the meat beginning to peel away from the pan, it's most likely ready to let go and you can turn it to a new side. You WILL end up with stuck bits, 'frond' or 'foundation', which can be deglazed with any liquid to make a nice gravy [3].  \n[1] I've also seen a professional chef describe the situation as the metal changing shape and smoothing itself, forcing oil to sit on top. However, chemically, the oil should be polymerizing as well, and will remain after a good wiping down.   \n[2] Cast irons will polymerize oil into a plastic substance, basically the original teflon. After that, you bake them/cook them until you get a perfect, tough polymer coating (and many layers of it). Cast iron can take the heat without warping, but stainless/aluminum will often warp.  \nAdditionally there is Carbon Steel, which has a lower carbon content than cast iron (yes), which can take the heat to form a full polymer coating, but will rust like cast iron, where SS has enough chromium to form a protective oxide layer.   \n[3] If you accidentally stick something to a pan that you didn't want to stick, you can make cleaning way easier with deglazing. Stuck egg? Beef? Fish? Once you'r done with the pan, add some water, put it on medium-high, and step away until you have a nice boil. Scrape with a soft utensil and everything besides heavily polymerized fats will come right off. :)   \nEdit/tldr: If you want nonstick, form a nonstick polymerized coating by making high temp oil smoke a tiny bit first. If you want gravy/brazing, start with a perfectly clean pan, get hot, add meat, let sit until meat doesn't resist. For easy cleaning, boil water, scrape frond out.",

It smells plasticky to me.\n\n-1 point for the weird waxy feeling of this crea on my skin. \n\nBesides for that, this cream is absolutely perfect. Its moisturizing, its thick, and its occlusive. It took me 2 years to finish this because I really disliked the waxy feeling when I first started using it so I stopped for about 6 months. Then I came back to it and have been using it consistently once a day before sleeping. \n\nBesides for the discontinued Laneige Timefreeze sleeping mask, this is a good moisturizer for my very dry skin; skin so dry that it would flakes off in small pieces during the winter months if I dont apply moisturizer. \n\nWorks great under makeup for me, but it may be because I have dry skin so it gets absorbed in quickly. However I could imagine that makeup would be slippy on top on a layer of cream if your skin is less dry than mine. \n\nRight now Im exploring other creams to find my holy grail but if I cant find anything, I would fall back on this one. \n\nMy ranking of best moisturizer for my dry skin: \n\n1. Laneige Timefreeze sleeping mask. (Discontinued)\n\n2. Etude Soon Jung 2x Barrier Cream (od version-discontinued). This one was slightly less moisturizing, but it beats the Kikumasamune one for being scentless and came in an easy squeeze tube. \n\n3. Kikumasamune Sake Cream\n\n4. Illyoon Ceramide Ato Cream. Nice squeeze tube. Tube is really wide though. No scent. Non-fussy. \n\n5. Laneige Cica sleeping mask. Pleasant scent. Jar. Less moisturizing than the above 3 but has a nice calming effect thats helpful in the summertime. \n\n6. Hanyul Rice cream. Perfumed rice scent. Great moisturizer. Bouncy cream texture. More expensive than most of the other ones on this list. \n\n7. Hanyul Pure Artemisia cream. Lovely calming cream. Really similar to the Laneige cica cream. Pricier than the other products on this list. \n\n8. Sulwhasoo Overnight Vitalizing Sleeping mask. Great daytime moisturizer. Too much ginseng breaks me out though.  ",

Total fat consumption (calorific point of view)\n2. Total Saturated Fat Consumption\n\nThe first has to do with what is the overall weight, body fat etc. In general about staying within the Body Mass Index Limit for weight. For people with heart conditions or diabetes, even better to stay towards the lower end of the range. \n\nThe second is mainly about avoiding fried food, processed meat products (which use lots of fat to fill volume), butter etc. Within Vegetable oil, the choice of oil has very little effect on the cholesterol, theoretically some oils are better than others, yes but practically that has little impact as compared to overall diet and exercise. \n\nAlso, reducing fat intake is not just about overall reduction but about maintaining decent ratio of good fats to bad fats. So one also needs an intake of good sources of fats. \n\nThis is a brief summary by Harvard Health: https://www.health.harvard.edu/cholesterol/cholesterol-and-heart-disease-the-role-of-diet\n\nAll these advertisements for healthy oils etc. etc. are exploiting the fear and ignorance of consumers to sell much costlier products.",

Rather, it is a symptom of an enzyme missing in humans that is needed in order to make ascorbic acid (vitamin C) from glucose in the liver - the enzyme gulonolactone oxidase, or GLO. \n\nBecause humans cannot make vitamin C in the liver like most animals, they require high levels of ascorbic acid in the diet in order to manufacture the vast amounts of collagen required for the maintenance of blood vessels, bones, disks, organs, skin, ligaments, cartilage, tendons, and teeth. The coronary arteries typically suffer the scorbutic (scurvy) effect from the lack of vitamin C and collagen and begin to deterioriate first because they are subject to the greatest degree of mechanical stress from the pumping action of the beating heart. \n\nWithout collagen, the ground substance (intima) of the blood vessels becomes weak and watery, which in turn allows lipoprotein(a) cholesterol to penetrate the tissue to \"patch\" the blood vessels so that they do not rupture and kill you much sooner than a heart attack would.\n\nThis patching mechanism occurs because lipoprotein(a) fat (a subset of LDL fat) is naturally attracted to lysine, which naturally is found in an artery wall but only exposed to the fats swooshing by in your blood when the artery is deficient in collagen and thus deteriorating.  The process whereby the body utilizes cholesterol in this way in the absence of collagen through vitamin C deficiency is quite miraculous, and despite the bum rap that cholesterol has gotten for years as being the \"cause\" of heart disease, it is actually a lifesaving response to patch weak arteries.",

Note also i've reduced the quantities a bit from what we do in store, scale up as desired of course.\n\nPlease learn to make it at home.\n\n## Chipotle Honey Vinaigrette\n\n### Ingredients:\n\n- 1 chipotle chili (canned in adobo sauce)\n- 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 3 tablespoons honey\n- 1 teaspoon dried oregano\n- 1/4 cup red wine vinegar\n- 1/2 cup rice bran oil (or any neutral oil of your choice)\n- Salt and black pepper, to taste\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Chipotle Chili:**\nRemove one chipotle chili from the can of chipotles in adobo sauce. You can adjust the amount depending on your desired level of spiciness. Finely chop the chipotle chili. You can also use a bit of the adobo sauce for extra flavor if you prefer.\n2. **Blend the Dressing:**\nIn a blender or food processor, combine the chopped chipotle chili, ground cumin, minced garlic, honey, dried oregano, red wine vinegar, and a pinch of black pepper.\n3. **Blend Until Smooth:**\nBlend the mixture until smooth and well combined.\n4. **Add Oil:**\nWith the blender or food processor running, slowly drizzle in the rice bran oil. This will help emulsify the dressing and give it a creamy consistency.\n5. **Adjust Seasonings:**\nTaste the dressing and season with salt and more black pepper if needed. You can also adjust the amount of honey, chipotle chili, or other seasonings to your preference.\n6. **Store:**\nTransfer the Chipotle Honey Vinaigrette to a glass jar or container with a tight-fitting lid. Store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.\n7. **Serve:**\nUse the vinaigrette to dress salads, drizzle over grilled vegetables, or use as a marinade for meats. Shake the container well before each use to ensure the ingredients are well combined.\n\n*Enjoy your homemade Chipotle Honey Vinaigrette with the flavors of black pepper, chipotle chili, cumin, garlic, honey, oregano, red wine vinegar, rice bran oil, and salt!*",

    "body": "Blessed Be, I am Witchthief.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been rather silent for the past few months. Life has a way of bringing you the unexpected. I've also been hard at work writing my books, and I get a little lost in research. So, I am unlikely to be as active as I once was, I'm still working on the books after all. However, I wanted to give you a sampling of what is to come, and to let you know that I do still read everything, even if I may not respond to everything. Below you will find a section from my book on beginner witchcraft.  With out further ado, let's get to it shall we?\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What is Candle Magic?\n\nCandle magic is a very old and simplistic style of magic. However, just because it is simplistic does not make it any less powerful. A knife is a simple tool, and praised for it's versatility. Candle magic is similar.  To illustrate this we will go over several common candle magic spells, as well as methods to shape and create your own spells. You should always strive to create your own spells. A spell you make yourself has more meaning and is better tailored to your individual needs. However, do not be afraid to ask more advanced practitioners for advice. That is what we are here for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe most basic candle spell is a banishment spell. When it is dark, and you feel alone and scared. Light a candle. Now you can see, and what was once a mystery in darkness is now revealed to you.  This sounds mundane doesn't it? Of course a candle lights the darkness. That is what they do. However, do not doubt the power and impact this single act has had. When mankind first made fire it was the start of our dominance of the planet. It removed the shackles of the primitive world and is the one constant every innovation relies upon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith this in mind, candles can be used to reveal secrets. They are a common ritual tool with black mirrors for this purpose. However, what else can a candle do? It can represent fire and light, but it can do more than that as well. A candle with a scent can help you relax, and focus your mind. It can help you meditate. It can direct energy, and seal something shut with wax. Preventing it's escape.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany witches are familiar with the process of \"Dressing a Candle\" however, for those of you who are not... Dressing a candle involves either softening the wax of a candle and rolling it in a collection of herbs, or placing items inside the wax well  that sit there as the candle burns. These herbs and items are often dependent on the spell being cast. Love spells, might use cornflowers. A banishment spell might use rosemary or sage. However, you are not limited to herbs. Oils can also be added, as well as crystals, and other objects that may play into your spell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow, a candle is fire. Fire is dangerous. Therefore properly understanding how to safely use candles is important. For some this seems obvious, but I have watched a man stack folding chairs on top of a rolling pallet to change a lightbulb 30 feet in the air, so, here we are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Candle Safety Tips:\n\nMake sure your candle is resting on a flat, and level surface. A tilted surface can cause the wax to drip in odd ways and that can damage items you may not want covered in wax, or burn thing depending on the wax temperature.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMake sure there are no loose flammable items near the open flame of the candle. This can be dangling strings, ribbons, tapestries, paper, curtains, or other things of that nature. Though a candle may look safe because of it's small flame. Never forget that fire is unpredictable and will spread at it's own volition. Additionally, just because somethings isn't IN the flame doesn't mean it cannot burn from the flame. Heat travels upwards and dissipates as it travels a further difference. So keep the candles' airspace free from debris.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDust and powder are explosive. It doesn't matter what kind of dust. This can happen with cooking flour, and even dusting off a rug. Do not dust around an open flame.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlace the Candle in a fire safe vessel. This can be something as simple as a metal plate, or even a dinner plate. You can also use sand in a cauldron, which is a particularly popular one. Even if the candle comes in glass that does not guarantee it's fire safety. Always elevate the candle slightly from a wooded surface regardless of the type.  Think of it as an excuse to get some fun candlesticks if you want them as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBe careful what you dress your candle in. Some materials are more or less flammable than others. As a rule, do not dress a candle in oil with out having a large fire safe vessel to put it in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNever leave a candle unattended.  If you have to run to the washroom, you're probably fine. However, if you are leaving the room for an extended period of time, put the candle out. Yes, even if it's dedicated to your gods. Snuff it just to be safe. Your gods will understand. A burnt worshiper can't continue to worship right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo not add highly combustible materials to a candle. Sulfur, magnesium, iron and aluminum oxide (thermite), saltpeter (gunpowder), petroleum (gas), etc. This is also true with crystals that may contain these elements. There are other crystals you should never add to a candle for different reasons as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNever move a container of hot wax. If you are heating wax in a crock pot DO NOT MOVE the crockpot, no matter how safe you think you are being. It is very dangerous. Use smaller transfer devices, but do not move the large container until it has cooled down.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Candle Dressing:\n\nThe range of things that one can dress a candle with is so vast, I cannot list all of them. However, be sure to understand your ingredients before dressing the candle. Both the mundane and magical properties. Mandrake root for example is harmless to the touch, but toxic if burned. Some things should simply not go on a candle or in fire. It is up to you to inform yourself, and understand what these things are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI typically suggest being light with the dressing of candles. A little bit goes a long way, and wasting ingredients is never fun. However, this is also because you do not want to choke the wick. Too much stuff and you might stifle the oxygen needed to keep the candle lit, or worse, it will burn out of control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA simple candle dressing:\n\nSoften the wax, add rosemary, cornflower, thyme, and a rose quartz.\n\nThis is a simplistic love spell designed to bring love to you, and help you navigate relationships. Once the candle had burned down, the spell is complete.  I suggest using a small pink or red candle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnderstanding ingredients applies doubly to oils. Not all oils burn at the same temperature, and not all oils will burn evenly and efficiently. Below is a chart of common oils and their smoke point, which is when the oil starts to combust.  Remember many oils \"Pop and Spit\" as they heat. Be careful this can lead to burns. If you have ever dropped a frozen food in to hot oil you know exactly what I am talking about.\n\nSafflower Oil 510°F/265°C \n\nRice Bran Oil 490°F/260°C \n\nLight/Refined Olive Oil 465°F/240°C \n\nSoybean Oil 450°F/230°C \n\nPeanut Oil 450°F/230°C \n\nClarified Butter 450°F/230°C \n\nCorn Oil 450°F/230°C \n\nSunflower Oil 440°F/225°C \n\nVegetable Oil 400-450°F/205-230°C \n\nBeef Tallow 400°F/205°C \n\nCanola Oil 400°F/205°C \n\nGrapeseed Oil 390°F/195°C  \n\nLard 370°F/185°C \n\nAvocado Oil (Virgin) 375-400°F/190-205°C \n\nChicken Fat (Schmaltz) 375°F/190°C  \n\nDuck Fat 375°F/190°C \n\nVegetable Shortening 360°F/180°C \n\nSesame Oil 350-410°F/175-210°C \n\nButter 350°F/175°C \n\nCoconut Oil 350°F/175°C  \n\nExtra-Virgin Olive Oil 325-375°F/165-190°C \n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Candle Colors:\n\nThe color of the candle can matter depending on the spell you are doing. However, a white candle can substitute any color. So if you don't happen to have the right color, don't stress over it.  Below you will find a chart with the common colors and meaning behind the candles.

Inactive, Active, and Complete. The state of the candle will determine the state of the spell it is being used for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAn inactive candle is simply a candle that is not burning. In this state it is either dormant, or is awaiting the application of your spell work. A spell that has been cast on a candle, that is now inactive, will remain dormant, and should NOT be cleansed until it has burned to completion.  However, this means that if you have to leave the house, or do something else, or just are tired of the burning candle, it's perfectly acceptable to snuff a candle and restart later. You spell will pick up from where you left off. That is one of the biggest advantages of candle magic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAn active candle is one that is currently burning. This will activate any spell work that has been cast onto the candle, as well as operate as an energy source, and a representation of the element Fire. Burning sigils, or other thing in a candle is one common method to activate your spell work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA complete candle is one that had burned through it's wick. Depending on the state of the wax you may be able to recover the wax, and reuse it by making it into a new candle. Make sure to cleanse the reclaimed wax if you are doing this. However, this is not always possible. If the wax is not reclaimed the long lasting potency of the candle comes into play. The wax will \"remember\" the spell cast upon it, and you can use the residual energies to add to spell work in the future. This is done by reusing the holder of the candle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, from time to time you may need to clean the wax up. Not only is it good house keeping but it can help control wax flows on subsequent candles. Wax likes to build upon itself. A handy tip to keep in mind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCandles can be used in Divinatory practices called \"Reading the Wax.\" This is done by letting the wax drip into water and reading the cooled wax shapes. However, this is one of the least accurate methods of divination. The more accurate divination tool is watching the candle flame. Watching the flicker can act as a pendulum substitute, and can be a way to gauge answers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce more, the simplest form of candle magic is for protection. A candle flame will always move when the air current is disturbed. This can be used to warn you of spiritual presences if there is no airflow, and according to some Taoist traditions, can tell if someone is telling you the truth or lies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSigil Carving is common on candles due to wax being a soft medium. When a sigil is carved on a candle it will act much like a sigil on paper, but will be more energetic and more powerful. Spell work done on candles is nice and easy, because it does not rely on your own energy. You are using the energy produced by the flame instead. This, is also a very basic form of Vampiric Magic, that is often used in Sorcery Practices. Sorcery does not use one's own energy outside of \"Weaving\" in the practice.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Candles and Crystals:\n\nMost crystals are safe in candles, but that does not mean all of them are. Depending on how hot your candle gets you may wish to avoid some fragile stones like Obsidian, Basalt, Mica, and other things that crack under heat. Additionally do not place toxic crystals in a candle especially ones containing Copper (Malachite), Zinc (Changoite), Cadmium, Sulfur (Pyrite), Or volatile alkaline metals like Potassium.  Sodium is ok. The fumes that come off of these metals are toxic and extremely hazardous and can lead to Heavy Metal Poisoning.  NEVER PUT PHOSPEROUS IN YOUR CANDLE! Phosphorus fires are EXTREMELY difficult to put out. It is a WAR CRIME to use white phosphorus as a weapon. Just keep that in mind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAside from the crystals you should not add, play around with any others you may have. Quartz, and other extremely hard crystals are usually a good choice. Not only because the heat will not damage them, but they are easily cleaned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen adding crystals to not overwhelm your candle's capacity. Some candles can hold more crystals than others, due to shape, and size. However, to many rocks just like with herbs, can choke and snuff the flame unintentionally.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nCandles are an extremely versatile and useful tool, and one that every witch should have cursory knowledge of. The depths of candle magic are as deep and varied as people so going over each and every tradition is not possible. There are many different spells that a candle can help you with, and many rituals that require lit candles. Keep a couple of small candles around, even if they are tea lights. You never know when you might need them. They might be just the thing to add a little extra omph.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn this section we did not talk about the sealing properties of wax, as that will be touched on in a different section. Wax sealing itself is a deeper subject that deserves it's own section and can be found later in the book. For this section, remember to experiment, try new things, and stay curious. Until next time, Ereshkigal's Blessings.",

    "body": "Hi Everyone! I have recently taken it upon myself to purchase and review body oils from many many different indie brands. I originally was going to post this as one big post but I have gathered so many oils and have so many opinions on them that I think it's best to break it up a little bit into a few different posts as I go along. If there's any oils you want to see reviewed, please let me know and I will do my best to get my hands on some. \n    \n**About my skin:** I have very dry, eczema prone skin. I have had psoriasis in the past but do not currently. I am sensitive on the inside of my elbows and behind my knees where the skin is thin.   \n  \n**What I like:** You will notice I prefer a bit of a thicker oil. I know this is not always everyones preference so I have also reviews some thinner oils. I try all the oils in the same way: Coating my body head to toe and sleeping with the oil on my skin. In the morning, my skin will either feel adequately moisturized  or still a bit dry.\n    \n**Sucreabeille (4oz = 8.00 USD, +/- 2.00 USD/oz)**  \n**Body Oil** (The Listing Attic: spiced apple cider, maple sugar, Kentucky bourbon)  \n**Ingredients:** Sunflower Oil, Rice Bran Oil, Pumpkin Seed Oil, Avocado Oil, Almond Oil, Vitamin E, Fragrance/Essential Oil.  \n**Notes:**  \n**Formula:** This is a good one. I love a true oil to wear, but want something that absorbs quickly. This fits that bill, coating my skin nicely but absorbing in about 15/20 minutes. Skin was very soft in the morning when I woke up. Wish this came in a dropper or spray (it’s one of those caps where you push the back down and it pops up to dispense, this formula is thick enough that you have to squeeze the bottle a bit, it won’t run out on its own).   **Also a note, the owner of Sucreabeille has moved her house blends to be their own brand now. Sucreabeille still exists but is used for her copycat / dupe scents. Her new brand “Hexennacht” carries this scent, and from what I can tell the same formula of body oil (ingredients list is the same).**  \n**Scent:** Ooooh, she’s a boozy one! Off the bat, out of the bottle, I get strong apple bourbon. On the skin, it’s a really even combination of all 3 elements, very balanced. I like it a lot, but I don’t think I’d wear it as a perfume. Really nice scent for Fall / Winter. Nothing left on my skin in the morning after sleeping with this on.  \n  \n**Exoskeletons (1oz = 24.00 USD, +/- 24.00 USD/oz)**  \n**Skin Elixir** (Tobacco: A balanced blend of sweetness and smoke. Blackened spices, deep dark vanilla, sweet resins, and charred wood. Smells like mahogany, like brass, like bookshelves filled with e.e. cummings, like a jukebox singing the blues.)  \n**Ingredients:** jojoba oil, fractionated coconut oil, rosehip oil, castor oil, coq10, alpha lipoic acid, essential oil blend, vitamin e, infused with organic cloves.   \n**Notes:**  \n**Formula:** I do like this formula as far as moisture and application. It goes on very nicely, is easy to spread, and I credit this product with turning my rough elbows baby soft in one application. This does not sink in as quickly as the Sucreabeille, in fact I think it’s the thickest oil I’ve tried so far. The only reason I won’t repurchase is because of the price. Of course, this has the nicest packaging out of everything, imo, which explains probably a lot of the higher cost.  \n**Scent:** Very strong. I believe this is a polarizing scent as although I love it, I have made a few people smell it who were either equally appreciative or a little bit revolted. This is mainly a strong clove. If I put this on before bed, the next day when I come home from work my entire room still smells of cloves.   \n  \n**Solstice Scents (4oz = 16.00 USD, +/- 4.00 USD/0z)**  \n**Burnishing Glacé** (Jack and the Devil: Jack & The Devil is part trick, part treat and all autumn delight. A blend of sugared golden pumpkin, spices, oakmoss, sweet vanilla, aged patchouli essential oil, and dried brown tobacco leaves [absolute]. )  \n**Ingredients:** Cyclomethicone NF, Fragrance and / or essential oil(s), Argan Oil, Rice Bran Oil  \n**Notes:**  \n**Formula:** I just wish this was more hydrating. It’s a nice, very light spray. I prefer to spray into my hand and then rub into skin as I find spraying directly results in some waste when the spray doesn’t hit your skin directly. This would be a better formula for summer, when my skin is not as dry. I like this for hair as well, but I don’t find the scent lingers in hair as much as it does on skin. I will most likely use this as a bath oil, which I will follow up with something thicker.  If you prefer a dry oil, that will absorb completely very quickly, this oil is for you.   **I do want to mention that I did have a little active eczema on the inside of elbow when using this, and it did sting a bit. Not enough that I washed it off, not enough that I stopped using it, but it did. This is something that Solstice Scents warns of on their website, since this is a spicy fragrance. I will continue to use it, but if you suffer from eczema or Psoriasis, I would take note.**   \n**Scent:** Scent is very strong on this one. Lasts nicely on the skin (though not in hair, for me), and this is one of my favourite indie scents for fall. Spicy, sweet, a little gourmand, a little masculine. Can smell it very faintly on my skin the next day, if applied before bed.  \n  \n**Cocoa Pink Silky Soft Body Oil (Greasy formula) (2 oz=5.80 USD, +/- 2.90 USD/oz)**\n(Winchester House Kitchen: The distinct aroma of autumn in the Winchester house kitchen with notes of aged oak, fresh baked pumpkin pie, 5 fold orange essential oil coated in the warm essence of light muscovado sugar, fresh ginger, sticky gobs of benzoin, warm buttery caramel simmering on the stovetop and just the barest hint of clove)  \n**Ingredients:** Sweet Almond Oil, Fractionated Coconut Oil, Fragrance oil, Apricot Kernel Oil, Olive Squalene, Jojoba Oil, Rice Bran Oil (greasy formula), Avocado Oil (greasy formula).  \n**Notes:**  \n**Formula:** I reaaaaaally like this formula you guys. As soon as I started using it I thought to myself “THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT”. This one definitely has to be sprayed into your hand because it just comes out as kind of a glop, not a spray. NBD because that’s how I apply them anyways. Really moisturizing, soaked in after about 10-15 minutes, and I woke up and my skin was soooo nice and soft. When I finish up all of these body oils, this is one I will definitely repurchase, in a few different scents.  \n**Scent:** Not at all what I expected! I kind of thought this was going to smell similar to Cinderella’s Carriage, based on the pumpkin, sugar, etc. but I barely get any sweetness at all. I get mainly ginger and aged oak (HONESTLY, I kind of get “recently polished wood furniture”) and when I woke up the next morning the slightest hint of caramel (could be in my head). Never got any orange. I don’t love it but I don’t hate it, and it doesn’t really linger so that’s fine.  \n\nWhew! Let me know if you have any questions about these scents or formulas. I have a lot more reviews to come: Epically Epic, Queen Bee, Alchemic Muse, Witch Baby... and some more Cocoa  Pink! Let me know if there are any formulas you would like to see me compare :)\n\n\n**Edit: Some formatting**",

The retail price of mustard oil (packed) has increased by 44% to Rs 171 per kg on May 28 this year, from Rs 118 per kg on the same date last year. The prices of soya oil and sunflower oil, too, have increased more than 50% since last year. (See graphic)\n\nIn fact, the monthly average retail prices of all six edible oils soared to an 11-year high in May 2021.\n\n# How much edible oil does India consume?\n\n*According to the latest data, each Indian consumed 19.5 kg of edible  oil every year on an average during 2015-16, up from 15.8 kg in 2012-13.  This amounts to an aggregate demand of around 26 million tons of edible  oils per year.*\n\nMustard oil is consumed mostly in rural areas, the share of refined oils —sunflower oil and soyabean oil — is higher in urban areas.\n\nBetween 1993-94 and 2004-05, monthly per capita consumption of edible oils increased from 0.37 kg to 0.48 kg in rural areas, and from 0.56 kg to 0.66 kg in urban areas. By 2011-12, it had risen further to 0.67 kg in rural areas and 0.85 kg in urban areas.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, the per capita availability of vegetable oils in the country has been in the range of 19.10 kg to 19.80 kg per annum during the last five years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyhi9qyl91271.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=847de42fda29eb73ead08b5939d14d8ae86d1c41\n\n# How much is produced domestically and how much is imported?\n\nAccording to the Agriculture Ministry, the demand for vegetable oils has been in the range of 23.48–25.92 million tonnes between 2015-16 and 2019-20. However, domestic supply in this period has been much lower, in the range of 8.63–10.65 million tonnes.\n\nIn 2019-20, domestic availability of edible oils from both primary sources (oilseeds like mustard, groundnut etc.) and secondary sources (such as coconut, oil palm, rice bran oil, cotton seed) was only 10.65 million tonnes against the total domestic demand of 24 million tonnes — a gap of over 13 million tonnes.\n\nThus, India depends on imports to meet its demand. In 2019-20, the country imported about 13.35 million tonnes of edible oils worth Rs 61,559 crore, or about 56% of the demand. This mainly comprised palm (7 million tonnes), soyabean (3.5 millon tonnes) and sunflower (2.5 million tonnes). The major sources of these imports are Argentina and Brazil for soyabeen oil; Indonesia and Malaysia palm oil; and Ukraine and Argentina again for sunflower oil.\n\nThis self-sufficiency continued till the Narsimha Rao government  signed the WTO agreement in 1994 and edible oil was put under OGL (Open  General License) with 65% duty. By 1998 we were again importing around [30% of our edible oil](http://www.taas.in/documents/pub-sp-06.pdf). We could never foresee then, what was in store in the near future.\n\n# Cultivation domesitcally\n\nIndia cultivated oilseeds on 25 million hectare of land, producing 32  million tons of oilseeds in 2018-19, with soybean, rapeseed and mustard  and groundnut accounting for almost 90 per cent share in the area.\n\nAssuming a country-wide average of 28 per cent oil recovery, 32  million tons of oilseeds will yield around 8.4 million tons of edible  oil. The domestic production can only meet a little over 30 per cent of  the total demand for edible oils, necessitating its import.\n\n# Role of Dhara Oil, remember the old ad\n\nIn 1977, the then finance minister, H.M. Patel  suggested to Dr  Verghese Kurien an “Operation Flood” like project for edible oils via a  farmers cooperative network based on the Amul model. The objective was  self-reliance in edible oils through increased productivity\n\nThe project was named Operation Golden Flow. Central to the operation  was the brand ‘Dhara’, which was created to build a market for the  Indian oilseed grower. It was inspired by the wordmark of Dalda in green  on a yellow background, the leader in vanaspati. This was a part of the  market intervention operation. Dhara was launched in Delhi on August  23, 1988. Dhara pricing was kept low due to economies of scale and  blending with the donated oil from CLUSA (Cooperative League of the  USA), a strategy taken from the ‘pump priming’ of donated SMP and  butter-oil during Operation Flood.\n\nThus, Dhara brought prices of domestic oil at par with cheaper imported edible oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yymlimt1c1271.png?width=957&format=png&auto=webp&s=627c6e8d6e980f28f45394b002dffdd82e2df952\n\n# Deliberate sabotage to discredit indigenous and loose oils and promote  imports.\n\nUnder the Vajpayee government, the import duty on edible oil was  further reduced to 15% in July 1998 and coincidentally the Argemone  adulteration Dropsy case took place in August 1998. Sixty people died  and around [3,000 got sick in Delhi](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/coverage/oils-not-well-9084)  and caught the nation’s attention. All of a sudden, all domestic brands  selling mustard oil became outcasts and even loose mustard oil was  banned. NDDB had to release advertisements to inform consumers not to  buy its trusted Dhara Mustard Oil. Out of fear consumers shifted to  ‘purer’ aromaless, colourless, tasteless oils or solvent extracted  refined oils, as we know them. Over the next few years, that black swan  event, led to a shift in the socio-cultural cooking and consumption  patterns of edible oil in the country.\n\nIndustry followers [consider it](https://www.independentsciencenews.org/health/indias-colourless-revolution-replacement-of-traditional-oils-by-soy-and-palm-oils/)  deliberate sabotage to discredit indigenous and loose oils and promote  imports. Mustard oil contaminated with argemone (essentially weed seed  contamination) is an ancient occurrence, but adulteration is never more  than 1%. In these cases, adulteration was up to 30%, with argemone,  diesel and waste oil as contaminants. The adulteration was therefore  done in such a way that it would kill, and do so conspicuously and  rapidly. Thus, the tragedy was seemingly not a result of the normal  business of adulteration.\n\nAs the then Delhi health minister Harsh Vardhan stated, this is not possible without an organised [conspiracy](http://www.ipsnews.net/1998/09/development-india-officials-helpless-as-spurious-oil-kills-50/).\n\n# Why are prices rising?\n\nThe increase in domestic prices is basically a reflection of international prices, because India meets 56% of its domestic demand through imports. In the international market, prices of edible oils have jumped sharply in recent months due to various factors.\n\nAnother reason is the thrust on making biofuel from vegetable oil. There is a shifting of edible oils from food basket to fuel basket.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/82388746d1271.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=011e6e76d58422e4fa3814b7979d0c5e9e6dc36e\n\n# How can government help farmers improve the yield per hectare\n\nIndia increase the area under oilseeds in India from 9 million tons  in 1986 to 32 million tons in 2018-19, though not sufficient to meet the  domestic demand.\n\n* Increase MSP minimum support prices of oilseed  crops\n* Improve quality of seeds\n* Optimum use of  agro-chemicals and better management.\n\n# Move away from rice cultivation, less water is needed too\n\nIndia has 11.7 mha of rice fallow, which can be  used for the cultivation of safflower and mustard crops, which don’t  need much water.\n\nAlternatives such as rice bran oil is gaining popularity amongst the  urban consumers, as it is known to reduce the risk of heart diseases and  type 2 diabetes. Rice bran constitutes about 8.5 per cent of the total  production of rice and has around 15 per cent content. Around 2 million  tons of edible oil can be produced using the available rice bran.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Sources:***\n\n[***https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/agriculture/how-india-can-be-atmanirbhar-for-edible-oil-production-75517***](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/agriculture/how-india-can-be-atmanirbhar-for-edible-oil-production-75517)\n\n[***https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/modi-govt-to-reduce-dependence-on-edible-oil-imports/articleshow/81135902.cms***](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/modi-govt-to-reduce-dependence-on-edible-oil-imports/articleshow/81135902.cms)\n\n[***https://theprint.in/features/dharas-jalebi-ad-from-the-1990s-still-means-home-and-family/421624/***](https://theprint.in/features/dharas-jalebi-ad-from-the-1990s-still-means-home-and-family/421624/)\n\n[***https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-why-edible-oils-are-costlier-7334810/***](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-why-edible-oils-are-costlier-7334810/)",

    "body": "I have a previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/gr8myg/death_and_floral_review_6_scents/) about my first impressions of D&F! In that post, I tested them right out the mail and some scents changed with time and others didn't. I left them alone for one month and /u/Potato_Quesodilla was totally right: aging helped a few of them really develop!! All of Brim's stuff is really well blended so I'll probably pick up some other samples on Ajevie.\n\n**Overall things to know**: Samples are made with the rice bran oil. Sillage is low, but can smell in your personal scent cloud. Longevity is low, maybe 3 hours. Brim switched to refined coconut oil, has a perfume primer, and also offers EDPs. All of those should help with throw and longevity.\n\n# Scents\n\n**Before you were dust**: *Herbal Bay leaves and black tea blended with sweet tobacco. The smell of a deep belly laugh, an old wooden cane, a worn out hat and a cracked leather jacket.*\n\n* **Bottle**: Tobacco and a sweet herbal/green note. What was once Big Red Hots cinnamon candy and clove has become a well-blended spiced note that is not overpowering.\n* **Skin**: Wow this really mellowed with age. This is sweet the way a beautiful cuban cigar / cigar box is. Tobacco sweet, not sugar sweet. I don't pick up the bay leaves or black tea, but they are probably well-blended supporting notes as this is not one-dimensional at all. Very lovely scent and it doesn't morph on my skin throughout the day.\n* **Overall**: Brim said this one would get better after 3-5 days of rest. I found it really took a couple weeks to start changing in the bottle. The longevity is only a couple hours but I can smell it all day if I huff my wrists. Not going to full size, but I'll be finishing the sample.\n\n**Two cups of tea, a monsoon, and me and you**: *Rain on cracked soil, wet creosote, a swelling monsoon, desert cedar, black tea*\n\n* **Bottle**: Smells of rain :)\n* **Skin**: Definitely petrichor. The dry down changed from plain wet dirt and has become more warm, grounded, and rainy. It smells like the air right after the rain stops and everything is damp and glistening in the sunlight. There is a floral note, which I'm assuming is creosote. As it wears, the petrichor note leaves, leaving a fresh woody garden scent behind. Not green just lightly floral.  \n*\\*\\*Add-in: This particular sample went to a friend who lived in AZ, and he confirmed the floral note is creosote. Said it is accurate and very pretty. This scent is more creosote forward and the creosote is more accurate than* ***Desert Thunderstorm*** *(EDP) by Solstice Scents.*\n* **Overall**: Super pretty, work-friendly, lightly floral rain scent. If I were keeping the sample, I would 100% go through the whole thing. If I smelled this on someone else, I would hover for just a little too long to sniff them. Really tempted to full size this one, but I'm trying to be really picky about full sizing..........must....resist....\n\n**Half-hoping to be eaten by a bear**: *Woody, sweet bare skin; the lingering scent of dry leaves on a cold morning.*\n\n* **Bottle**: Smells like....nothing? If I try REALLY hard, I can barely pick up pine.\n* **Skin**: Veeeeeeery faint. I'm less anosmic to this than initial impression. Hint of pine in this, but not a punch to the face like most pine scents on me. Definitely has a cool, dry tone to it...an impression of a fall day.\n* **Overall**: I almost smell it more the less I try to smell it. Nice scent, but too faint / I'm too anosmic to full size.\n\n**The sweater we buried you with is hanging in my closet**: *A luscious blend of three different vanillas, resinous ambers, Arabian sandalwood, a soft cashmere sweater*\n\n* **Bottle**: More explicitly vanilla after aging. Beautiful, soft, well-blended.\n* **Skin**: Just as lovely as the first time I tried it. I've worn this one several times now and it's very a very lovely, warm, non-gourmand vanilla.  Very pretty and sophisticated.\n* **Overall**: I put this on to relax one evening and I could still smell it on my skin the next day. A very comforting scent that will definitely be full sized as an EDP.\n\n**Dusty stacks of vinyl records on an antique store floor**: *Arabian sandalwood, dusty aged paper, cedar, warm stagnant air, patchouli, Vetiver, amryris, musk*\n\n* **Bottle**: After my initial impressions of it smelling like stale, moldy popcorn, I couldn't get it out of my head. It now has a mellower, prettier scent in addition but still off-putting. I am skeptical...\n* **Skin**: It stays full on stale, moldy popcorn on first application, but as it dries down over \\~10 minutes, it lessens (PHEW). It goes back and forth between popcorn and a different, more pleasant smell before finally drying down to the nice smell that is very reminiscent of a thrift store.  You know when you walk in and its a little stuffy, kinda crowded and junky inside, and the carpets probably need a good vacuum? It smells like that store. I think \"dusty\" and \"stagnant\" are pretty accurate. The longer it sits on the skin, the more ~~sweet~~ soft (?) it becomes. Maybe that's the sandalwood? I don't detect any patchouli, or perhaps its a white patch.\n* **Overall**: Freaking surprised by this. I was terrified to wear this again especially since the scent in the bottle was not promising. On the skin it dries down to a really nice atmospheric scent that is pretty accurate to its name. I can smell it within my scent range, so the sillage overall is low. Lovely and it's something I like wearing, but can't see myself reaching for it a lot. Won't full size this one.\n\n**Lay me in the earth, and from my fair and unpolluted flesh, let violets spring**: *Milky baby deer skin, soft fur musk, warm earth, oak trees, floral forest floor moss*\n\n* **Bottle**: Warm, comforting cologne.\n* **Skin**: This is pretty similar to how it smelled before. Like men's cologne after it has been on the skin awhile. Very comforting. I sniff my wrist a lot when I wear this and I like wearing it to sleep.\n* **Overall**: I wouldn't have expected to love this if I saw someone review this as \"men's cologne\", but I really like it a lot. It had the strongest sillage of all the scents. It wore for about 3-4 hours on me and I could smell it after sleeping with it on all night if I huffed my wrists. I could see myself full sizing this, but as an oil, rather than an EDP. I will see how often I reach for it first.\n\n**TL;DR:** Some of the scents (**Sweater, Bear, Lay Me in the Earth**) didn't change with 1 month of rest. Some (**Dust, Dusty stacks, Two cups**) changed to become more complex and true to their notes! All became stronger (except **Bear**) and had longer longevity. If you haven't tried some D&F scents, I highly recommend you do!\n\nThanks for reading :) Happy smelling!",

    "body": "**Intro (copy and pasted from my original post, fyi)**  \nHi Everyone! I have recently taken it upon myself to purchase and review body oils from many many different indie brands. I originally was going to post this as one big post but I have gathered so many oils and have so many opinions on them that I think it's best to break it up a little bit into a few different posts as I go along. If there's any oils you want to see reviewed, please let me know and I will do my best to get my hands on some.  \n**About my skin:** I have very dry, eczema prone skin. I have had psoriasis in the past but do not currently. I am sensitive on the inside of my elbows and behind my knees where the skin is thin.  \n**What I like:** You will notice I prefer a bit of a thicker oil. I know this is not always everyones preference so I have also reviews some thinner oils. I try all the oils in the same way: Coating my body head to toe and sleeping with the oil on my skin. In the morning, my skin will either feel adequately moisturized or still a bit dry.  \n  \n**Epically Epic (2.5 oz = 12.50 USD, +/- 5.00 USD /oz.)**  \n**Argan Oil mist** (Jemez: Piñon needles, lichen-covered cedar trees, black earth, and ponderosa pines with their unique vanilla scented bark. For a long time I have wanted to capture the scent of hiking in the New Mexico mountains when, above a certain elevation, the desert turns to rocky, lush, ponderosa pine forest. The Jemez is a range of (volcanic!) mountains to the Northwest of Santa Fe. )  \n**Ingredients:** Argan Oil, Rice Bran Oil, Fractionated Coconut Oil, Cyclomethicone, Jojoba, Olive Squalane, Fragrance and/or Essential Oils, Vitamin E.   \n**Notes:**  \n**Formula:** This is another middle of the road oil. It’s halfway between thick and thin and halfway between fast-absorbing and body-coating. I think this is one that most people would honestly really like, I think it’s a nice size, has good packaging. It didn’t wow me by any means, but I also have no complaints and will continue to use it.  \n**Scent:** When I first got this and put it on I was messaging u/yi_lin22 and I was like I AM AMPING THIS DIRT NOTE SO MUCH. It’s true that when this is first applied it honestly just smells like the ground to me. After about a minute that fades into a really pretty and very unisex, slightly Christmassy tree scent. There’s no spice, it’s LIGHTLY sweet, and it’s very enjoyable.  \n**Witch Baby (2 oz = 12.00 USD, +/- 6.00 USD/oz)**  \n**Body Oil** (Winters Bride: Winter's Bride is a romantic blend of black cherry, merlot, and seductive amber.)  \n**Body Oil** (Wolf Moon:Crisp juicy apples blend beautifully with cool woodsy pine. This seasonal blend is made with real antioxidant packed fir needle essential oil.  \n**Ingredients:** Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Salvia Hispanica (Chia) Oil,Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Fragrance (Phthalate Free), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, (Biodegradable glitter, in Winter’s Bride)  \n**Notes:**  \n**Formula:** This one is a little on the thicker side, but what I really like about this oil is it really seems to SPREAD well. Like for example, the Exoskeletons oil, I would need 6-7 drops to do ONE forearm. It was THICK (I say was because I am already out due to an unfortunate spill). This one I only need 3-4.  \n**Scent:** Winter’s Bride: Well, this one is not for me. I think wine notes in general go kind of funky on me. They smell just kind of ferment-y on my skin. Like rotten fruit a bit. Although I will say this is perfectly pleasant in the bottle! It doesn’t really scream winter or Christmas, just a nice sweet berry scent to me.  \nWolf Moon: Okay hear me out, For some of these reviews, on days when my skin was drier, I would apply the oils and let them sink in and then apply a body butter over top. (Someone on I think the first post I made recommended it, whoever you are, you rock, thank you!!) One of the body butters in my rotation right now is Trader Joe’s Coconut Body Butter. THIS IS AN AMAZING COMBINATION. It’s like sweet and woodsy and just so yummy in general. The scent on it’s own is really nice and I love using it when I use all my Christmas tree smelling stuff (HOG Snow Wolf Whipped soap, CP Black Forest Scrubbing Bubbles, etc.). From my reviews you can probably tell I’m not the biggest fan of fruity scents in general, but the apple in this just kind of makes it bright, and not too sickly.   \n  \nAnd that’s all my (indie) oils! Actually that’s a lie I just got 2 from Hexennacht which are the same as the Sucreabeille formula and they are MARSHMALLOW AF. They’re so good. ",

    "body": "#Why use oils in your hair?\n\nPlant oils are emollients used to soften hair or add “plasticity” or pliability. Pliable hair bends easily without breaking. Hair with oils applied to it lines up better with neighboring hairs thanks to the lubricating properties of oils (slip).\n\nWhen water absorbs into hair strands, the inside (cortex) swells but the outside (cuticle) cannot expand. This causes the cuticles to raise, in this position cuticles can break off, make hair more porous, and cause protein loss. Oils that are penetrating can help prevent this by making hair more water-phobic (water-repelling), preventing swelling from occurring. Penetrating oils can cause shorter dry-times.\n\nKeeping hair hydrated and moisturized helps with the health of your hair, prevents tangles, and helps the longevity of a hairstyle. Water will condition hair and adding water-based products like leave-in conditioner will help hydrate hair. To help your hair keep this hydration, sealing oils can be added to help prevent this moisture from leaving your hair. Sealing oils add shine, gloss, and lubrication to your hair.\n\n#Ways to use oils\n\n1) Oil pre-poo: Apply oil to your hair and leave it on for 4-12 or more hours before shampooing. The oil prevents dehydration and loss of proteins and protects and buffers your hair from water and shampoo. If you get the amount of oil and leave-on time right, your hair will be more flexible and feel softer, better lubricated and your curls will be better-defined. The longer you leave the oil on, the more oil will work its way into your hair.\n\n2) Added to a deep or intense conditioning treatment.\n\n3) To seal damp hair. You need some leave-on conditioner over your oil or a nice film-forming gel like flaxseed gel for hydration – oil alone does not hydrate your hair.\n\n4) Oil rinsing. Either mix 1/4 oil and 3/4 conditioner or 1/2 oil and 1/2 conditioner and use this as you would a rinse-out conditioner. Or apply the oil to clean, wet hair, then apply conditioner and squeeze and gently massage the oil and conditioner together in your hair. Then rinse and enjoy the very soft result.\n\n#Oil charts by penetration\n\nCredit to W.S. of [science-yhairblog](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com) for these awesome charts!\n\nThis top chart is oils that have been demonstrated in lab tests to penetrate the hair, and which should based on their chemistry. They are high in triglycerides and/or contain monosaturated lipids which can penetrate below cuticles. \n\n| Oils with high penetration | Penetration improves with heat? | Documented by research |\n|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Coconut oil                        | Yes                                               | Yes, excellent                  |\n| Ucuuba butter                    | Unknown                                     | Yes, good                        |\n| Sunflower oil                     | Yes                                               | Yes, depending on study |\n| Palm kernel oil                   | Likely                                          | No                                   |\n| Capric/Caprylic triglycerides   | Unknown                                 | No                                   |\n| Babbasu oil                         | Possible                                       | No                                   |\n\nThis chart is oils with some penetration. These are arranged based on their lipid composition from more likely to penetrate (top of that list) to less likely at the bottom of that list. \n\n| Oils with some penetration | Penetration improves with heat? | Documented by research |\n|--------|------------|--------|\n| Castor oil    | Unknown       | No   |\n| Olive oil    | Possible     | Yes, good  |\n| Avocado oil   | Possible     | No |\n| Corn oil   | Possible     | No |\n| Canola oil   | Unknown     | No |\n| Mustard seed oil   | Unknown     | No |\n| Sweet almond  | Unknown    | No |\n| Apricot kernel oil   | Unknown     | No |\n| Argan oil   | Unknown     | No |\n| Sesame seed oil   | Unknown    | No |\n| Shea butter  | Unknown     | No |\n| Peanut oil   | Unknown     | No |\n| Kokum butter   | Unknown    | No |\n| Grapeseed oil   | Unknown     | No |\n| Rose hip oil   | Unknown     | No |\n| Hemp seed oil   | Unknown     | No |\n| Flax seed (linseed) oil   | Unknown     | No |\n| Perilla oil   | Unknown     | No |\n| Safflower oil   | Unknown     | No |\n| Cocoa butter   | Unknown     | No |\n\nThis last chart is oils which do not penetrate the hair based on lab tests and/or their chemistry.\n\n| Oils with little/no penetration | Penetration improves with heat? | Documented by research |\n|--------|------------|--------|\n| Rice bran oil    | Unknown       | Poor penetration  |\n| Mineral oil    | -     | No penetration  |\n| Jojoba oil   | -     | No penetration |\n\n#Quick recommendations\n\nPenetrating oils for managing porosity and softness: Coconut oil, fractionated coconut oil, sunflower oil, babassu oil, olive oil, avocado oil, palm kernel oil, a blend of these oils and any others you like. Castor oil is good for some people's hair.\n\nSealing oils for slip and flexibility: Broccoli seed oil, jojoba oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil.\n\n#Does this oil work for my hair?\n\nGood oils for your hair: A good oil for your hair will add a little sheen, a smoother feel, and ease of detangling. Your hair will still have that sheen and smoothness hours later. You may need to re-apply the oil at some point between washes, but your hair should not be worse off after using the oil.\n\nOils that don't work for your hair: Limp, flat hair means your hair doesn't get along well with an oil or you used too much. Some bad signs are if your hair becomes dry, frizzy, waxy, brittle, tangly, stiff, crunchy or dull-looking. This may happen right away, or it may occur over the course of many hours, days, or weeks.\n\n##Hair gets crunchy or stiff or brittle with coconut oil (or another oil)?\n\nSome people get crunchy or brittle hair or rigid hair from coconut oil with its unusual fatty acid profile and saturated fat content. Try blending coconut oil with other oils or use a different oil like sunflower oil or babassu oil. Just about any oil can disagree with somebody's hair and create an unpleasant result.\n\n#Further Reading / References\n\nS, W. (2013, June 24). Oils – Which Ones Soak In vs. Coat the Hair?.

I found some really good results myself when I experimented with a blend of [organic, cold-pressed oils](https://link.littlebundles.co.uk/best-oil-for-curly-hair). This mixture not only made my hair noticeably softer and shinier but also managed to reduce frizz to a significant extent. It was a mix including some of the penetrating and sealing oils you've listed, like coconut, olive, sunflower and jojoba. In addition, it was an easy routine to follow, as it only required a few drops massaged into my hair after shampooing and conditioning, then left on as a leave-in treatment. It's all about finding what works for your hair, but this product could be a good place to start, especially if you're interested in introducing a blend of oils into your hair care routine. Plus, it is free of unnecessary additives and brings together the nourishing benefits of these oils you've listed.",

    "body": "Hello! I received a sample of the **strawberry milkshake shampoo bar from Athame and Alchemy** for free after a discussion with the owner when they saw my comment indicating curiosity about the product and a lack of reviews. I wanted to provide a review since I had been curious to see if there had been any out there when the new one had been released last time around. In other relavent information, I have only tried the waxes from Athame and Alchemy from last year's gift exchange (thank you! I'm an exceptionally big fan of #PSL but loved everything).\n\n**Hair deets:** a couple inches short of waist length, coarse and porous, prone to frizz in higher humidity, mix of waves and curls\n\n**Typical hair routine:** wash every 2-4 days, depending on how dirty it is. Shampoo to the scalp, rinse out elsewhere. Conditioner from the bottom up, tiny bit on the top. \n\n**Experience with solid shampoo:** Tried four other brands. The only terrible one was Lush before the most recent reformulation. Absolutely dried out my hair and left it brittle and stiff. Been using my preferred brand for nearly a year now. \n\n**Other notes:** This was a free sample sent to me after I mentioned that I would be willing to try it other than the shipping cost to Canada (no one's fault!). It did come via lettermail successfully, but did not stay intact. I decided to crush it more evenly then firmly press it into a round mold. It has mostly stayed intact since. This may have changed the foaming and delivery experience. \n\n**On arrival:**\n\n- Strawberry milk scented, slightly candied a bit of juicy tartness. Not overwhelming through the packaging, could smell several inches away dry\n- Arrived crushed and powdered. Pushed into mold and got mostly cohesive product. Just under 1 tbsp of product after reforming it. \n\n**First use:**\n\n- Wet, similar scent throw\n- Surprising amount of lather (possibly due to water saturation in air pockets from press though)\n- Silky touch to the foam that built quickly in my hands (preferred for me), also easy to apply straight to hair in along length motion, but did not try to rub due to press \n- First try, washed out with normal amount of foam, but only in targeted location\n- Second go immediately after, continued to add more foam until entire top of head felt silky with foam. Rinse out very easy, felt hair was almost stripped/clarified, but not dried out (felt similarly when first time using solid shampoo, likely overwashed, oops)\n- Shampoo scent does not have strong throw after shower, though scent is more milky\n\n**Round two:**\n\n- less foamy (now normal level), still quickly foamed, rubbed a bit into hair after initial foam layer\n- slightly sour scent? \n- no lingering scent, not stripping, left glossy hair when only conditioned lower half\n\n**Rounds three - five:**\n\n- consistent with round two. \n- Still have around 3-4 uses left if it's not too small. Significantly more than what is advertised, but I would get about 10 normal uses out of it. \n- Hair feels nice and cleaned, but requires a touch up on the third day consistently. Feels like a faint residue sticks around as a hydrating layer. \n\n**Value:** good independent of the price. Very good considering the price of competitors (not including those that claim soap = shampoo that aren't pH balanced), especially as you can purchase a larger form to cut down on shipping frequency. Currently priced at 13.75/large ones.\n\n**Ingredients:** Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Rice Starch, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Rice Bran Oil, Fragrance, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Citric Acid, Germall Plus (different for the Rosemary option)\n\n**Scent:** Ripe Strawberries, Buttercream Frosting, Vanilla Ice Cream, Caramel, Spun Sugar\n\n**More notes:** My partner also used the shampoo bar once and confirmed it smelled like strawberry milk. It looks as if there are still a few more uses left. Just from eyeballing it, it looks as if the sample size is around 2/3 of the usual sample size rounds from other brands, but I could have compressed it more due to it being crushed in transit. I also forgot entirely it was strawberry *milkshake* sceented. While I can see it, my mind definitely jumps to strawberry milk first. **Overall it's a very hydrating product that feels like it leaves a thin film on the hair. Overuse can turn it into a more stripping product if that's needed. The scent is light, but present, and washes out. I did not find that my hair colour faded exceptionally fast with its use. The texture of the foam was silky and on the low foam side initially, but it was easy to build up. I did feel like I had to wash my hair slightly more freqently than with other shampoo options. Value wise, if I could stock up and not get bored for two years, I would consider purchasing these even with the horrific shipping costs. The sample size is an excellent option to just give it a go if you use shampoo at the same rate as I do (usually double the number of uses listed).**\n\nFeel free to ask more questions! I've just copied over the notes I had on what stood out to me at the time.\n\nEdit: come to think of it, that slight filmy feel I get...I wonder if it reduces frizz? I haven't noticed any more during the test runs at least. Edit 2: I've actually tried four brands! One was so mediocre and drying that I wiped it out from my memory.",

I used a ton on the first try--really lathered it up in there--partly because it smells to good and partly because the foam does indeed feel so silky and lovely in my hair. When I rinsed, my hair felt a bit squeaky clean (not usually the goal for this curly head, but nice when I want to clarify a bit or need a deeper clean than usual) but also not super dehydrated/angry/rough like my hair can be with shampoo. Using it a bit more moderately, I like it a lot! The rest of my hair care routine needs some tweaking, so it's hard for me to say just on the basis of hair results, but the experience of using this bar is really lovey.

Use something simple such as extra virgin olive oil or almond oil to cleanse because it takes you less than five minutes to do OCM and the oil will be washed down the drain. You won't get any benefits unless you use them as a moisturizer.\n\nMacadamia nut and kukui nut are very light. I don't think it'll do anything for OCM because it can absorb fast. Both of them are suitable for oily skin.\n\nPomegranate oil is very expensive and thicker than maple syrup. It must be diluted with another carrier oil - no more than 20%, I think... Or that is 10%? It's really pointless to use it for OCM. Use it as a moisturizer. \n\nPumpkin seed oil is very rich and shouldn't use more than 10%. It goes the same with papaya seed oil - if you use full strength, it might irritate your skin.\n\nI'd go with rice bran oil and/or sesame seed oil as OCM and the rest of them should be used as moisturizers to have better benefits for your skin.",

    "body": "I had a lot of fun researching Solstice Scents and ordered during the restock/summer release at the end of July. Shipping and delivery went smoothly, the packaging was secure, and I’m feeling really conflicted about my dislike of most of these fragrances. Is it rude to post a bunch of negative reviews? And, maybe more importantly, is it disingenuous to not? \n\nWhat’s negative to me could be a positive to someone else; an over generalization, yes, but what’s the point of this forum if not for discussing fragrance being subjective by nature? \n\nMaybe I was lucky in my sampling endeavors with Alkemia — I think I’ve actively disliked one scent that I’ve purchased directly out of 15-20 — and unlucky with Solstice. Alkemia was my first foray into indies and it was love at first (and second) buy, so I haven’t explored much else. \n\nI also looked into the carrier oils used. Solstice uses rice bran oil while Alkemia uses sunflower, meadowfoam seed, and food grade mineral oils. I have no idea what that \\*really\\* means as far as my sniffing experiences, if anything at all, but perhaps my skin doesn’t care for rice bran.\n\nANYWAY -- if anyone has thoughts I’d love to hear them. I desperately want to find some incense fragrances to swoon over!\n\n**Astral Temple** \\- *Amber, Ginger, Orange, Clove, Patchouli, Vetiver, Frankincense.* \n\nThoughts - I was mentally prepared to get a smack in the face given the notes but it's really mild. All I can detect is a barely-there amber, ginger, and creamy orange. Where's the spice? Okay so after a couple minutes I can make out the clove, but I'm really concentrating. It's a nice smell but disappointing given my high hopes. Immediately disappears on paper, sticks around a tiny bit on skin. \n\n**Basilica** \\- *Labdanum, Vanilla, Frankincense, Rosewood, Myrrh, Sandalwood & Galbanum*\n\nThoughts - Again, I'm barely getting anything at all. Just a faint whisper of incense, some vanilla, maybe a little bit of lemony brightness, possibly some woodiness? On paper it stays at a bright lemony incense. The longer it sits the less I like it on skin though, it goes way too sour and green. \n\n**Conjure** \\- *Vanilla, Amber, Cedar, Spices & Cauldron Smoke*\n\nThoughts - this is a sweet, rich, ambery vanilla with a nice bit of soap to it. I'd normally categorize a soapy scent as cool and somewhat aquatic, whereas this is a warm and snuggly soap. About the same on paper versus skin. It's nice, but I probably wouldn't shell out money for a full bottle.\n\n**Coquina** \\- *Sandalwood, Orange Blossom, Clementine, Beach Sand, Plumeria, Coconut, Ginger, Incense & Seaspray*\n\nThoughts - I get sandalwood followed by coconut on paper; sandalwood, then salty sand, then a bit of plumeria on skin. I'm not getting any orange blossom or clementine. No ginger or incense either. It's okay, but it's mostly just a salty-sweet skin scent with a ghost of plumeria after a couple minutes. \n\n**Farmhouse in Spring** \\- *Daffodil, jasmine, citrus blossom, osmanthus, magnolia, cypress wood smoke, sun-warmed Earth*\n\nThoughts - First sniff is daffodil and maybe a little bit of jasmine on paper and the wood smoke never emerges; on skin I get a watery green daffodil, then sour wood smoke, and maybe a hint of jasmine if I think hard enough? It's not what I wanted it to be. The dry down is just sour smoke and I’m sad. \n\n**Heat of the Night** \\- *Vanilla, Mango, Coconut, Orange, Sandalwood, Amber, Orange Blossom, Edge of the Night Base. (Edge of Night is Black Vanilla, Soft Spices, Red Musk, Chypre Base.)*\n\nThoughts - Mmmmm, okay finally something nice! First whiff is creamy orange and mango. Where's the coconut? It kind of reminds me of PEZ candies. Dries down and I start to get the warmer vanilla and amber coming through. Fades really fast to nothing at all though, ugh. Come back! \n\n**High Desert** \\- *Desert Sage, Ceremonial White Sage, Sandalwood, Mitti, Cacti, Tobacco, Hay, Smoke, Labdanum, etc.*\n\nThoughts - I definitely get sage and I like it, but I can't help thinking of the smell of savory sage in chicken noodle soup. Lolll. Not too well-versed in desert versus white sage. I get some tobacco and hay as well, plus a slight camphor-like cooling sensation. I’m not well versed in mitti or cactus notes either, so I’m not sure what that’s from. Could also be the hay? It's nice, but it doesn’t feel like “me,” a girl who’s lived in the Midwest her whole life. I just don’t see myself wearing it. Fades quickly. \n\n**Nightgown** \\- *Vanilla, White Chocolate, Tuberose & Tiare Flowers.* \n\nThoughts - Luminously sweet. I'm not getting the white chocolate, but it's indeed a nicely blended vanilla, tuberose, and plumeria. I need to take this for a day-long test drive and see how it goes. \n\n**Pharaoh** \\- *Egyptian Musk, Honey & Frankincense Essential Oil.* \n\nThoughts - aquatic... vegetal... honey? I can't smell much of anything at all. Kept sniffing every ten minutes or so, and all I get is sour sweaty skin. Weird. \n\n**Spirit Tree** \\- *Gardenia, Vanilla, Jasmine, Sandalwood, Soft Woods blend, Orange Blossom, Magnolia.*\n\nThoughts - gardenia with a slightly alcoholic/medicinal afterthought; a little bit of jasmine as it dries down. I get more jasmine on paper than skin. A bit cloying. Gardenia can be really hit or miss for me so unless it’s an enthusiastic “yes!” I tend to avoid it for fear of triggering a headachey vom fest. I don't get any orange blossom or magnolia.\n\n\\*\\*free sample! **Victorian Picnic** \\- *Pound Cake, Loquat-Lemon Glaze, Orange Blossoms, Wisteria, Ladyfingers, Jasmine, Azalea Leaf & Reisling.* \n\nThoughts - very gourmand first whiff of caramel and vanilla cake, then I get the wisteria, then it goes a bit bitter green. I wish it would've gone the other direction with a green top note, then floral, then gourmand. Meh. If I’m going gourmand I’m going all in. I’ll mix my fruits and florals, but cake should exclusively go with more cake! This feels too... I don't know how too explain it... watery? Tinny? Blurry? It's not cohesive. \n\n\\*\\*free sample! **Iced Nectar** \\-*Vanilla Waffle Cone, Apricot Jam, Peach Mango Ice Cream, Tahitian Vanil****la***\n\nThoughts - yikes, okay so this is alcohol-based in a 1ml dabber vial. And after opening 10+ vials of slow-moving oils, I spilled the sucker everywhere. And I don't like it. It's something about the pit fruit combo; it smells cheap and plastic-y, over-ripe veering toward rotten, and with a urine note. And despite spilling a good deal of it I can hardly smell it once it dries. I really wanted to experience that waffle cone. \n\n**Monastic** (EDP - 2.5ml sprayer) *- Frankincense, fog, rose, myrrh, labdanum, spikenard, dust.*\n\nThoughts - This is super duper strong! The first spray is very... I'm not positive on this, I'm still learning to differentiate my incenses...  licorice-like, but not quite? Maybe fog + myrrh. As it settles it brightens to lemon (the frankincense, probably) and then I get rose coming through. The drydown reminds me of the \"vintage armoire\" accord from Thin Wild Mercury's Chateau which I don't really care for. And this is where things take a sharp turn downhill for my nose. I wouldn't call it cloying necessarily, but it's like a smoky, syrupy-sweet synthetic laquer on top of sour wood. If I had to guess, it's the spikenard. Maybe the fog? Could be the labdanum? I've sampled a decent amount of fragrance containing labdanum and I haven't picked up on this smell before, though. This is the sharp version of Travelers; see below. I could've sworn I liked frankincense but I don't like this and I don't care for Travelers either, and that's their common note. So after coming back to this later the dry down is turning my stomach. Scrubber alert. I’m really bummed because I wanted to love this one. (Of course the one I strongly dislike is so strong I had to wash twice with soap AND swab with alcohol.\n\n**Travelers** (EDP - 2.5ml sprayer) - *Amber, Clove, Frankincense* \n\nThoughts - Immediate sweet and warm amber, no immediate spice from the clove. It takes a minute to show up but it's smooth when it does. Surprising since clove is usually loud as hell and takes over. I don't really smell the frankincense outright, it's more of an overall hint of it. This disappears really fast. Update, it dries down as a softer version of Monastic and I don't like it. Ugh! \n\n\\*I'd love to know if you've tried these two and what you think!\\*",

I have a couple random samples (**Black Cat** and **Incense & Spidersilk**) that hit me in the face with incense while sniffing the bottles, I've been too scared to try them on skin in the heat of the summer haha.

        "body": "Popping in again, briefly, because I read a lot of folks talking about resting them/aging them & then my brain actually put two n two together, lol.\n\nSo there's this thing called Macerating / Maceration in perfumery that is *basically* resting the perfume for at least a month after it's been blended so that all the accords can meld together & the scent of alcohol (or whatever carrier being used) dissipates, amongst other things. Part of me wonders if some of these indie houses are blending their perfume bases with their carriers more recently before shipping them out and that's why the perfumes require a longer resting period upon arrival? Temperatures and jostling in the mail do *also* make a difference, of course, but perhaps it's also just that some of the blends require a longer period to macerate? 🤔 In that case, letting them rest a bit longer could help to smooth out some of the funky notes you're getting. If not, it could def just be skin chem too. \n\n& yeah aging does tend to soften some edges & change/make some top notes disappear which is why scents seem to get warmer and deeper. I definitely agree with aging some perfumes though, if they don't work right away. I'll be buying a FS bottle of Bewitched from BPAL soon just to hide it away for a couple years 'cause it doesn't work on me fresh. Only once it's aged a bit does the dark musk and vine-y notes of the berries come through.",

        "body": "All these reviews are interesting - whether positive or negative! It's absolutely useful to read people’s honest experiences and they can help us either way. Thanks for sharing yours. :)\n\nSolstice is a house I've had a very good hit rate with so far, and I seem to have amassed *quite* a few bottles, as well as a handful of samples. Funnily enough though, the majority (all but 6) you've covered here are ones I haven't tried!\n\nNot sure why, but I seem to have somehow avoided sampling pretty much all the SS incense/resin or amber scents (until I chucked Basilica into a 10-sample pack in my last order, and it's not one I plan to FS). It might simply be because I have quite a few which I love from those genres within my mainstream and niche stuff, so they’re  basically \"covered\" for me already. I also haven’t tried their more straight-floral ones for similar reasons.\n\nOf the 6 I've tried off your list, two of them I was interested to smell samples of, but wouldn't FS (**Basilica** was sort of underwhelming & **Coquina** is a kind of beach-skin scent which, while pleasant enough, I already have several of that I love). Two I blind FS’d and quite enjoy (**Iced Nectar** was nice & **High Desert** was an interesting, herbal blend with arid landscape - I like wearing it when watching films or shows set in a similar environment). One I sampled then FS'd (**Victorian Picnic** which I find quite friendly and pretty). Unfortunately with **Farmhouse in Spring** (also in my recent 10pk of samples) I picked up an undercurrent of surprisingly-realistic-horse-stable (or \\*something\\* a bit fecal) lurking  in there, which stuck around for a good portion of the wear, so yeeeah, that was a definite no for me. (Though I salute the commitment to atmospheric realism!) Having said that - whatever it was I was getting - it’s *not* in the other Farmhouse ones I own. **Farmhouse in Fall** is one of my fave cool weather scents and I also enjoy **Farmhouse in Winter**. I want to check out the summer version next.\n\nFor me so far, some of their best stuff has been the gourmand-atmospherics and straight atmospherics (as well as a few flourmands and a couple of more straight-gourmands). It’s possible the dry/desert/mineral atmospherics might be a bit more challenging than the foresty ones? While not wanting you to throw money away needlessly - since it may be true the house isn't for you - their catalogue is pretty huge, so it might pay not to give up on SS quite yet (at least until you've tried a few more). You might even be able to find an affordable bundle of mixed SS samples in the IMAM swap/sale thread too. There still may be plenty in the range which would ring your bell, depending on what you’re after.",

        "body": "Okay, so, I don't think I've tried any of the Solstice frags you just reviewed so I can't give my feedback on *that*.\n\n*But* I can say a few things about the spice notes.\n\nDepending on whether they're using botanical oils (essential oils, absolutes, resinoids, etc) or they're building the accords from aroma chemicals, the safe usage rates on skin are different. So if, say, Alkemia is building the accords and Solstice is using botanicals, the safe usage rate for skin contact with *clove* in particular is like... 0.005% of the entire composition (that's a quarter of a ml for every 50ml of perfume). \n\nSome perfumers don't adhere completely to those safe usage rates... but some do. And as I said, some build their own accord for clove & other spice notes & that can help them avoid that issue altogether. So. 😅 That's my lil 2 cents.\n\nAlso! Spikenard smells super earthy so I don't think that's what you're picking up in Monastic. My best guess, again as someone who hasn't sniffed that particular scent, is that it might be the labdanum + some part of the dust or fog accords? Labdanum has a dark kinda sticky scent to it that can lean a little smoke-like depending on where it's coming from.",

In just about every aisle, from dairy to frozen foods and snacks, you will see vegetable oils making repeated appearances on many product labels, including salad dressings, canned fish, ready-to-eat foods, diet drinks and infant formulas.\n\nThese oils, usually made from seeds, include sunflower, corn, rapeseed, soy, cottonseed and safflower oils.\n\nVegetable oil is a global industry. It generated more than £91 billion in 2020, and that figure is forecast to increase to £127 billion by 2027.\n\nRoughly a third of the calories in your diet likely comes from this substance, which has effects on our metabolism that medical science knows little about. The reason why human health is increasingly in crisis is right there on the label, hidden in plain sight.\n\nI'm a doctor with biochemistry training who specialises in family medicine, and I am convinced that these oils will make you sick (if they haven't already).\n\nThe amount of cancer-causing toxins found in a serving of French fries is equivalent to those consumed when smoking up to 25 cigarettes. (A 5oz serving has about 25 fries, so eating one chip gives the same exposure as smoking one cigarette)\n\nThe link between vegetable oil and poor health is firmly grounded and backed up with hard scientific research. Removing it from our diets can resolve fast-proliferating modern health plagues, such as cancers, [Alzheimer's](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html) and Parkinson's disease.\n\nVegetable oil is an industrial product that didn't exist until a little more than 150 years ago. In the millennia before industrial agriculture changed our landscape, many human populations relied on animal fats such as butter, beef fat and pork fat.\n\nHumanity has been eating animal fats since the Stone Age, and dairy fat for nearly 10,000 years. We've also eaten oils extracted from fatty fruits such as olives and coconuts for many thousands of years.\n\nBut vegetable oils are radically different. Making them requires technologically advanced equipment rather than a simple stone press, butter churn or butcher's knife.\n\nYet despite the complexity of processing these products, they are now the largest single source of dietary fats, accounting for more calories in our diets than sugar or flour.\n\nHeating oils creates toxins\n\nA basic problem with these oils is that they are very high in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). These compounds are very prone to reacting with oxygen — a process called oxidation.\n\nThis oil oxidation creates new compounds called, collectively, lipid oxidation products (LOPs).\n\nLOPs don't exist in the plants these products came from — and many are mildly to extremely toxic. By consuming these oils we're exposing our bodies to hundreds, even thousands, of different types of toxic LOPs.\n\nSome of these were almost unknown until recently, when they were identified thanks to new technologies.\n\nThese toxic LOPs are formed when the oil is extracted during its manufacture.\n\nStill more toxic LOPs can form in oil during storage, as the oil oxidises (breaks down) over time.\n\nToxicologists who perform real-world tests on vegetable oils in people's homes and restaurants find that even before cooking, the oils contain significantly higher concentrations of toxins than when they were first bottled.\n\nEven more toxins form when the oil is heated to make food, whether in our homes, in restaurants, or in processed-food factories.\n\nAnd yet more toxins will form if the food gets heated again, as in when leftovers are warmed up. There are volumes of academic textbooks that describe all the toxins you expose yourself to from eating foods made with vegetable oils.\n\nYet few people ever read these books or learn about the damning information they contain.\n\nNot all are toxic if heated\n\nMartin Grootveld, a professor of bioanalytical chemistry and chemical pathology at De Montfort University in Leicester, has been trying to warn consumers about toxins in vegetable oils for decades.\n\nHe studies oxidation reactions using the best tool for analysing an array of molecules all at once: a one and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscope. This machine can determine the make-up of a molecule by examining how its atoms spin when inside a magnetic field.\n\nThe toxins he has identified in vegetable oils include acrolein. This inflames lungs when inhaled, which we may do when frying with these oils. He has also found many members of a toxin category called epoxy fatty acids. These are implicated in breast [cancer](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/cancer/index.html), organ failure and [fertility](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/fertility/index.html) problems.\n\nProfessor Grootveld's analyses consistently show that heated vegetable oils are loaded with toxic LOPs.\n\nBy contrast, his experiments with heated coconut oil and butter find that they contain hardly any toxins at all.\n\nHowever, such is the medical ignorance of these dangers that when I asked Professor Grootveld if he'd ever been invited to present his data at a medical conference, he told me he had not.\n\nWhat's in those fries? \n\nAldehydes are perhaps the most dangerous category of the many families of toxins in vegetable oils. This family of chemicals includes the cadaver preservative formaldehyde and many of the toxins that make cigarette smoke carcinogenic and irritating to human tissue.\n\nToxic aldehydes that form in frying oil can end up in the food.\n\nIn 2019, Professor Grootveld led research, published in the prestigious journal Nature, which found that a 5oz serving of French fries cooked in vegetable oil (from a well-known franchise) contained 25 times more carcinogenic aldehydes than the [World Health Organisation](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/world-health-organization/index.html)'s tolerable upper limit for exposure.\n\nProfessor Grootveld told me that the amount of cancer-causing aldehydes he found in the serving of French fries is equivalent to those consumed when smoking up to 25 cigarettes. (A 5oz serving has about 25 fries, so eating one chip gives the same exposure as smoking one cigarette.)\n\nDeep-frying leads to more toxins\n\nThe level of damage done to polyunsaturated oils by oxidation follows the same basic principles as burns on your skin: it depends on time and temperature.\n\nExperts warn that the longer the oil is cooked and the higher the cooking temperature, the more toxins will form.\n\nEric Decker, a professor of food science at the University of [Massachusetts](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/massachusetts/index.html) Amherst in the U.S., is one of the most highly cited scientists in agriculture.\n\nHe focuses on preventing oxidation in our food supply, and told me that when it comes to toxin production, 'the biggest risk factor is deep-frying the oil'.\n\nDeep-frying stresses oils for a long time at high temperatures. Fast-food chains often have rules that tell employees to reduce toxicity by changing the frying oil once a week. Smaller eateries and chains may not.\n\nRoughly a third of the calories in your diet likely comes from vegetable oil, which has effects on our metabolism that medical science knows little about\n\n...But pan-frying is a close second \n\nA report in the American Journal of Epidemiology in 2000 identified an alarmingly high rate of lung cancer in non-smoking women who use vegetable oils during pan-frying, deep-frying and stir-frying, both in food service settings and their own homes.\n\nMany people know deep-frying is not healthy and avoid deep-fried foods. That's why Professor Grootveld is more concerned about shallow-frying food in pans using vegetable oils.\n\nHe has published several papers in various prestigious journals, including a 2019 paper in Scientific Reports warning that you can generate the same 'extremely high levels of hazardous aldehydes' while making popular pan-fried dishes at home.\n\nSo it's not just about deep-fried food, and it's not just about restaurants. This could be happening in your kitchen.\n\nBody fat becomes like veg oil\n\nDr Stephan Guyenet is an independent neuroscientist who has investigated what our increasing consumption of vegetable oils is doing to our body fat.\n\nIn the journal Advances in Nutrition in 2015 he published a review of 50 years of studies on the composition of Westerners' body fat.\n\nThis showed that the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids in it had gradually increased from 9.1 per cent of all fatty acids to 21.5 per cent. This was in line with increasing public consumption of vegetable oils. The lesson was clear: the more vegetable oil people ate, the more their body fat started to look like vegetable oil.\n\nOur reformulated body fat causes a fundamental shift in our body chemistry. This subjects our cells and tissues to a chemical imbalance called oxidative stress.\n\nOxidative stress unleashes carcinogenic toxins in cells that can damage proteins and DNA.\n\nIs there a link to Alzheimer's?\n\nIn 1906, German pathologist Alois Alzheimer examined slices of brain tissue from a woman who died of early-onset dementia. He found unusual clumps of protein, which he called amyloid plaques.\n\nBut the origin of the plaques eluded scientific explanation until U.S. and Japanese researchers reported that these plaques are caused by oxidative stress, in 2001 in the Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology. Their research showed that oxidative stress damages proteins, generating tiny blobs of cellular debris.\n\nOur brain cells have garbage-disposal systems that can clean up most types of debris. But not all — and not amyloid. The amyloid that the clean-up crew can't handle will accumulate within the cell, and eventually it starts forming amyloid plaques.\n\nThe accumulating plaque slows down cellular activity, which slows down the brain's processing speed — and that's when symptoms usually begin.\n\nMany degenerative disorders follow a similar progression.\n\nAnother common disease-inducing protein blob is oxidised alpha-synuclein, which causes Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia (the second most common dementia, after Alzheimer's).\n\nA study found that a 5oz serving of French fries cooked in vegetable oil contained 25 times more toxins than the World Health Organisation's tolerable upper limit for exposure\n\nHow to de-pufa your body\n\nWhile I have no doubt that we can get our PUFA levels back down to normal, it takes a while. One study, from 1960, showed that the half-life of PUFA in our body fat ranged from 350 to 750 days, which means it takes that long to clear out just half of it.\n\nMore recent studies, such as a report in the journal Cell Metabolism in 2011, pinpoint a similar figure: 580 days on average. So we're looking at three or four years of avoiding vegetable oils to normalise the amount of PUFAs in your body fat.\n\nHowever, from my experience with patients, the good news is that usually people feel better within a couple of weeks of cutting out vegetable oils, particularly if they suffer from chronic pain or stomach problems, because their bodies' inflammation levels will have dropped significantly.\n\nSo how do you know what to look for? Check the ingredients list of every product that has a nutrition label. Every. Single. One. Because you simply can't predict what will have vegetable oil in.\n\nYou might think that dried fruits, for example, wouldn't, but they do. Or peanut butter. Or nuts, rotisserie chicken, mayonnaise and dressings that say 'made with olive oil', granola, canned tuna, olives, sun-dried tomatoes and other vegetable preserves, even random things such as vitamins and spice blends.\n\nMost people who shun vegetable oils tend to use butter, olive oil and peanut oil. For home cooking with healthy oils, you need to choose the oil that matches the cuisine.\n\nI use olive oil for homemade pasta sauces and anything Italian, Mediterranean — or even Mexican (the traditional fat would be lard, which I can't easily get). I also use it for roasting vegetables and making dressings, marinades and mayonnaise. If you like to make Thai and Indian dishes, you might want to add coconut oil.\n\nHow to avoid these oils if eating out\n\nRestaurants take advantage of the fact that vegetable oils cost less than traditional fats and oils such as olive oil and butter.\n\nMany use vegetable oil in all deep-fried, pan-fried and batter-fried foods (including crispy noodles, onion rings, fried shrimp, chicken dishes and Japanese tempura). Restaurants love to serve deep-fried food because the process is so simple that you can hire staff without any culinary skills whatsoever.\n\nAvoiding deep-fried food is the number one rule for eating in restaurants and grabbing food out. Anything battered or breaded and fried is typically deep-fried — and in fast-food restaurants and many other establishments, it's often fried twice — once at the factory and a second time before it's served.\n\nMore than half of the calories in some deep-fried foods are in the form of the most oxidised and disease-inducing, heat-deformed vegetable oils.\n\nDishes that are baked or steamed instead are clearly preferable to anything that's fried.\n\nRestaurants also use vegetable oils in sauces traditionally made with butter or olive oil, including hollandaise sauce and aioli.\n\nMost salad dressings contain vegetable oil in place of olive oil or cream. (Any restaurant dish that contains mayonnaise will likely contain vegetable oil, since it is rarely made with olive oil.)\n\nVegetable oils are also baked into doughnuts, Danish pastries, muffins and numerous other desserts and confections.\n\nMy 'hateful eight' oils to avoid \n\n* Corn oil\n* Rapeseed oil\n* Sunflower oil\n* Soy oil\n* Cottonseed oil\n* Safflower oil\n* Grapeseed oil\n* Rice bran oil\n\nMy 'delightful dozen' good fats\n\n* Butter/ghee\n* Extra-virgin olive oil or unfiltered refined olive oil\n* Unrefined peanut oil\n* Unrefined coconut oil\n* Unrefined avocado oil\n* Sesame oil\n* Unrefined palm oil\n* Bacon fat\n* Tallow\n* Lard\n* Chicken fat\n* Unrefined tree nut oils (almond, hazelnut, pecan, etc.)\n\nWhat about refined versions of peanut oil, for example? These oils are not nourishing, but they're not as bad as my Hateful Eight, so fall into a middle category of 'OK but not great'.\n\nYou don't need to avoid them, but if a more nutritious alternative is available I'd recommend that instead.\n\nSome people worry about 'smoke point' — this is a term used by the oil industry to sell lower-quality, refined oils, which always have higher smoke points than their extra-virgin (i.e. unrefined) counterparts.\n\nThese lower-quality oils also have fewer antioxidants, which means they oxidise at lower temperatures than higher-quality oils, so your food will contain more toxins.\n\nSmoke point simply refers to the temperature at which a fat starts to smoke. It doesn't tell you what you really need to know, which is whether the oil is oxidising or not (only toxicology testing can tell you that).\n\nAt the smoke point, you might see a wisp of light blue smoke, and heating the fat past that point will fill the air with bitter smoke and ruin the food.\n\nAn oil with a high smoke point allows for higher heat and faster cooking, which makes things go quicker in a busy restaurant. But when your high smoke-point oil is also refined and high in polyunsaturates, you're exchanging speed for toxicity.\n\nThe suggestion is that using an oil with a higher smoke point preserves the food's flavour. But a high smoke-point oil doesn't do that.\n\nWhat does? Using normal cooking techniques such as stirring and turning down the heat. Most foods should not be cooked at super-high temperatures anyway, because heat also destroys the nutrition in the food: the higher you heat something, the less nutritious it becomes.\n\nAdapted from Dark Calories: How Vegetable Oils Destroy Our Health And How We Can Get It Back, by Dr Catherine Shanahan (Orion Publishing, £18.99), to be published on June 13.

I know that The Morbid the Merrier (Sugar and Spite's previous incarnation) used sweet almond oil as their carrier oil, and my bottles from them went rancid within a couple of years. I was happy to see her switch to a different base for Sugar and Spite. \n\nI recently looked into what BPAL uses for their base oils, and the answer seemed to be that they don't use a base, they use attars. I'm not entirely sure what this entails, but I've never had a BPAL go bad on me (gradually lose top notes, yes). They also have good throw/longevity for me. Does anyone know what NAVA uses?

I've swatched a few Innisfree, EH and Aritaum ones and while they are pretty good value, I just seem to prefer the ones I have from Sleek, Isadora (MAC, UD and Lorac are apples and oranges to most AB shadows). I am curious on VDL Pantone palettes but sadly they're a bit difficult to get ahold of. \n\n\nI also liked my Body Shop Camomile cleansing oil better than my TFS Rice Bran oil. I felt I didn't need to use as much to get rid of the same amount of make up. For TFS, I feel like I really have to put a little more effort to rub off the remnants, esp for eyes.",

The non-reactive storage container is good too.\n\nWhile rendering, add some herbs (antioxidants) to protect the oil from oxidation. I use cotton tea bags filled with meat specific traditional herb mixtures. As the meat renders, I'll pop out spent tea bags and add fresh ones. Surprisingly, the oil picks up less flavor from the herbs than you might expect. \n\nAs the last step with oil production, always return the filtered oil to a clean pan for the final thermal cycle to drive out all moisture. Any moisture in the oil can lead to lipid hydrolysis with production of free fatty acids. This final thermal cycle inactivates any remaining enzymes that promote lipid breakdown, off flavors, oxidation, and the formation of free fatty acids. I usually target around 260 275 F and watch for the moisture to finish bubbling off. Maybe 5 to 15 minutes depending on how much moisture is in the oil. This final thermal cycle is absolutely critical when recovering oil from the surface of a bone broth, aka soup broth production.",

    "body": "I began researching indie brands at the beginning of 2020, but then really embraced scents, because the world can be an overwhelming and sad place sometimes, and on top of self-care, I want to smell nice while working my ass off and not leaving the house, dammit 😂\n\nJust as I really began to dive into indie perfumes, Death & Floral came on the scene, and I was excited to try a house that was “starting off” around the same time as me! I placed my order on 6/1 and received it on 6/22. Not bad in general, plus, you know, during a pandemic, close to their launch, etc.\n\nI’ll kick this off by saying that this isn’t a *negative* post, but that my reviews aren’t all positive. I love D&F’s aesthetic, Brim’s customer service is amazing (seriously … I asked a question via the website recently, and had an answer within like a minute!), and I look forward to trying more from this house and seeing what she comes up with (ESPECIALLY the customs – so exciting). That said, I think that my chemistry simply wasn’t vibing with some of these, and that’s okay – expecting every scent to be a hit is utterly unrealistic!\n\nI’d like to note that based on the timing of my order, it’s my understanding that the oils I received have a rice bran oil base, and that D&F has since switched to a fractionated coconut oil base. I won’t pretend to know enough about how that might impact the scents themselves, longevity, etc. 😊 Also, if you’re buying from D&F for the first time, YMMW, but I definitely recommend letting them rest before coming to a verdict. When I first tried all of these scents (maybe 3 days in), I’ll admit that I was disappointed, but around the 3 week-mark, they “bloomed.”\n\n**Method:**\n\n* I tried all of these scents within a few days of receiving them (on different days, using any part of my body that seemed reasonable) because I’m a greedy little monster. Then, after letting them sit for at least 2-3 weeks, I tried them again.\n* I kept each scent on for at least a half-day, unless otherwise indicated in my reviews.\n* My collection has been, uh, rapidly growing. Ha. Some of the scents I received have since been destashed. Popular indie houses I’ve sampled from, in order: Alkemia, Little Book Eater, Hexennacht, Death & Floral, Sixteen92, Arcana, Poesie, Strange Fire & Fumery, Solstice Scents, Firebird, Astrid, Nui Cobalt, Cocoa Pink, and NAVA.\n* Adding the disclaimer that I have a relatively \"new nose\" – I can pick some notes out, but I tend to describe perfumes like I describe food (i.e. OMG more; mmm, doughnut; BLECHHHH; etc.).\n\n**Summary**\n\n* **Keeping:** Nothing Rusts in the Desert; Two Cups of Tea; The Sweater We Buried You With\n* **Liked, but destashed:** Swamp Elixir; The Secret of Wives and Widows\n* **Get it off of me:** Lay Me in the Earth; I Was Born a Bitch, I Was Born a Painter\n\n**Nothing Rusts in the Desert:** *Pink cactus flowers and sweet grass with notes of warm rain and woody dry vanilla.* After letting this sit for \\~3 weeks, I was pleased with the results. This is a sweet summer drink, with just a touch of grass, wood, and rain. I hope that over time I get more of the woody, earthy notes that are described for this, but I still like it as is. Throw and longevity are pretty good. **Verdict**: I'll keep this one and enjoy it throughout the summer! **4/5**\n\n**Two Cups of Tea:** *Rain on cracked soil, wet creosote, a swelling monsoon, desert cedar, black tea.* This is another one that I'm really glad I let sit for \\~3 weeks. I like the tea and rain, and I'm getting more of the woody cedar now. **Verdict**: I don't know that I'll FS, but I'll enjoy the sample. **4/5**\n\n**The Sweater We Buried You With:** *A luscious blend of three different vanillas, resinous ambers, Arabian sandalwood, a soft cashmere sweater.* I really wanted to love this one, based on the description, but I was hoping for a bit more \"oomph\" / warmth to go along with the vanilla. **Verdict**: I like this enough to keep the sample, and because I'm honestly curious at this point to see if it develops further with age. **4/5** EDIT: I've more recently work Nothing Rusts and Two Cups of Tea, but questions led me to try this one again to make sure I could compare against others I own, and THERE'S that depth and warmth I was hoping for, 1.5 months in! I'm getting all of the sandalwood I was hoping for, and the cashmere finishing note. Lovely! \n\n**Swamp Elixir:** *Soft Honeysuckle and mossy oak trees blended with water lilies and sparkling pink lemonade.* This smells like straight up pink lemonade and honeysuckle to me, which I like, with just a tiny touch of green. This is a pretty straightforward scent, and it's pleasant, but not exactly what I was hoping for. Throw was decent, but my skin ate it up. **Verdict**: I liked this, but not enough to keep it. **3/5**\n\n**The Secret of Wives and Widows:** *A dark and mysterious blend of Arabian sandalwood, luscious vanilla, orchids and southern night air, white tea in a fine cup of China held by a figure with long painted nails.* This is very fresh. Wet, I get vanilla, sandalwood, and a touch of tea. Once it dries down, I get a lot more grass and earthy notes, which is nice. I wasn't really sure what to expect from this one. **Verdict**: I liked this, but not enough to keep it. **3/5**\n\n**I Was Born a Bitch, I Was Born a Painter:** *Sweet basil and violets blended with Spanish moss, yarrow oil, and blue musk.* Sharp AF in the bottle, and I'm really not sure why! It remained sharp on my skin, too. I have no idea if it was the basil (not what I'm used to from basil though), or maybe the yarrow? I ended up scrubbing this one off after \\~30 mins. **Verdict**: Not for me. **1/5**\n\n**Lay Me in the Earth:** *Milky baby deer skin, soft fur musk, warm earth, oak trees, floral forest floor moss.* I'll be honest … this one upset me a bit, which is a wild thing to say about perfume. Haha. At best, it smelt like baby wipes to me. At worst, a scented diaper (which btw, I sincerely hope is NOT a thing). I let it sit on my skin as long as I could stand (\\~30 mins), to see if it would develop, but no luck. **Verdict**: I’ve seen love for this one in other reviews, but it’s just not for me. **0/5**",

Maybe I am crazy, but I get two different coffee scents from the soap, both good, and **very good** together. The soap is tallow-based, but also includes rice bran oil, avocado oil, and apricot kernel oil. The soap lathers easily, with excellent slickness and glide. The lather is shiny and creamy and also feels lighter, less \"fat-heavy\", than some of the soaps I have used lately. Post shave is excellent, and the soap rinses off cleanly. *Very nice soap!* I really enjoyed my shaves all week - great stuff!\n\nThe aftershave is an alcohol-free splash with witch hazel as the primary ingredient. The scent is still very strong in the aftershave, with more of the cold brew scent to me, and the scent is short-lived. You need just a bit of the aftershave, and I was very pleasantly surprised at how good my skin felt after use. It dries down almost immediately, with no sticky or tacky feel, and my skin felt soft and supple. Recommended!\n\nThe Schick Injector is the closest thing I have to a cartridge razor in terms of the overall shave. Zero issues with blade control here: the blade is held perfectly in place and the angle makes for a very comfortable, if not very efficient, shave. I can fly through a shave with this razor and never feel that I am in any danger of razor burn or nicks. The blade seems to go and go, but I will have to find out later just how many shaves I can get out of this one. If you have never tried an Injector, you really should - beautiful shaves!!\n\n**If you read all this way**\n\nI have enjoyed the various posts detailing the ups and downs of 2017, and just wanted to thank all of you that had the courage to post your personal stories. For those of us that have had those really down years, it can be hard to be honest with others about just how shitty the year has been. Chin up, things get better...",

Storybook Soapworks can be purchased direct from their website or at  Maggard Razors ([www.maggardrazors.com](http://www.maggardrazors.com/)).\n\nWest Egg named for the city of the newly-rich from the Great Gatsby, is a whimsical scent featuring scent notes of: white grapes and sparkling aldehydes. The culmination of these notes represents the smell of champagne. To my nose, this is an accurate recreation of the bubbly drink that signifies celebration. The scent is vibrant and fun, it is approachable and feels almost unisex for use. Mrs. Ruds likes the scent. While she does not find it sexy or masculine, she approves of casual ring. Strength of scent is mid out of the soap tub and remains this way once lathered. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends the Chatillon Lux eau de parfum as a complimentary scent profile.\n\nStorybook Soapworks uses a tallow based soap featuring listed ingredients of: Stearic Acid, Water, Beef Tallow, Potassium Hydroxide, Castor Oil, Coconut Oil, Fragrance, Shea Butter, Vegetable Glycerin, Rice Bran Oil, Avocado Oil, Apricot Kernel Oil, Sodium Lactate, Tocopherol. The soap is soft and therefore care should be taken to ensure it is not overloaded. The soap is of above average thirst, but not the thirstiest soap out there. When properly hydrated and dialed in, the resulting lather will display the consistency of sour cream. Both primary and residual slickness are very good. While short of the upper tier soaps in terms of slickness, it gets the job done without any problems. Post shave is protective and nourishing to the skin. The post shave, like the slickness is very good. Storybook Soapworks soap base is more than a serviceable base in terms of performance and as such receives a ShaveScore of 88. For similar performance in a soap base, I suggest: Purely Skinful Handmade Essentials and Stubble Buster.\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Storybook Soapworks West Egg (loaner)\n* Brush - DS Cosmetics “Gel Tip” (promotional gift)\n* Razor - Boker “Elite” (gift)\n* Post - Chatillon Lux West Egg (loaner)",

    "body": "Hello! My first foray into indie perfumes was about a year or so ago with Firebird and a little bit of Death and Floral. This is my first time really wanting to explore more scents and I made a small set of orders in February! Pretty much all of the full sizes were blind buys after reading some reviews, but overall I had a good experience. I'm still new to picking out individual notes and finding what works for me, but I'll try my best to describe everything\\~ \n\n\\-\n\n**Death and Floral 'That First Morning Moment' - 5mL, rested 3 weeks**\n\n*Cozy blend of lavender and chamomile tea, with notes of white amber and soft cotton.*\n\nThis one honestly made me so sad. I got a full size of this one because I loved the sample I had in the old rice bran oil, but in the new FCO I can't really smell any of the notes at all. Both in the bottle and on skin I'm getting a bit of plasticky smell with what is kind of like brown sugar? But nothing like what my sample smells like. I've heard that some D&F scents need many months of aging/resting before they really transform into what they're supposed to be, so I'm hoping that's what happens with this bottle I have 😭 Brim was really kind and sent me a replacement bottle as well in case the first one was a dud, so I'll report back here in a week or so with an edit of how that one does.\n\nEdit 3/27/21: unfortunately it seems like the second bottle is also turning out the same as the first :( I’m gonna stash both away for a while and hope the notes develop after a few months!\n\nThe actual scent in the original rice bran oil is really lovely though, it's clean and cozy and the perfect 'my skin but better' scent for me. I really liked this layered with my sample of 'Half Hoping to be Eaten by a Bear'. I heard you can request for scents to be made in the rice bran carrier instead of FCO, so I might do that for some of the older scents I want to FS in the future after trying samples through Ajevie.\n\n**Death and Floral 'Macarons & Roses' - 5mL, rested 3 weeks**\n\n*Sugar’d rose macarons with a light raspberry & strawberry cream filling.*\n\nIn the bottle, this smells just like rose milk tea to me, which I really love! On my skin it's really rosey and sugary, almost overwhelmingly sweet but just shy of being so. I think the cream filling is what's giving me the milk tea vibe. I don't really get any of the berry notes on my skin, but that's okay. After a couple hours, the sugar is less overwhelming and I'm left with a soft, sweet rose scent and the sugar is more like powdered sugar.\n\n**Astrid 'Red' - 8mL, rested 2 weeks**\n\n*Lychee, red pear, rose absolute, blood orange, dragons blood, and red skin apples.*\n\nTo be honest, I mostly got this one because of the lychee note, but I can't really pick it out on myself! The scent is still pretty great though. In the bottle, I get a really strong apple scent that's also a bit citrusy. On my skin, it's a well-blended fruit punch that's pleasant but I can't pick out any individual fruits. A while later, it's a slightly sweeter fruit scent with more of the rose shining through. \n\n**Astrid 'As All the Colors Soften' - 8mL, rested 2 weeks**\n\n*Vanillaed wood accord, oakmoss, violet leaf, lavender absolute, and fossilized amber.*\n\nWowowow. This one was really lovely and complex! In the bottle it smells clean, green, and leafy. On the skin it starts out being woody, leafy, and definitely reminds me of winter. Over time, though, the vegetation gives way to the vanilla wood and is really cozy. I've heard many great things about Astrid's blending in her perfumes and I think this one really shows it!\n\n**Astrid 'Red Bramble Wood' - 1mL sample, rested 2 weeks**\n\n*Twisted and knotty wood, blackberry, raspberry, agarwood, tonka bean, vanilla bean, and clove.*\n\nIn the bottle I smell berries and wood, and a little dampness. On the skin it's berry and woody again, but gives way to a warmth that I think is the tonka, vanilla, and clove. Where 'As All the Colors Soften' reminds me of winter, I think 'Red Bramble Wood' would be really great for fall.\n\n**Astrid 'Nature Morte' - 1mL sample, rested 2 weeks**\n\n*Black currant, hay absolute.*\n\nIn the bottle and on the skin, I get a really strong berry smell and not much of the hay. It's different from the berries in 'Red Bramble Wood', a little sweet and sour. I think this might be nice for layering if I wanted to add a berry scent to my other perfumes.\n\n**Stereoplasm 'Kindling' - 4.5mL, rested 1 week**\n\n*Sweet jasmine incense, sunset musk, fresh sativa and strawberry wine.*\n\nThis scent is easily my favorite out of everything in this bunch! In the bottle it smells like strawberry candy and a bit of greenness. On the skin, it starts off as a juicy candied strawberry, with heaviness that I think is the jasmine incense and some greenness floating throughout. After three or so hours, the strawberries have faded and I'm left with a soft, musky jasmine smell. I usually don't tend toward fruity scents because I'm afraid they'll be too sweet, but I really loved how the strawberry is really grounded by the other notes in this one and it makes me want to look more into fruity green scents. \n\n**Stereoplasm 'Metal Ox' - 1.75mL, rested 1 week**\n\n*Blue moon musk, frozen lichen, juniper and tiny bells of lily.*\n\nIt's the year of the metal ox, and I think this scent really embodies the 'metal' part! This one is kind of hard for me to describe because it's so unlike anything I've tried before. Wet and in the bottle, it has a sharp, metallic smell that's also kind of aquatic. On my skin, I definitely still get that metallic feel but it's a little more subdued and complex. It makes me feel like I'm standing in a cold, damp cave with sheets of metal here and there. I would say the scent isn't unpleasant, but it's not something I'd normally wear.\n\nOn a side note, I really like the little reducer lid with the flip top that sits on the bottle under the screw-on lid! I'd love to find something like that for Astrid's bottles.\n\n**Stereoplasm 'Scrumptious Sagittarius' - 1.8mL sample, rested 1 week**\n\n*A delicious gingerbread cookie, baked with scintillating spoonfuls of cinnamon, nutmeg and molasses, paired with a refreshing bowl of ripe blueberries.*\n\nIn the bottle, it smells just like gingerbread. On my skin, it starts off with the yummy gingerbread but quickly gives way to the cinnamon. I think I might amp cinnamon, because it's all I could smell from it for a while. After a few hours, some sweetness peeks back through, which I think is the molasses or the blueberries. I don't know if I'll be wearing this one much because the cinnamon is so strong on me, but I think this would be great in candle form!\n\n**Stereoplasm 'Salacious Snail' - 1.8mL sample, rested 1 week**\n\n*Dew on canopy leaves, forest moss, bleeding hearts, androgynous musk and sea salt.*\n\nThis one smells really clean and green. In the bottle it smells almost soapy to me, but not in a bad way. On the skin there's a little bit of soapiness still, with what I think is the canopy leaves and forest moss. Eventually, I do smell what seems to be the sea salt peeking through. It feels like I'm sitting on a bed of wet leaves on the forest floor with salty air on my skin.",

    "body": "Pictures [here](https://imgur.com/a/2CUXH) \n\nDisclaimer: I've never done reviews before so please bear with me :p. Also, I realize it's not exactly a mini review but I'm not apologizing! \n\nI've only been using this cream for less than a week so I'll just talk about my initial thoughts on it. \n\n* Packaging:\nRed, fancy box plastered with Japanese. All I know is i) the pharmacy in Japan had a shelf full of it so it must be a big deal: ii) the red box caught my eye: iii) it was LuLuLun: iv) the box had serious-looking skin diagrams that looked serious: v) my husband's roaming data wasn't working so good bye, Google Translate: and vi) what the hell, it was cheap (¥1,800).\n\nThe cream itself comes in a really pretty, frosted glass jar with a matte, gold aluminum lid embossed with the LuLuLun logo. Reminds me of magazine-style shabby chic and Pinterest projects. Seriously, the jar is so pretty I would've bought more just for the packaging. \n\n* Smell:\nVery, very relaxing. It has a very light, floral scent with hints of soap (but not in a bad way). I honestly don't know how to describe the smell, just that it's quite addicting and makes me feel nostalgic, like I'm a kid playing the piano with my grandma all over again. That doesn't mean the cream smells like grandmothers, but it's just a homey, floral smell. \n\n*Texture:\nIt has a thick, slightly translucent, slippery consistency, reminiscent of buttercream. It holds its shape in the jar but I have a hard time scooping some out with my finger since it keeps slipping out. (Which reminds me, mine didn't come with a spatula, but I always wash my hands before I touch my creams, I'm not a barbarian.)\n\n*Absorbency/Performance:\nFor a thick cream, it's surprisingly light and absorbent. A few rubs here and a few pats there and it's gone. It doesn't leave my face greasy/heavy but gives it a moist, satin sheen that's slightly dry to the touch, if that makes sense. Leaves my skin cool too, which could be due to a higher water content. \n\nIt's very spreadable as well, so less is more. \n\n*Results:\nI only use this at night so I can only comment on the overnight effects. It doesn't give me The Glow™ but I noticed that my face isn't as greasy as it usually is in the morning. In fact, I had the same satiny sheen I had the night before. With just a splash of water, I can imagine my face getting through the day with the residue from last night's application. \n\nI live in a tropical country and  have oily skin so I haven't used it yet during the daytime. However, for those lucky (or unlucky) enough to go through winter, this might make a great addition to your AM routine as it adds deep hydration without textural issues getting in the way of makeup. \n\nSummary: It's a good, no-frills moisturizer. (For the price and the deep hydration it gives, I recommend it to everyone. \n\n(Apologies for the lack of an ingredient list since it's nowhere to be found, but it seems to have yeast cell wall extract, rice bran oil extract, emollient oil, and aloe Vera.) \n\ntl:dr: It's really not that long.

    "body": "Hello! Good morning, & how do you all do?\n\nToday I am going to be delving into skincare! In particular, the indie skincare brand, **Chikyu**. You can find the storefront on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Chikyu?ref=simple-shop-header-name&listing_id=572367388) as well as a personal business [website](https://chikyuskincare.com/). For thorough information about each ingredient & benefits please check the site listings. I haven’t even made a dent in the items I want to try from the catalog, but I feel as if I have acquired enough product (purchasing & through generous samples) that it was time to do reviews. Be prepared for a rave fest! Also I might break this up in different posts, to keep it from being a slog of reading.\n\nTAT was incredibly swift. The packaging is *the most* thoughtfully packaged item I have ordered from a skincare company. Everything was wrapped so delicately in tissue paper & securely, all secured with a beautiful knotted silky type rope. I have ordered three times now, & there has been a generous amount of sizable samples included each time! Before I even get into the quality of the product itself, I have to mention the quality of the containers & labeling. Absolutely as if you were ordering from a high end, big brand, but in my humble opinion, better than that! \n\nAbout my skincare, if it is of any use. As I have gotten older, my skin requirements have started to change, & I now consider myself in the mature skin category. I can get a mild breakout from time to time if I am on my cycle & irritate my skin at the same time, but it is not as sensitive as it was in my twenties. I do require products that are heavier in terms of moisturizing, & probably have for a while now without realizing it. My main issues are sebaceous filaments, milia on my cheeks, hyperpigmentation, & dry patches. Wrinkles I don’t see as an issue, just a part of aging, although I do want to be proactive at not accelerating them any quicker than need be.\n\nNow let the reviewing commence!!\n\n# Utsukushii “INDIGO Elixir” – Fortifying Night Oil\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\n1oz (Full Size)\n\n.25ml (Trial Size/Miniature)\n\n1.5ml (Sample)\n\nIngredients: Rice Bran Oil, \\*Tsubaki (Camellia) Seed Oil, Olive Squalane, Papaya Oil, Shiso-Yo (Japanese Perilla Oil), \\*White Chia Oil,\\*Coconut Oil, \\*Jojoba Oil, , Blue Tansy, Jasminum Sambac, Vitamin E, Poris Cocos Mushroom, Marine Algae, Rice Ferment Peptides, Hyaluronic Acid, Pseudocollagen,\n\nAlright folks. This is *the* product that drew me into this brand in the first place. I had been searching for some time, for a blue tansy face serum or a balm. After some deliberation & searching this subreddit for past reviews, I actually found a raving review on this exact product & with communication from the OP I was confident in going in on a FS.\n\nAs you will find out with a lot of the products, this one is a staple in my routine now. The FS comes in a beautiful, quality glass dropper style bottle. The serum goes a long way, & while it feels very moisturizing, it is lightweight & sinks into the skin fairly quickly. The smell is slightly earthy, which I enjoy. It has a very soothing quality & it does not just sit on top of the face. I was worried about the coconut oil, but I am almost done with my first FS bottle (heavy handed use) & I have not had any adverse reactions to it. I do find that my hair tends to absorb the oils at night, but actually I feel as if it has been helping my dry hair so win/win! I apply this only at night, right after a bukachoil serum from another store. I recommend trying sample sizes or a trial size before committing to a FS though, because I did find I have a preference between three of the serums I have tried.\n\n# Indigo (Silk) Face Cream\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\n30ml/1oz (Full Size)\n\n7.4ml/.25oz (Trial/Miniature Size)\n\n1.5ml (Sample Size/Skin Tester)\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\n\\*Calendula Hydrosol, Marula Oil, Prickly Pear Oil, \\*Grapeseed Oil, Sesame Seed Oil, \\*Calendula Oil, \\*Rose Hip Oil, \\*Aloe Leaf, \\*Coconut Oil, Avocado Oil, Jojoba Oil, Witch Hazel, Sunflower Seed Oil, \\*White Willow Bark, \\*Neem Oil, Pseudocollagen, Hyaluronic Acid, Phyto Peptide Complex (Plant Based Peptides), Silk Amino Peptides, Blue Tansy (Moroccan Chamomile ESO), Klamath Blue Algae, Caprylic Triglyceride (Coconut based), Stearic Acid (Plant Sourced), Cetyl Alcohol, Xanthan Gum, Palmarosa Oil, May Chang fruit oil, Benzoin Resin oil, Cedarwood Bark Oil. Magnesium, NonGMO Soybean Germ Extract.\\*Rosemary ESO, Vitamin E, \\*Vegetable Glycerin, Radish Root ESO\n\nI had originally received this as a sample in my first order & ended up ordering a FS. I usually use a different brand of face moisturizer that I honestly prefer over this one. Although for reasons unknown to me, the shop never followed through with shipping out of my order & even though there were communications with the other shop owner, I still don’t know if I am getting my package or a refund as informed. Either way, with that in mind, I ordered a FS of this because as a replacement, this one fits the bill nicely & Chikyu is always extremely reliable. It doesn’t feel as moisturizing as my preferred, but it also doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry by any means. It isn’t greasy & absorbs fairly quickly. The size is in my opinion slightly smaller than I had imagined, but a little really does go a long way, especially if you are also using her other products. The container is quality glass like her other FS products. I think the price is reasonable though, because this one is packed full of vastly more beneficial ingredients comparatively. So I would definitely recommend this to someone who doesn’t like a heavy moisturizer. There is a mushroom moisturizer that I am more interested in trying, so before I finish this container, I will order a sample of that one to see if it is better suited for me. Until then I will continue to use this product.\n\n# Hakumai Mizu “Rice/Pearl” Face Cleanser\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\nSize: 1oz (Trial/Travel Size)\n\n4oz (Full Size Glass Jar with Bamboo Fibers)\n\n4oz (Full Size Glass Jar without Bamboo Fibers)\n\nINGREDIENTS: Fermented Rice Water\\*, Coconut Oil\\*, Lavender Flower Extract\\*, Rose Hip Oil, Castor Oil, Rice Bran Oil, Matsutake Mushroom Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple Fruit Essence), Wild Burdock Root Extract\\*, Crushed Pearl Powder, Rice Ferment Peptides, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Bamboo Fibers, \\*Grey Sea Salt, Glucose (Sugar Based), Vitamin C, Vegetable Glycerin\\*, Sake, Stearic Acid (Plant Derived), Cetyl Alcohol, Guar Gum, NataPres (Radish Root, Honeysuckle, Aspen Bark).\n\nI had also originally received a sample of this & ended up FS. I really love this cleanser. The sample does not come with the option for the bamboo fibers, & when I ordered a larger size I opted for the bamboo fibers. This is an extremely sizeable glass container for how little you need to use. It has a pearlescent sheen to it that is extremely beautiful. The bamboo fibers are delicate, but abrasive enough to scrub the skin without having to apply much pressure on your face when rubbing it in. I did notice that using this alone as a cleanser left my skin feeling stripped more than I would like. So with that in mind the next product I will review compliments this one. This is definitely a staple, but I am very curious about her other cleansers & plan on sampling the others to see if I have a preference. I am especially interested in the Matcha Cleanser.\n\n# Facial Cleansing Oil\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\nSize: 4oz (Full Size)\n\n1oz (Trial/Travel Size)\n\nINGREDIENTS: \\*Meadowfoam Oil, \\*Camellia Oil, \\*Grapeseed Oil, Castor Oil, \\*Rose Geranium ESO, Multifruit BSC\n\nI love this cleansing oil. This is admittedly my first foray into double cleansing & boy do I feel like a dingus for not having done this before! In my opinion, if you use the rice/pearl cleanser, this one is a must to use beforehand. I have noticed with consistent use, that my face is left feeling more moisturized & better cleansed than if I had just used the other alone. A little goes a long way, the FS is a glass pump container that is sizeable. No matter what cleanser I use, I will always have this in my routine. The smell is delicate, & does not irritate my skin whatsoever. I highly recommend trying a sample of this product. The sample I originally ordered was enough to carry me through three weeks of heavy handed use. I have no plans on looking for another cleansing oil. I will continue to use this as long as Lyn sells it!\n\n# Kagayakimasu “GLOW” Face Elixir\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\n1oz (Full Size)\n\n.25ml (Trial Size/Miniature)\n\n1.5ml (Sample)\n\nINGREDIENTS: \\*Watermelon Oil, \\*Cucumber Seed Oil, Rosehip Seed Oil, \\*Olive Oil, \\*Hemp Seed Oil, Sea Buckthorn Oil, \\*Tsubaki (Camellia) Seed Oil, \\*Jojoba Oil, \\*Tamanu Oil, Wheat Germ Oil,Geranium ESO, Lavender ESO, Grapefruit ESO, Pseudocollagen\n\nThe sample size container reminds me of my previous career in histopathology working with antibodies in immunohistochemistry. It’s a little flip top, sturdy, plastic container, but isn’t flat on the bottom. Something you would have in a rack while you pipette. Alright, I wanted to love this one. It smells absolutely gorgeous! But it felt way too heavy on my face, almost greasy. I am glad I only ordered a sample size of this, because I did start getting some clogged pores & small breakouts on my chin & forehead after using this one. I will mention that I had started my cycle right after trying this one, so that really could have been the culprit, but my face didn’t feel as irritated after I stopped using it. I just don’t feel like this one is for me & that is ok! I believe it is well loved by others here & obviously on her multiple reviews on both store sites. I plan on using up the sample on my décolletage‬ area & hands. \n\n# Liquid Moisture\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\n1oz (Full Size)\n\n.25ml (Trial Size/Miniature)\n\n1.5ml (Sample)\n\nINGREDIENTS: Cranberry Seed Oil, Pomegranate Seed Oil, Marula Oil, Baobab Oil, \\*Pumpkin Seed Oil, \\*Borage Oil, \\*Grapeseed Oil, Jojoba Oil, Neroli ESO, Jasmine Grandiflorum Absolute, Jasmine Flowers, Pseudocollegen\n\nI ordered the trail size of this product & it comes in a cute little glass dropper style bottle. This serum specifically states on the listing that it will not clog pores & is intended for dry skin. I love this one just as much as the Indigo serum. I would say this is the lightest, in terms of weight & oiliness it leaves on the face compared to the other two. It feels as if it sinks in faster than the other two. I do prefer to use a bit more in my hand to get an even layer spread out, but it is perfect for adding it underneath my daily moisturizer. I only wear this one in the morning since it is so lightweight. I plan on purchasing a FS of this on my next order. Although I am curious about the Silk Serum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion, I absolutely love everything about Chikyu. From the amazing customer service, the high quality & intention with each creation, the reliability of knowing I will receive my products & that the turn around time is consistently quick, & the fact that is actually making my skin feel better. In regards to my skincare needs, I have seen a significant reduction in the milia I usually have on my cheekbones, my dry patches that I tend to get on the sides of my nose/under eye area are not an issue, & with proper usage of cleansing & adequate moisturizing of my face, my blackhead/sebaceous filaments have become less apparent. I did not realize that I was over-cleansing & under-moisturizing my face before & that was what was making my pores look so raggedy & sad! Also, my hands have been feeling the love & are not scary lizard skin looking like before. They are soft & happy!! I highly, highly recommend at the very least, ordering some samples if you are curious. There is so much to try, that I am positive you will find something that works for you. If you made it this far, thank you for reading my thoughts!! I would absolutely love to hear about anyone else's experience with Chikyu products, especially ones I haven’t mentioned! I do have a lot more product samples I haven’t touched yet, & plan on leaving another review eventually! I tried to be thorough & I hope I didn't leave anything out! Have a nice day!",

    "body": "**Video Link:**\n\n[Click Here](https://youtu.be/eiUUuj4L7LQ)\n\n**Disclosure Statements**\n\n* The Hecho SMA shaving soap and aftershave serum were kindly gifted by u/RobInFresno\n* I bought the Dogwood Handcrafts/Maggard Timberwolf brush with my own money\n* I bought the GEM Damaskeene (Open Comb) with my own money\n\n**Write-up**:\n\n[Hecho SMA](https://www.hechosma.com/) is a cosmetics and grooming company based in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. In addition to making things like bar soaps, hand washes, and pomades, they also make a few shaving items such as shaving soap, cream, and aftershaves. Thanks to u/RobInFresno, this week I was able to try out their shaving soap “Sweet Lumberjack” and their bergamot aftershave serum.\n\nHecho SMA’s shaving soaps all have a relatively simple formula, which includes ingredients like shea, kokum, jojoba, rice bran oil, and other essential soap ingredients like glycerin and sodium lactate. Their shaving soaps are also advertised as being suitable for beard washing, so it makes sense that they have smaller ingredients list and come as circular bars of soap, unlike the typical American artisan soaps. The Spanish name for the soap scent is “Madera Especiada”, which roughly translates to “spiced wood”, which I think better describes the scent I perceive off the soap. It’s lightly scented and I don’t think it would offend anyone. Thanks to the help of r/wetshaving’s newest soaper u/USS-Spongebob, I’m inclined to believe that all of the scents in this soap are added with essential oils, as things like patchouli, lime, and citrus are written at the end of the ingredients list, but there are no other fragrances listed.\n\nPerformance wise, I found the soap incredibly easy to lather up with both a boar and synthetic brush. You can load the brush with basically any amount of water in your brush, as some days I started with a very dry brush and others with a very wet brush, yet I was able to achieve good results with both methods. The ease of lather reminded me of the vintage Colgate soap I reviewed several weeks ago. Is it coincidence that they are both hard pucks of soap? I think not! Hecho SMA’s lather has a bit more density and luxury feeling compared to Colgate, and they are similar in terms of not having much residual slickness, which isn’t a deal-breaker for me. With the addition of a few ingredients and changes in proportions of others, this could easily become an excellent soap. This soap retails for 265 Pesos ($13 USD), and I think it is worth the price. Overall, it’s an easy to use, *good* soap that could surely serve a purpose in some people’s shave dens worldwide.\n\nFor post-shave this week I exclusively used a sample of Hecho SMA’s aftershave serum, which has simple, pleasant bergamot scent. This serum is the oiliest one I’ve used compared to the other balm-like ones I’ve used in the past, but it doesn’t leave your skin feeling oily whatsoever. It absorbs quickly into the skin, and leaves a satisfying feel that would seem to compliment the usually warmer weather in a place like San Miguel de Allende. The aftershave is advertised as a botanical serum containing ingredients like argan oil, rice bran oil, meadowfoam oil, cucumber extract, and sea buckthorn extract. Retailing at 645 Pesos or $30 USD for 50mL of product, this seems like a fair price to me. The next time I order something from Mexico I’ll look to include a full-sized bottle of the serum with my shipment ☺\n\n**Next week** I’ll be continuing the international theme and reviewing a soap and aftershave from Croatia, which were kindly sent to me for review. They both smell great and I’m excited to use them for all of this coming week. Until next time, thank you all for reading this review and watching my videos!",

    "body": "  \n\nHi everyone! It’s another Death and Floral review, 2 months after I said I’d write one (where does the quarantine time go?).\n\nJust another story of Brim’s amazing customer service – I ordered a sample pack, plus the two additional samples she was sending with every order at the time. I wasn’t sure if I could request samples of LE scents, so I put two LE and two general catalog ones as backup in the notes. She sent all four. It was such a sweet surprise. \n\nI tried them after resting about a week, and I’ve worn each scent several times since then.  Here are my overall impressions.\n\n**Amy March (LE) -** *French lavender macaroons, young spring flowers (Iris and lilac) and fresh Parisian rain.*\n\nI picked this one because I LOVE lilac and iris, but I wasn’t sure about the lavender (goes overwhelming on me easily). I was thrilled that I didn’t get that much lavender! On me, Amy March is a sweet floral, with a lightness from the rain accord. Wet, the “freshness” of the scent is sharper than I’d like, almost veering soapy. Still, it’s lovely on drydown. A great spring scent.\n\n**The Soft Crunch of Bread and Bone -** *Flakey coconut French Madelines, stifling bakery air, vanilla cremé and crunchy macarons, the last sip of green tea with a mysterious lover.*\n\nI’m a gourmand girl, so I had a hunch I’d like this scent. And I do!! I get the macarons and madelines, a strong almond, a bit of the green tea. It evokes a scent memory of the particular café I did my homework in when I studied abroad in Spain. Really lovely and comforting. Hope to full-size this someday.\n\n**Decomposing roses for a decomposed romance** *Rose, white musk, vanilla, pink peppercorn, honeysuckle.*\n\nI was nervous about this one since I read reviews that the pepper was too peppery for some people. And in the bottle, yes, it’s PEPPER. But on my skin, it transforms into that spicy, vanilla rose I was hoping for. I don’t get much honeysuckle, which is too bad. I normally like my roses sweet (a la Rose Mallow Cream), but this is an interesting scent to add to my collection! I’ll definitely keep wearing my sample, but I’m not sure if I need a full size.\n\n**The sweater we buried you with is hanging in my closet -** *A luscious blend of three different vanillas, resinous amber, Arabian sandalwood, a soft cashmere sweater.*\n\nThis is one I’d like to try in an EDP or their new oil format (pretty sure this was still the rice bran oil and not the fractionated coconut oil she switched to?). All my other samples had decent longevity, this one just didn’t. It’s a pretty amber/vanilla, a my-skin-but-better kind of scent. Unfortunately, it became just-my-skin-and-nothing-else within an hour on me. I may try it with a primer at some point in the future.\n\n**Swamp Elixir -** *Soft honeysuckle and mossy oak trees, blended with water lilies and sparkling pink lemonade.*\n\nSwamp Elixir immediately gained a place as one of my favorite samples. The pink lemonade and honeysuckle blend together seamlessly to make a feminine, floral gourmand. Wet, the lemonade is very strong, but the other notes came out to play on drydown. I can never identify the “mossy oak trees,” but I don't mind. I would love to get a full size.\n\n**Nothing Rusts in the Desert, the Air is Full of Ghosts -** *Pink cactus flowers and sweet grass, with notes of warm rain and woody dry vanilla.*\n\nI set my hopes too high for Nothing Rusts. I love the smell of sweetgrass and I rarely see it as a note in perfumes (maybe due to ethical sourcing issues, like sage). I normally just have to huff braided sweetgrass at every opportunity. This really is a nice scent, very floral, and I get the warmness of the rain and a backdrop of woodiness (not such much vanilla). I like it, but I remain on the hunt for a sweetgrass scent.\n\n**Filled with the Heat of a Reckless Summer -** *Realistic blueberry bush, honeysuckle wafting in the air, surrounded by the scent of an aging barn.*\n\nI thought this one sounded cool and had the potential to evoke some scents memories from my own aging barn/honeysuckle/berry bush childhood. Instead, I found it remarkably similar to a scent I already own: Lou Lou’s Blueberry Cheesecake. This perfume is only *marginally* less sweet than Lou Lou’s BC, without the crust note and with an added floral component. \n\n(In case you’re curious, I also compared it to Haus of Gloi Blueberry Tart. Filled with the Heat reads as a stronger, sweeter blueberry on me than Blueberry Tart.)\n\nSo, do I like the perfume? Yes, it smells delicious! Is it what I expected? No. I probably won’t full-size, since I already have a full size of Blueberry Cheesecake that fills the same niche for me.\n\n**Buried Beneath the Shallow Hay** \\- *Aging barn wood, the musk of a lingering spirit, old and weathered hay bales.*\n\nIn the bottle, this is all musk to me. On skin, the hay note dominates. I’m leery of hay as a perfume note, since I’ve had unfortunate experiences with it smelling like musty hay bales that were left in a field to rot. Despite the ‘old and weathered’ description, this hay note is more tolerable. I don’t know if I *love* it, but it’s atmospheric. Will save this one for when I’m living in a city again and miss home.",

It’s an amazing bar of soap. \n\nBoth recipes move slow and are ideal for swirls and intricate designs. I soap at 85-95F, I use 1 tsp ppo sodium lactate, sugar and kaolin clay in all my recipes. As well as mulberry silk in my lye water. I soap using a 1.8:1 water : lye ratio, but you can do 2:1 to give more work time. ",

I've been thinking to switching to a more relatively healthier type of frying oil such as peanut oil or rice bran oil. But comparing the prices, it's twice as expensive as coconut oil. My family usually use like 1L in 2-3 weeks. I can't usually reuse oil since most of my cooking would impart some taste in the oil.\n \nI don't like canola since at high temps it smells like fish and I can taste it through the food. My other options would be corn oil and that vaguely described vegetable oil.",

The peanut oil is for cooking Chinese and Asian dishes, plus deep/shallow frying. The olive oil is for finishing dishes, dressings, etc. or in cooking where I specifically want then olive flavor. I used to stock EVOO and regular olive oil, but regular olive oil sometimes has oils from something other than olives, so I just use the EVOO instead.\n\nThey are some of the pricier oils, but seem to have health benefits relative to other oils.

    "body": "This is cheating because it didn't happen this week, but it is recent and interesting enough I'll share it anyway.  \n  \nStarting about 2 weekends ago we started having droves of people come to the pharmacy looking for **decolorized iodine**. I had never even heard of the stuff before. Apparently there was an ad in the local newspaper and a post on The People's Pharmacy selling it as a miracle cure for **toenail fungus**. Still haven't seen any evidence that it actually works, but we ordered something like 50 bottles and sold out the same day. For 2 weeks now the demand has been constant and every time we get it in stock it sells out immediately. Would be curious if anyone knows any more about it. Does it work?   \n  \nA new study in the Journal of Infectious Disease found a **shingles / Zostavax(R) booster** to be safe and effective in people over 70 who had original dose more than 10 years ago. This is particularly relevant to my store, which has a large elderly population. People are always asking if they need a booster of this or that.  \n  \nLearned that **plant sterols / phytosterols** are recommended *early* in ACC/AHA 2013 and NLA 2015 guidelines for **lowering LDL cholesterol**, before trying drug treatment. **Rice bran oil** has the highest phytosterol concentration by far at 1055 mg/100 g. Most people get about 200 to 300 mg daily eating a Western diet and the effective dose is about 2000 mg.  \n  \nFew Rite Aid specific tips:  \n  \nIf you write out the generic name for **Hycodan(R) / Hydromet(R)** on a 222 order form *as it appears in NextGen* the distributor will send it back as being wrong. You have to write out \"Hydrocodone/Homatropine 5-1.5 mg/5 mL\" exactly.  \n  \nWant to get that part-time employee a **free flu shot** and boost your numbers? Even if they don't have insurance, RA will pay for their shot. Use the card text \"flu vaccinations for rite aid employees\" and the ID number equals the employee ID number.  \n  \nWant to get a **return to stock label** but the system won't let you print it out for the bottle you have in your hand? Go to WIMO and search for the drug name. Find an order for the same drug (careful, make sure it is the same NDC) and click on it ONCE without going into the order. The \"Print return to stock label\" button should ungrey and become clickable. Just be careful to black out the Rx# and Qty, because they may not match the bottle you have in your hand.\n  \nHow about you? Did you learn anything interesting or exciting this week?",

However, instead of adjusting rate, pharmacy adjusts the concentration of heparin in order to achieve the same units/kg/hr since the machine that controls the Impella will decide it's own rate.\n\nWhen the aPTT is lower than target range, we can add on a peripheral heparin drip to reach the desired units/kg/hr, but when the aPTT is high, we have to reduce the concentration of heparin. This was complicated by the fact that the machine would only recognize certain concentrations of heparin (50 units/ml, 25, 12.5, 10, 5, and 0). I don't know if there are different machines with different settings, but this was true on our machine.\n\nThe purge solution is also based in D20 because the viscosity combined with the pressure from the infusion will overcome the patients own blood pressure to allow the device to continue turning the correct direction instead of the blood pressure forcing the motor into the opposite direction. So the purge solution could be compounded in lower concentrations of dextrose or even in NS or other solutions, but the infusion rate will increase to compensate for the lowered viscosity and lowered resistance.",

    "body": "I keep seeing some B&M scents mentioned that are no longer for sale and was wondering if it would be fun to compile a complete list of all of their scents. I did this a while back for Fine Accoutrements as a lot of people didn't know they used to have the \"Blue\" and the \"Sweet Tobacco\" scents. This is what I believe to be the complete history of B&M soaps, for your information and enjoyment.\n\n**Lime, Lavendar, and Cedarwood** - The original, sent out to testers in Jan 2013.\n*(Top notes of lime are softened by notes of earthy lavender and deep cedarwood. An invigorating, masculine scent.)*\n\n**Bay Rum** - Mar 2013 *(Bay Rum: This is a classic bay rum scent consisting of West Indian Bay (none of that cooking bay stuff), sweet orange, real blackstrap rum, benzoin (a warm, vanilla-like scent), and just a hint of cassia cinnamon, which provides a pleasant warmth. A favorite for winter, but great for any time of year. Note that my bay rum is entirely clove-free.)*\n\n**Seville** - Mar 2013 *(Seville: A traditional barbershop scent, this soap contains bergamot, lemon, patchouli, oakmoss, lavender, and rosemary. A fresh, clean fragrance that goes with pretty much anything.)*\n\n**Vetiver, Heather, and Clary Sage** - Mar 2013 *(A floral, but still deeply earthy scent that calls to mind the fragrance houses of Jermyn St., St. James, and Savile Row.)*\n\n**Winter Spice** - Mar 2013 *(A cozy, rich fragrance with top notes of sweet orange and amaretto bolstered by the warmth of cinnamon. Perfect for that cold winter's night when you just have to shave.)*\n\n**Ferox** - Late Mar 2013 *(A bright, springly, invigorating combination of grapefruit, sage, thyme, rosemary, tea tree, and vetiver.)*\n\n**Cheshire** - Late May 2013 *(A combination of bergamot, clary sage, lavender, and patchouli, this soap captures the classic essence of Earl Grey tea using only high-quality essential oils. The perfect complement to the morning routine of the discerning shaver.)*\n\n**Solstice** - Late Jun 2013 *(A rich and elegant combination of lemon, black pepper, and rose absolute with just a touch of peppermint.)*\n\n**Nocturne** - Late Sept 2013 *(After the aroma of a New England Harvest Festival using the scents of apples, newly fallen leaves, woodsmoke, styrax benzoin, and the faintest touch of cinnamon.)*\n\n**Hallows** - Mid Oct 2013 - Limited as fuck, only 20 made. *(We were tasked with creating a seasonal scent unlike any the world had ever seen before. Taking inspiration from the swamps of Boston, we combined vetiver, oakmoss, black pepper, cocoa, labdanum, and cedar to produce a deep, cold scent suited to the chilly, bitter days of late October. Gloomy, rich, and perversely elegant, Hallows is a reminder of why men once feared the dark.)*\n\n**Roam** - Mid Nov 2013 *(Inspired by the rugged individualism of American cattle ranchers, we blended the aromas of real pipe tobacco absolute, smoke, leather, herbs, damp earth, and grass into a bright, robust scent reminiscent of life on the open range. Timeless and virile, Roam harkens back to the days of the Old West.)*\n\n**Dickens** - Mid Nov 2013 *(Patterned after one of our favorite holiday cookies, this soap combines notes of cherry, black pepper, nutmeg, cardamom, and lemon into a spicy, sweet, festive soap just perfect for a shave before that ugly sweater party that your boss is making you attend.)*\n\n**Tre Citta (Almond)** - Mid Nov 2013 *(Drawing upon the results of our shaving cream research, we created a completely vegan shaving soap comprised of only five main ingredients: stearic acid, castor oil, coconut oil, rice bran oil, and glycerin. This simple but superb soap produces a beautifully thick, rich, lubricious lather at the cost of no animal lives and is scented with the traditional almond fragrance for which the originals are so justly famous. The name comes from the Italian term for \"Three Cities,\" a reference to the Genoan, Milanese, and Neapolitan master soapmakers of the Old World to which we pay homage.)*\n\n**Vanille** - Late Jan 2014 - Limited as fuck, only 36 made. *(Scented with a combination of real bourbon vanilla absolute and the richly vanillic and woody resin styrax benzoin. Together, the oils combine to produce the most gorgeous vanilla scent in shaving today, a voluptuous, elegant, and deeply sensual fragrance that will remind your date of the meaning of desire.)*\n\n**Tre Citta First Snow** - Late Feb 2014 *(Premised on the notion of a \"gentleman's menthol,\" First Snow is comprised of a fresh, invigorating blend of real fir needle oil with hints of leather and just a touch of menthol. This is no face-freezer but instead a clean, natural-smelling soap with a hint of coolness to brighten up your morning.)*\n\n**Saeryan** - Late Mar 2014 *(Some describe it as \"candy floral\" or \"spicy flowers,\" but, to us, it smells simply of Springtime. To that end, Barrister & Mann blended ethereally beautiful facets of violet, clover, petitgrain, bergamot, and hops to create a crisp, slightly bitter citrus floral scent that invokes memories of cool, quiet Sunday mornings spent drinking tea in the sunshine. Sparklingly elegant, Saeryan is a soap best reserved for when you want to feel your very finest.)*\n\n**Fougère Aromatique (In Tallow and Tre Citta)** - Late May 2014 - Limited, only 40 tallow and 40 TC made. *(We blended the fragrance with touches of lime, cardamom, and thyme as an homage to Invasion Barbare, Stephanie Bakouche's remarkable aromatic masterpiece. The rest of the skeleton is constructed around geranium, clary sage absolute, violet leaf, and various other natural oils to produce a full-power, teeth-out scent completely divested of any resemblance to the prim little English fripperies that followed the original. Rich, gleamingly spicy, and utterly without pretense, Fougère Aromatique is a reminder of what it means to carry yourself with style.)*\n\n**Fougère Imperiale (In Tallow and Tre Citta)** - Late May 2014 - Limited, only 40 tallow and 40 TC made. *(We built the scent on an accord of oakmoss, French lavender, tonka bean, and hay absolute, a smell akin to liquid sunshine. We then added West Indian Sandalwood (actually a plant called Amyris) and Siberian Fir for a woody, mineral effect similar to that of the drier fougères that characterized the 1950s and 60s. The rest of the skeleton is constructed around geranium, clary sage absolute, violet leaf, and various other natural oils to produce a fresh, clean, elegant scent reminiscent of the smell of a father's shaving set. Bright, understated, and charmingly smooth, Fougère Imperiale is the ultimate progression of natural perfumery.)*\n\n**Tre Citta Tangerine and Ylang Ylang** - Late May 2014 *(Tangerine/Ylang Ylang is a bright, heady combination of tangerine and ylang ylang essential oils. In order to avoid an overpoweringly floral smell, the fragrance has been balanced so that the ylang ylang is detectable and supports the tangy citrus of the tangerine, but is not overwhelmingly heady.)*\n\n**Adiago** - Jun 2014 *(A “cool green fruit” fragrance consisting of lime, cherry, violet leaf absolute, lily of the valley, and a beautiful floral musk called Galaxolide. The soap is rounded off with a light mentholated coolness, not super cold but enough to refresh the face in the swelteringly hot weather of Summer.)*\n\n**Tre Citta Petrichor** - Late Jul 2014 *(A soap that smells like damp earth after a Spring rain. Utterly unlike anything else we have ever smelled, Petrichor conjures images of Scottish moors and damp forests sparkling with dew.)*\n\n**Tre Citta Arctique** - Late Jul 2014 *(We blended our lovely floral/black pepper base with Japanese Peppermint and enough menthol to make even the most hardened skin prickle in fear. The goal was to create one of the coldest soaps on Earth, the kind of soap that separates the hobbyists from the seriously dedicated. We’re proud to say that we were successful. It is unbelievable. It is horribly, hatefully, bone-chillingly cold.)*\n\n**Lavanille** - Late Jul 2014 *(Chiefly built on our recreation of the famous Mousse de Saxe perfume base, blended with lavender, vanilla, cedar wood, and the elegant musk Exaltolide to create a dark, leathery, elegant soap unlike anything seen for nearly a half century.)*\n\n**Tre Citta Anise & Vetiver** - Early Sept *(The famous Robin's Candy Shop in Boston stocks a remarkably dry, rich licorice from Denmark with deliciously tangy undertones. This soap smells rather like that. Sweet, woody, and slightly salty, Anise & Vetiver is one of those soaps that smells so good that you have to stop yourself from tasting the lather. You know, for science.)*\n\n**Tre Citta Caledonia Rose** - Early Sept 2014 *(The original intent behind Caledonia Rose was to produce a rose/sandalwood soap using only the necessary plant absolutes. Unfortunately, we couldn't quite get it to where we were satisfied with it. We had hoped that the scent would be stronger (though it's definitely still rosy), so we've decided to simply charge just enough to cover our investment and only produce one batch. It's a gentle, smooth rose scent with creamy sandalwood undercurrents and the same great performance as all of our vegan soaps. A singular batch not to be missed!)*\n\n**Tre Citta Vetyver Santal** - Early Sept 2014 *(We blended a healthy dose of lemon essential oil with Haitian vetiver and elegant, creamy New Caledonia sandalwood absolute to create a light, clean, fresh vetiver scent well-suited to cooler weather. Refined and gentlemanly, Vetyver Santal harkens back to classic fragrances from the Golden Age.)*\n\n**Leviathan** - Late Sept 2014 *(We discovered the formula for an archaic, forgotten Russian leather accord and blended it with notes of sandalwood, coffee, cedar, and musk to create a dark, feral scent well-suited to its namesake. Elemental and at times slightly unsettling, Leviathan is a scent to accompany you to the end of the world.)*\n\n____\n\n***Future Products***\n\n____\n\n***Black Label*** - 2014\n\nI'll update this section as I find new information, but here's what I know so far.\n\n***Preshave***\n \nA [Noxzema](http://www.noxzema.com/products/original-cleansing-cream) type preshave to (maybe) go along with the scents of the other products.\n\n***Soaps***\n\n**Lavender** Straight-up intense lavender essential oil. Like, intense enough that you can smell it across the room.\n\n**Orange & Cedar** Sweet Orange and Virginia Cedar essential oils. Classic French scent, very clean and masculine.\n\n**Rosemary & Peppermint** Japanese Peppermint, which has a higher menthol content than Peppermint Supreme (which is what people usually think of when they think of peppermint), so this soap will be relatively cool. The mint is balanced out by Spanish Rosemary essential oil. Nice and clean and herbal.\n\n**Beaudelaire** A bright, clean fougère supported by a rich, dark, bitter leather note. This is the fragrance that Oscar Wilde would have worn.\n\nNOTE: All of the tallow based Black Label soaps will contain Sodium Citrate in an effort to make the soaps easier to lather in hard water.\n\n***Aftershave***\n\nI know very little about this but I believe it's an alcohol based aftershave based on the same scents.\n\n____\n\n**Fireside** - Late Dec 2014 *(Cognac, anise, vanilla, cedar)*\n____\n\nI will say that Will has certainly gotten better at writing copy over the last year. If there's anything I've missed please let me know! If there's any information you'd like me to add, please let me know! If anything is wrong, let me know.\n\nIf you liked this at all, let me know and I might do another one for a different artisan company.\n\nKeep in mind this is a history of their soaps, not their other products. Thanks!",

The *tallow* Black Label soaps will contain sodium citrate, but I found that it was not necessary with the Tre Citta formula and thus am not going to bother with it. \n\nAs for the aftershave, it is indeed alcohol-based. The initial scents will match those of the Black Label soaps (and the aftershave will be sold as part of the Black Label line), but there will be other scents once I figure out what to do about US alcohol shipping restrictions. If nothing else, there will be an aftershave released with the re-issue of the fougères entitled \"Fougère Classique\" that will utilize my discovery of the original formula for *Fougère Royale*. There will eventually be a short run of Vetiver/Heather/Clary Sage Kyovu, done in much the same way as the Roam Kyovu was, but I haven't yet decided whether I wish to create a full-scale vetiver aftershave fragrance. I CAN tell you that there will be two Tre Citta releases incorporating vetiver over the course of the next six weeks, though.",

It was a bit frustrating it took 2 months to figure that out, but I'm hoping my latest attempt goes better.  Now there's the Ceramidin mist to consider and winter is coming....",

Hope it helps!\n\n“For high heat, Chef Keller uses a plant-based oil with a high smoke point and a neutral flavor (e.g., grapeseed). Your budget and preferences will dictate your choice of oil. Use this chart comparing the smoke point of oils as a reference.”\n\nOil Smoke Points\n\nRefined Avocado Oil 510°-520°f**\n\nSafflower Oil 510°f\n\nRice Bran Oil 490°f\n\nLight/Refined Olive Oil 465°f\n\nOlive Pomace Oil 460°f\n\nSoybean Oil 450°f\n\nPeanut Oil 450°f\n\nClarified Butter 450°f\n\nCorn Oil 450°f\n\nSunflower Oil 440°f\n\nVegetable Oil 400-450°f\n\nBeef Tallow 400°f\n\nCanola Oil 400°f\n\nGrapeseed Oil 390°f\n\nPork Lard 370°f\n\n(Unrefined Extra-Virgin) Avocado Oil 375-400°f*\n\nChicken Fat (Schmaltz) 375°f\n\nDuck Fat 375°f\n\nVegetable Shortening 360°f\n\nSesame Oil 350-410°f\n\nButter 350°f\n\nCoconut Oil 350°f\n\nExtra-Virgin Olive Oil 325-375°f\n\n*Edit: From Masterclass website: “Avocado Oil: Pressed from fresh avocado pulp, which is up to 25 percent fat, avocado oil has the highest smoke point of all plant-based cooking oils (510 to 520°F). It's over 50 percent monounsaturated fat, which makes avocado oil less prone to oxidation than polyunsaturated oils, but still liquid at room temperature (unlike saturated fats).”\n\nI’ve emailed MasterClass about the difference listed for avocado oil.  They replied asking for screenshots.  Waiting on a further reply.\n\n**Edit 2: Reply from MasterClass: “Firstly, I would like thanks for this to reporting this thing with us. Now, we have checked the 520F number is specifically for refined avocado oil while 375 is for unrefined, extra-virgin avocado oil. Also, I would like to share that we are going ahead and will edit our online article to specify this.”\n\nSpecial thanks to users here for asking for clarification.

    "body": "Apothescary Scents' botanical perfumes contain essential oils in an organic rice bran oil base. TAT and shipping was good, since it arrived within a week of my purchase, and I am reviewing the fall inspired Something Wicked Collection, inspired by Ray Bradbury's \"Something Wicked This Way Comes\".\n\n[Apothescary Scents Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ApothescaryScents)\n\n**Shadow Show** (*Ripe apples, buttery-sweet caramel corn, cured tobacco, vetiver, amber*)\n\n*Out of the Bottle*\n\nWhen I smell from the bottle, I get a strong butter note first, with a little of the apple to round it out. Some apple scents are super-sweet remnants of their true form. This apple reminds of going to the apple orchards when I was a kid, and smelling the ripe apples that had fallen from the tree and that were in my basket. If you've been to an orchard, you know the apple smell you get when you put the apple under your nose, or when it's sliced open for samples. That apple smell. I smell the amber warmth too, but don’t get the individual tobacco notes. The scent is buttery, fruity and warm.\n\n*On My Skin*\n\nI smell the apple much more strongly, and my scent memories invade again. Running through the orchard to my mom to give her a golden delicious I had found, or a jonathan. Aaahh. The butter and caramel have toned way down, but they're still there, and blend more seamlessly with the apple as it dries down. I would definitely say this is a more foodie scent, but it has the depth I sorely need. It's rich, warm and complex, but comforting and reminiscent of home at the same time. Like making apple pie from scratch in my parent's kitchen. It's a little buttery with some caramel, and much more fruity, like ripe, orchard apples or apple cider. Now, my family needs to get to an apple orchard, STAT. \n\nEdit: I wrote this section last week, and then convinced my family to go to an apple orchard this past weekend. So, thank you, perfume.\n\n**Autumn People** (*Blood orange, wood smoke, fallen leaves, oakmoss*)\n\n*Out of the Bottle*\n\nThe blood orange scent is rich and moist. The scent is citrusy and fruity, with a little bit of the dried leaves notes in the background, and the oakmoss contributes a warm, earthy and green scent, which coalesces with the blood orange quite nicely. I don't get much of the wood smoke notes, it's just a citrusy scent with subtle notes of dried leaves and oakmoss.  \n\n*On My Skin*\n\nI get the rich, moist blood orange first. It's almost like I cut into one and the peel spritzes my fingers with oil. It's the most prominent note as it dries down, and is slightly woody. Fresh, citrusy and light, but still deep. Then the oakmoss appears, and a green and citrusy scent with a slightly mossy scent, which is really pleasant. It's like walking through the woods and smelling the slightly damp moss beneath your feet. Unlike some citrus containing perfumes, the blood orange stays around for a lot longer. \n\n**Carousel of Dreams** (*Sandalwood, frankincense, clove, cardamom*)\n\n*Out of the Bottle*\n\nWhen I smell from the bottle, the scent is spicy, a little woody and warm from the sandalwood and frankincense. I can smell a hint of the cardamom aroma, but it's subdued, and I don't really smell the clove. \n\n*On My Skin*\n\nI smell frankincense, clove and cardamom in the first minute when I apply them. I love this – it's a very, very warm, slightly spicy perfume. It's a little smokey to me, but just barely. While it continues to dry down, it also takes on a slight sweetness that compliments that smokiness. Again, it's subtle, but it reminds of the sweet wood smoke that you get from a campfire and you've snuffed out the flame, and the wood charcoal continues to glisten and burn in the pit. Maybe that's a combination of the sandalwood and frankincense, hmmm. \n\n**Dust Witch** (*Dark patchouli, cedar, clove, amber and more*)\n\n*Out of the Bottle*\n\nWhen I smell from the sample vial, I get the sweet, aged patchouli right off the bat. It's spicy and sensual, and warm. It’s comforting, but mysterious. It's so intoxicating, and the scent makes me think of a haunted mansion – it's a little sweet, a little dusty, earthy and you can smell its age, in a good way. Or, it's like hugging someone close, and breathing in the sweet and spicy scent of their clothing, but it's fresh, and inviting. I don't get much of the cedar or clove, but I the warmth from the amber. If you haven't smelled dark patchouli, the sweetness may come across as cloying, but it doesn't smell cloying or sugary sweet to my nose, it just smells good.\n\n*On My Skin*\n\nThis is one of my favorites. When I put it on my skin, it's sweet from the dark patchouli, a little woodsy, and I smell a little clove, but it's in the background, it's very subtle. As it dries down, I smell more of the cedar coming through, which reinforces the haunted mansion vibes I was getting straight from the bottle. The sweet dark patchouli and cedar mingle together really well, and it produces this sweet, spicy and woody scent that is really appealing, at least to my nose. \n\n**Mr. Dark** (*Black peppercorn, lime, musky, exotic woods*)\n\n*Out of the Bottle*\n\nWhen I sniffed from the sample vial, I inhaled and coughed. The peppercorn bites! It's like I grabbed my pepper out of the spice cabinet and knocked back a shot into my nose. It's hard to even smell out of the bottle, because the peppercorn is so strong. When I smell it from a distance, I can only barely catch the lime. \n\n*On My Skin*\n\nOn my skin, the lime brightens and sweetens up, while the pepper is just spicy enough that it compliments the lime. As it dries down and throughout the rest of the day, the lime scent actually sticks around for a little bit, then the sweetness remains to complement the pepper. This was the most unexpected surprise, since I felt for sure I wouldn't like it because of the coughing episode while smelling from the bottle. I don't usually like scents with pepper in the notes, but Mr. Dark actually smells really pleasant on my skin, and I like it a lot.\n\n**Scent Intensity & Wear Time**\n\nAll of them have very strong scent intensity, and I can smell them on myself as I move, while my husband can smell them as soon as he walks in the apartment. All of them last for 8+ hours and they don't really lessen in scent intensity on myself as they sit on my skin throughout the day. They also last through washing my hands and doing dishes. If you want a long lasting botanical perfume that has good throw, you may want to try these scents out. \n\n**Brand Overview**\n\nMy favorites are Dust Witch, Shadow Show and Carousel of Dreams, but I still do really like Autumn People. Mr. Dark was a thumbs up for me and anyone who wants to try a really satisfying lime and peppercorn combo. I highly recommend any of these scents to try if the notes appeal to you, since the scent intensity is strong, and the longevity and throw are good.  But, and I get into this issue further in a minute, if you have a sensitive nose, I would highly recommend samples first to see if they are right for you.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere’s the rub.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI can't wear these, at least when applied by tipping the oil onto my arm from the bottle. It's way too strong, and although they don't give me a headache at any point, it's definitely on the verge. By the end of the day, the scent cloud around me is *intense*. Either the base notes are too highly concentrated for my nose, or the ratio of fragrant oils to carrier oil is too high for my taste. It was even hard for me to go to sleep when I tried these the first day – I had to hold my arms away from me so I could peacefully drift off. The next day, I decided to wash it off before bed, and that was much more tolerable. When I wear these again, I would dab a cotton swab or clean metal spatula in the oil to apply a small amount, and probably only in one place on my body. They may also benefit from resting, but I've only had them for about a week, so it's too early to tell on that *note*. Think it's funny? Terrible puns are my specialty... I liked the scents, but they are too strong at the moment, and I will have to change my mode of application to compensate. However, these are only my experiences – tell me what you think if you've ordered these scents!\n\nNote: I am not affiliated with this brand.

    "body": "On another post, I mentioned an elimination diet that I've been going through to test histamine and anti-inflammatory foods. I wanted to put a separate post together since it's kind of a weird assortment of information. The research is *very* limited and so this is just a summary of what I found, not any advice. I found two food intolerances, a definite inflammatory response to sugar, and no effect from the histamine foods. Hopefully it's worth the read for some of you and you get more improvement.\n\nI used the app MySymptoms ([https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mhs.mysymptoms](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mhs.mysymptoms)) to track food, symptoms, all the things. Definitely read the directions because the method for correlation function that it uses wasn't obvious and a few days of my data weren't the same as the rest.\n\nMy approach was a week of only rice, chicken (marinated in olive oil/salt), and broccoli. I added in onions on day 5 because I was losing my goddamn mind. From day 7, I added a new food every three days. Depending on your GI cycle, you might want to go up to 5 days between foods. I added in: apples, almond butter, milk, wheat, corn, mango, eggs, peas/carrots (same day), coffee, refined sugar, vinegar, potatoes, black tea, pepper (e.g. bell pepper, not peppercorns), cheese, peanut butter, chocolate. My list to still add includes tomatoes, beans, citrus, yeast, other nuts, soy, fish, fermented soy (miso/soy sauce), red meat. I also removed the broccoli and onions for a week each after I had enough other ingredients, just to test those, too.\n\nThe order I added them was based on how high risk foods were expected to be for intolerance/histamine rxn/inflammatory response, then how much it messed with my life to not have said food. Later on, I alternated a higher risk food with a lower risk food to give a little bit more time for stuff to react.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Resources:**\n\nI primarily focused on histamine research. These are in order of my perception of the reliability of the sources (based on having done research for a job, blah blah arbitrary self perceived qualifications)\n\n\\[1\\] Histamine Intolerance: The Current State of the Art; Baste 2020 - this is a great literature review and is very clear about the limited study, small sample sizes, and generally poor controls on the research that's been done to date, but aggregates it in a pretty clear way\n\n\\[2\\] [https://www.mastzellaktivierung.info/downloads/foodlist/21\\_FoodList\\_EN\\_alphabetic\\_withCateg.pdf](https://www.mastzellaktivierung.info/downloads/foodlist/21_FoodList_EN_alphabetic_withCateg.pdf)\n\n\\[3\\] [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/dao-supplement](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/dao-supplement); Hill 2019\n\n\\[4\\] [https://www.healthline.com/health/histamine-intolerance](https://www.healthline.com/health/histamine-intolerance); Murrell 2019\n\n\\[5A\\] review of Dr. Janice Joneja, Ph.D. RD.; Allergy UK; The Swiss Allergy Center; The Swiss Interest Group Histamine Intolerance\n\n\\[5B\\] Is Food Making You Sick?

    "body": "**Attempt #1**\n\nFor my first attempt, I decided to use rice bran oil as I already had some in my house. \n\nWhile I had been advised to begin with 5% polysorbate, I had seen a lot of people preferring to use 10%, so I (spoilers: stupidly) decided to use 10% as well. \n\nSo the recipe was:\n- 90% Rice Bran Oil\n- 10% Polysorbate 85\n\n*Results*\n\nOkay, first off, it was stupid to ignore the advice I was given to begin with 5% polysorbate. While I didn't suffer from any immediate redness or irritation, after four days of use I noticed that my dry, sensitive skin was much dryer than usual, particularly around the eye area. I also had a few cystic pimples pop up, which is quite unusual for me. I discontinued using this recipe immediately then. \n\nI also found while using this recipe that the Rice Bran Oil was too viscous for my liking. I prefer an oil that is very easily spread around the face. I certainly won't use it alone again, but may use it in conjunction with another oil in the future.\n\n**Attempt #2**\n\nFor my second attempt, I followed the advice given to me to use 5% polysorbate, and switched to sunflower oil.\n\nRecipe:\n- 95% Sunflower oil\n- 5% Polysorbate 85\n\n*Results*\n\nThe sunflower oil was much thinner than the rice bran oil, and I enjoyed using it. I didn't suffer from any dryness or unusual acne this time, so it seems that 5% is a good amount of polysorbate for me. I used this version up.\n\nIt might be helpful to know that 50ml lasted me just over 3 weeks with twice-daily use. \n\n**Attempt #3**\n\nI have only just begun this attempt, so I have no results to share, but I think now that I know that 5% polysorbate is best, I will be unlikely to experience any super negative effects.\n\nFor this attempt I used the recipe:\n- 95% Safflower Oil\n- 5% Polysorbate 85\n\nThe Safflower oil seems to have a similar viscosity to the sunflower oil. but feels slightly 'oilier' than the sunflower oil did. It still washes off just as well. \n\nIn the future I have plans to experiment with mixing multiple oils, and to make a cleansing balm as well!\n\nI am definitely a complete newbie at this, so if you have any feedback or advice I would be happy to hear it.",

Canola oil is mustard oil which doesn't have smell and taste, but since it's imported, it's expensive. Olive oil is also very expensive. \n\nGroundnut oil is pretty decent. \n\nCoconut oil is very good. All the bad things you have read about coconut oil are not backed by any double blind studies. Parachute Coconut Oil is very expensive. You can find 1 liter packets of Coconut Oil much cheaper in Kerala stores or other South indian Stores in your locality (if you don't live in Kerala, TN, that is). Ghee and butter are also not unhealthy.\n\nRice bran is also decent and reasonably priced.   \n\nOne of the things to do is not to fry with the same oil multiple times. Use it a couple of times at most.   \n\nPersonally, I don't like Soya because Soya contains something very similar to hormones. No idea about Soya oil though.\n\nAnother thing is how oils are extracted. Cold pressed is very good but expensive. But hot pressed and chemically extracted are not as healthy but more common because they give far more output.  \n\nIMHO, one should worry far far far far more about carbohydrates than fat.",

    "body": "This review is about a relatively newer brand called Skin Need. I believe it is a Hong Kong brand, although a bit confusing because their products say they are \"Made in California\". It's one of those clean, cruelty-free, green/sustainable type brands which advertises on being simple and straightforward. Supposed to be great for sensitive skin types. Back in September 2021 I made the plunge and ordered a bunch of their things-- and honestly have been ordering from them almost every sale ever since! I get my stuff from another site called Woke Up Like This (WULT Beauty), which also makes their own make-up and products, but I believe they are the only distributor that will ship to the US from Asia. \n\nJust a little bit about my skin: I'm a longtime acne sufferer, in my 30s and still getting acne (although thankfully \\*KNOCK ON WOOD\\* not the cystic breakouts of my teens and 20s). My skin now is still pretty oily and plagued by sebaceous filaments, large pores, and even sebaceous cysts. I believe I'm an \"oily, dehydrated\" though, so my skin is also dry. Getting into my 30s, I also have some fine lines appearing and dryness on my cheeks. It's my T-zone (chin, nose and forehead) that remain the oiliest.\n\nWhat I tend to look for in my skincare: fungal acne safe (aiming for 100% FA safe!), fragrance-free, and simple ingredients. Pretty recently (November 2021), I've been cutting out all actives and just trying out the \"repair my skin barrier\" thing, so the main things I look for are moisturization.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[My most recent haul - I'm only reviewing the Skin Need stuff! ](https://preview.redd.it/ttvvpq5x7sb81.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c569e44363f3277d2964eb8d89d8bdc0880e2747)\n\nWithout further ado, here are my thoughts on all the products I've bought/tried so far. I tried to include some photos of the products but I didn't really think I was going to post or review at first, so they are limited!\n\n**Intense Nano-Lift Peptides** **Serum.** I only ordered 1 bottle of this, 40ml, which lasted about 1-month or so. The serum claims to help to lift and firm the skin, good for all skin types, and focus is on lines. The serum comes out a white and cloudy, opaque. Not tacky and absorbs fast. It's a bit runny, so either drop it into your palm and then smooth over the face or rub quickly to prevent dripping. 3-4 drops was enough to cover face and neck! I really liked how this serum helped to calm my redness and helped with moisture. This is probably the biggest benefit I saw to reduce lines-- I look older when I'm dehydrated and this serum helped to stabilize my skin. Even if I was breaking out, the acne was just more calm and healed much quicker for me while using this. I can't say I can speak for improving lines- my expression lines on the forehead and around the eyes when I smile are still there when I am smiling. I always consider serums targeting lines is more for prevention, and since I only had 1-mo of it, not sure I can really comment on it!\n\n>Ingredients: Argireline, Pentapeptides, Resveratrol, Marine Kelp Extract, Eternity Grass Extract, Nano Hyaluronic Acid, High Molecular Weight Sodium Hyaluronate. Ethylhexylglycerin, DI Water. \n\n**S-cell Power** **Serum.** I also only had a 40ml bottle of this, so my trial of it only lasted for a month or so. This is also thin, white/opaque. It was less runny than the Intense Nano-Lift Peptides though, and still 3-4 drops is enough for the whole face. This serum is meant to target dull and stressed skin, with a focus on collagen repair. I used this, along with the KGF serum after a microneedling session. I feel that it helped a with healing and calming down redness in the recovery days, and overall has helped to minimize the appearance of my pores. I can't comment on the anti-aging aspect so quickly but I am a fan of the serum and will be repurchasing. You can all check on me when I'm 40 to see if I look younger than my age! \n\n>Ingredients:  Swiss Apple Stem Cell Extract, Partridge Berry Stem Cell Extract, Geranylgeranylacetone, Nano-Hyaluronic Acid, High Molecular Weight Sodium Hyaluronate. Ethylhexylglycerin, DI Water. \n\n**100% Hyaluronic Acid +KGF** **serum**. I was using this serum at the same time as the S-cell Power serum, so all of my comments on it's effects are the same as above. The focus of this serum is on repair, and is advertised to be used after procedures to boost healing. This serum is clear and more like your usual hyaluronic acid serums, a bit thicker but absolutely not tacky at all! Dries super smooth and I usually do about 4-5 drops to cover my whole face and neck. I actually went back and bought 2-more of these during their Thanksgiving sale in November and will continue to use it. \n\nI recently got a microneedling session done again this week and will only have the KGF serum (ran out of the S-cell Power serum already), so I'll try to update back on it later this month on how the KGF is helping by itself! \n\n> Ingredients: Keratinocyte Growth Factor, Palmitoyl Tripeptide, Beta Glucan, Nano Hyaluronic Acid, High Molecular Weight Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin, DI Water. \n\nThe one nice thing about all of the serums above is that they are **all fungal acne safe**! Or at least based on their listed/posted ingredients they are. I'm going to try their HA+B5 serum next, and right now just at a loss of how to decide between all of them. I want to use them all every day! But trying to use 4 different serums all at once, in addition to the rest of the skincare routine, is crazy. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[I do enjoy the airless pump bottle! ](https://preview.redd.it/9k9cut07asb81.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c09a17efe10ea2b0d6b164bdea3b3d7139301e5)\n\n**XX The Signal** **Moisturizer.** I bought this more because it came as a part of a package during one of their sales. This moisturizer is **not** fungal acne safe. I did give it a try a couple times on the face but I think it immediately made my skin oilier, bumpier, and started to get more acne spots again. I stopped  it in about 2 weeks, and then tried to give it a try around my eyes as an eye cream, which has been fine. This probably has less to do with the moisturizer and more because I deal with fungal acne. It is moisturizing and I feel like it can help with fine lines. It is pretty thin, more lotion than cream. It also melts down, absorbs rather fast, and doesn't leave a film over the face. There is no real fragrance to it. It's moisturizing ability is equivalent to the Cerave cream.\n\n>Ingredients:  Mexican Wild Yam Extract, Argireline, Pentapeptides, Lotus Flower Extract, Persian Rose Extract, French Lavender Hydrosol, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Citrus Glauca Extract, Acacia Fruit Extract, Kukui Nut Oil, Rosewood Essential Oil, Olive Extract \n\nI still have yet to try their squalane oil and their Hydra Smooth Essence Moisturizer. I am a little cautious though, when you run the ingredients of the Hydra Smooth Essence Moisturizer through any of the fungal acne checkers -- it'll say fungal acne safe, but that's because they list it as \"rice bran extract\" instead of \"rice bran oil\". Not quite sure if I'm willing to risk trying this one yet! \n\n**Overall impression**: I super like this brand, mostly for their serums since not every item of theirs is fungal acne safe. I do feel that my skin is more stable since starting on their products. I think for those with less sensitive needs than me, you'll have no problem investing in an entire routine from them! It does have a very \"instagram clout\" type of feel to it though, and there aren't a lot of other reviews in English available. Make of that what you will! \n\nIf you're ordering from WULT to USA, it can be a little costly. Since they're shipping from Hong Kong, and due to recent COVID-19 issues, the only option is DHL ($$$). Shipping on average is about $200HKD ($25 USD). If you're ordering during sales + plus the shipping costs, it comes out to about $40 per item, which is no Timeless Skin Care sale but it's not like a Tatcha or Lancome type of $$$ either. Their customer service is amazing though, super responsive on both Instagram and through Whatsapp. I'm dreaming that one day they'll have free shipping for us international customers! \n\nI am a bit confused by their \"Made in California\" claim. Does this mean I'm paying for a product that is made in the state I live in, to be shipped to Hong Kong, just to get shipped back to me? Lol, I almost want to ask if there is a way I can cut the middle man and just get it from the warehouse in California.",

This collaboration partnership has really blossomed into something special in 2019. The strengths of each artisan are leveraged to spoil the wet shaving hobbyist community with the riches of their labor. Carnivale will be available this week at Maggard Razors ([www.maggardrazors.com](http://www.maggardrazors.com/)) and Beard & Blade Supply Co. ([https://www.beardandblade.com.au/](https://www.beardandblade.com.au/)).\n\nCarnivale is the story of festivals and celebrations that occur during the cool months of autumn. The story unfolds with gradual changing of temperature as well as vegetation. Scent notes of: Apricot, Muscatel, Plum, Amalfi Lemon, Spice, Brandy, Fig, Mahogany, Dried Apricot, Blackcurrant, Jazz Cabbage, Amber, Sandalwood, Cedarwoods, Ho Wood, Vetiver and Bourbon Vanilla make for a complex and refined fragrance. This is a warm scent of spices, fall fruits and resinous tones. Mrs. Ruds enjoys this scent for casual wear, like sitting by the firepit. Strength of scent is mid-strong from the container and for the shave’s duration. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Ariana & Evans Asian Plum as a comparable scent profile.\n\nStorybook Soapworks uses a tallow based soap featuring listed ingredients of: Stearic Acid, Water, Beef Tallow, Potassium Hydroxide, Castor Oil, Coconut Oil, Fragrance, Shea Butter, Vegetable Glycerin, Rice Bran Oil, Avocado Oil, Apricot Kernel Oil, Sodium Lactate, Tocopherol. The soap is soft and therefore care should be taken to ensure it is not overloaded. The soap is of above average thirst, but not the thirstiest soap out there. When properly hydrated and dialed in, the resulting lather will display the consistency of sour cream. Both primary and residual slickness are very good. While short of the upper tier soaps in terms of slickness, it gets the job done without any problems. Post shave is protective and nourishing to the skin. The post shave, like the slickness is very good. Storybook Soapworks soap base is more than a serviceable base in terms of performance and as such receives a ShaveScore of 88. For similar performance in a soap base, I suggest: Purely Skinful Handmade Essentials and Stubble Buster.\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Australian Private Reserve/Storybook Soapworks Carnivale (promotional gift)\n* Brush - Mozingo Brushworks “Pure” (gift)\n* Razor - Razorock Echo (loaner)\n* Post - Maol Grooming Authors Ridge (promotional gift)",

If Linoleic acid is the problem, then Grapeseed oil, Sunflower oil, Corn oil, and Soybean oil are the worst ones you can consume, while Canola oil, Peanut oil, and Rice Bran oil are not that bad, and the best oils on paper would be Avocado oil, Olive oil, and surprisingly, Palm oil. Palm oil actually has the lowest Linoleic acid content of any commonly used oil. What are your thoughts on this? I'm looking to have a scientific discussion here.

    "body": "Hey everybody! I've been a big lurker of this community for about a year, and definitely new to indie scents. I've purchased 6 deathandfloral scents less than a month ago, and have nothing to do right now, so decided to review. I know this shop is getting a lot reviews, so I'm sure many of you have gotten insights on scents already, but more of it isn't gonna hurt anybody, right?\n\nThe title says this is my first indie purchase, but in reality it's my second. I didn't have much success with my actual first indie purchase..like at all. The scents have been aging for a year now, so they're in their true form now and I'm still not a fan. But, the owner was nice and everybody's mileage varies! I'm glad I've ventured out and tried out D&F even though I was disappointed with my first ever indie purchase; d&f has really exceeded my expectation.\n\nso enough with the babbling, **HERE are six D&F reviews:**\n\n***Disclaimer:*** *I'm not the best at describing notes, as I don't have much experience with perfume notes in general.*\n\n**The sweater we buried you with is hanging in my closet** (*A luscious blend of three different vanillas, resinous amber, Arabian sandalwood, a soft cashmere sweater)*\n\n**TL;DR:** love it, leans to masc. would be great for me if layered with something more feminine. **9.5/10**\n\noh yeah, this is a very unisex scent. it definitely leans to masc, but I could see myself wearing this. it's VERY well blended, but like, I could tell that each note is there. the owner, Brim also gave me a free EDP sample of this, because all of a sudden I couldn't smell this scent anymore, so she wanted to make sure if I was just anosmic to the oil format, (she's such a sweetheart wtf???) but in reality it was because I had covid19. It's okay though, that was weeks ago, and I recovered. The EDP format is not at all like the oil (in my opinion), it's more... cold? but warm at the same time? the oil is way more of a 'musky' warm cozy scent in my opinion. I'm not sure what notes are making it that way, but I prefer the oil format. I also think this is better for my brother and dad, and not me unless I layer this with something a bit more feminine.\n\n**Swamp elixir** (*Soft honeysuckle and mossy oak trees, blended with water lilies and sparkling pink lemonade)*\n\n**TL;DR:** nostalgic. love this, truly reminds me of the south. don't expect a swamp outdoorsy green scent, in my opinion it's more of what you would be smelling around you in a swamp. **10/10**\n\nokay so I have no idea what notes I'm smelling, but if I could take a wild guess... the honeysuckle and sparkling pink lemonade is the most prominent. at first sniff, I couldn't pinpoint why it smells nostalgic, but it definitely smells like how Florida smelled to me when I lived there as child for a few years. The weird thing is, I don't remember sitting down in a swamp sipping on pink lemonade while I take whiffs of soft honeysuckles in the air... lol. would also love to see how this works as an EDP.\n\n**The soft crunch of bread and bone**  *(Flakey coconut French Madelines, stifling bakery air, vanilla cremé and crunchy macarons, the last sip of green tea with a mysterious lover)*\n\n**TL;DR:** yep. smells like a madeline lol but would love this as a room spray **9/10**\n\nif you've been trying to smell like a madeline, this is your chance. i don't really smell anything else, but after resting for quite a while now, i think the green tea kinda stopped being shy and is coming out of its shell now. very well-rounded, perfect for gourmand lovers. but definitely wouldn't wear this on myself. would love my room to smell like this!\n\n**The library, burning down with us**  (*Burnt edges of books, the overpowering scent of gasoline wafting around the wooden banister, wax candles melting on a desk)*\n\n**TL;DR:** love, love this. perfect if you want a book / gasoline atmospheric scent. **10/10**\n\nat first sniff, I didn't really enjoy this. I put it on my brother, and I actually did enjoy it! Now, alone, when sniffing out of the bottle, it's great and is accurate to the notes in my opinion. The gasoline isn't overpowering, unlike the description suggests. Which I like, because to me this makes it more well rounded and chance for other notes to pop out. ALSO, you know that one movie where it takes place in a library and a young boy hangs around there and the books start to come to life?? OH YEAH, *The Pagemaster.* That movie is sooo nostalgic to me and I feel like if this movie had a scent, it would kind of be this. Would also love to see someone's insight on this in EDP format!\n\n**FREEBIES:**\n\n**That first morning moment** (*Cozy blend of lavender and chamomile tea, with notes of white amber and soft cotton)*\n\n**TL;DR:** soapy lavender at first sniff. when rested, lavender but... well rounded? **5/10**\n\nI was so excited for this, I was initially going to buy this as a sample, but instead received this as a freebie. The notes and the name, sounds exactly like something I would go for, however it's definitely one of my least favorites of the bunch. At first sniff, it was completely soapy lavender, so I let this rest and well, I can't smell anything other than lavender. It's definitely probably just my nose though. After resting, I could see this working out for someone who would want a simple cozy lavender smell. Not for me though.\n\n**Nobody's happy in a poodle skirt** *(Soft pillowy cotton candy and spring flowers, a field of luscious painted lavender, the scent of a town both pleasant and eerie)*\n\n**TL;DR:** no idea what notes i'm smelling, so I guess it's super well blended. super strong and lingers longer than the other scents. might be a pro or con depending if you like this one or not. it's a con for me. **5/10**\n\nI had a gut feeling I wasn't going to like this because of the entire vibe it has. It was really bad at first sniff, like a 0/10. Resting it for a while gave it a more balanced aroma. I could see where ''pleasant and eerie'' comes in. It definitely has a sweet punch, which I think is the cotton candy. Sometimes the smell is...indescribably not good... but at other times it's kind of pleasant? On me, it's strong, and lasts for a long time. To really give you an insight on how strong the scent is, the box where I keep the samples now reeks completely of this scent. Although not for me, I could see this working out for someone who loves unique and unexpectable atmospherics.\n\n**packaging:** everything was received perfectly and in a good time-frame. there were no leakages thankfully! one problem I have is with the sample bottles. I love the idea, but after a while some of the samples get super hard to open. It takes me a minute to open some of them. perhaps I'm closing too tight? also, the wrapper or... i don't know what's called. the swirly string cushion around the cap when you open it? some of them became stringy and kind of fell apart outside of the cap which sometimes allows it to leak after. I have no idea if that made sense to anyone.  **9/10**\n\n**other notes:** The reason why almost all my reviews of the samples don't include 'on my skin' sections is because, well on my skin they all equally smell the same on my skin as as in the bottle. other than 'nobody's happy', all of them don't last as long too. it's probably because the rice bran oil, but I see that Brim's now switching to FCO, so I love that! also, to future buyers: please let these scents rest. you're probably super excited like i was to just sniff them all at the same time straight out of the mail, but it will make you nauseous! for some reason, 'the sweater' was the only one that smelled perfect out of the mail, as if it has already rested.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthank you for anyone who has read! <3 or anybody who skimmed through, (because me too lol). i know this was so long, I thought I would keep it short and simple... guess not. i'm excited to try out more of D&F. the seller is the sweetest, and all the perfumes had its own experience. **scents i'm wanting to try out:** I was born a bitch, Nothing Rusts, Two cups of tea, Half-hoping to be eaten, Lay me in the earth.",

(I do have reasonably soft water.) I was surprised enough that I went to the site and noted the ingredients:\n\n>Ingredients : Stearic Acid, Glycerin, Coconut Oil, Palm Oil, Rice Bran Oil, Fragrance.     \n>May contain : Sunflower Oil (Used as a substitute for Rice Bran Oil when needed).\n\nThe sampler pack (four 2-oz bars for $8) is a good way to try it out. I was quite pleased.\n\nThey quote me (in rather large type) from an earlier review of their Black Tie fragrance, which was rather muted, but I've been told the fragrances have been pumped up a bit since then. The fragrance this morning was very pleasant: more noticeable, but not too strong. (They also make an unscented version.)\n\nJust to be clear: there's no funny business here. I buy the soaps like any other customer, and we have no relationship other than as vendor and customer. They quoted me just because I liked the first bar I tried, but this morning I had one of those \"gradual awareness\" things in which I realized that this really was something special (thus my peek at the ingredients).\n\nWell worth a try, and the Strop Shoppe club lets you sign up to receive one soap a month for a year, either a full-size puck or a 2-oz sample. The sample is a good size, and probably would last a month, though I've not tried that. \n\nI did the usual: holding the sample puck in left hand, brushed it briskly, firmly, and at length so the brush was fully loaded, brought it to my (wet, washed) beard and worked the lather up, and said, \"Holy moly!\"",

    "body": "[Album here](http://imgur.com/a/dx3JI). I've decided to share some of my soaping adventures from this year. Each batch is a different scent, colour and recipe. I've made plenty of mistakes, luckily though pretty much all of them are just cosmetic. I thought I'd share so others can learn from my mistakes!\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nLime, cedarwood, patchouli and oakmoss. Coloured with chromium dioxide and olive green clay. I love the scent in this one, it's the one I'm the most proud of and that garners the best reactions from people.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nPeppermint, with a small amount of rosemary. Coloured with titanium dioxide and ultramarine. You can see I didn't mix the ultramarine into the oil correctly before mixing it into the soap batter. Recipe included 20% sunflower oil, which though mild, made the texture of the soap a little \"slimy\" in my opinion.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nLilac and vanilla, my wife chose the scent for this, it smells great. Coloured with titanium dioxide and ultramarine. This one suffers from glycerin rivers, which are the ugly clear areas in the soap, that are a cosmetic issue. Apparently this can be avoided in the future by using less titanium dioxide, using a water discount and/or keeping the temperature down after pouring into the mould. I stopped insulating my soaps after this one.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nBergamot, cedarwood and clary sage. Coloured with chromium dioxide and activated charcoal. This is the first \"in the pot\" swirl I tried, all the others were done in the mould. Also the first soap I've made with rice bran oil, so I'm looking forward to this one to finish curing so I can use it.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSandalwood, coffee and benzoin. Coloured with French green clay an Australian red clay. The green is very pale, in the future I might just use the red clay if I make this one again.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nLemon, rose, rose geranium and ylang ylang. Coloured with blue ultramarine, Australia red clay and activated charcoal. Not the best colour choice for a lemon/floral scent, but I wanted to see how they worked together. You can also see I didn't get the titanium dioxide fine enough before mixing into the soap batter. I used the TD so the blue and red didn't go green and orange. I also made the mistake of putting the TD in the batter that was going to have the charcoal in it so it wen grey instead of black.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nOrange, petitgrain, vetiver, black pepper and benzoin. Coloured with a little bit of titanium dioxide just to help the orange of the essential oil and some brown sugar on top. I was going to mix the brown sugar through the batter as an exfoliant but I forgot. You can see a partial gel in this one, so I should have either insulated it somewhere warm or put it in the fridge over night. My second favourite scent, smells just like standing among orange trees. Inspired by the Terre D'Hermes EDT.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThe hot process shaving soap has the same scent as the green lime soap at the top. No olive oil or clay is used in my shaving soap. The recipe is tallow free but does include lanolin so it's not vegan.",

    "body": "I've been experiencing diffuse hair loss since 2020. Not caused by traction alopecia, acute stress, medication, diet, etc (I've experimented with all variables and nada). \n\n**What I've tried:** \n\n* I've tried vivascal but realized it was giving me anxiety and irritability because synthetic B vitamins can do that to some people, and I am one of those people. \n* Tried minoxil and other similar varieties but never stuck with it for more than maybe 2 months because I barely noticed a decrease in shedding and was just really freaked out about the potential side effects. Apparently the main ingredient degrades collagen! Also I didn't apply it 2x daily because then my hair would get super greasy quickly, and just look terrible. And my whole goal is to have nice hair? Just didn't make sense. And it's expensive. Plus I have a cat. \n* Tried Nioxin, went through a large bottle of it. Pretty sure it's just minoxil plus some extra stuff so I was still suspicious about using it.Helped a little bit. But the mile long ingredient list full of parabens and things are questionable for our bodies/environment. I know people say parabens are fine, but I personally would rather just avoid them if I don't absolutely need them. To each their own!\n* Tried other natural type stuff that had some evidence backed ingredients and did feel like there was a slight reduction in shedding but nothing crazy and they were super expensive. \n\nI can always feel when a major shed is going to happen because I get this weird mild pain on my scalp and the more I get it the crazier the shedding is and the bigger the hair clumps are in the shower. At first I did rosemary hair treatments intermittently and didn't think much of it (mixed it in with my conditioner at first). Around September I created a special blend of oils that all were supposed to help in some way, and I started applying it whenever the scalp sensation began hoping to prevent the subsequent mass casualties. And quickly the sensation went away and I didn't notice a huge amount of loss the next shower. That motivated me to really give this rosemary hair stuff a go...and the results of been magic! M-A-G-I-C!!!!\n\n* I mix jojoba oil, neem oil and hemp seed oil and highly recommend this combination of carrier oils. They're super viscous so they wash out relatively easily, don't seem to clog pores (I'm pretty sensitive) and each on their own has hair growth benefits. Plus they mix with the essential oils much better than castor oil or coconut oil (which are also impossible to wash out of my hair in a single shower). \n*  I usually do an equal blend of each oil. I bought good quality versions of each, getting glass bottles when I could, and it works out to about $12/month to really saturate my scalp 4x/week. If you want to make it even more cost effective you can also add rice bran oil which probably won't change the effectiveness since the rosemary oil is the true \"active\". Rice bran has the best fatty acid profile out of the \"seed oils\", and a few other benefits so this is why I suggest rice bran over other cheap cooking oils. Make sure all the oils are sold in dark bottles to decrease the chances that they're oxidized. \n* With the carrier oils  I add rosemary oil, peppermint oil, and camomile oil into an old Khiels magic hair elixer bottle. You'll want to have 1-2 drops of EO's per teaspoon of carrier oils since the EO's are irritating. I am pretty loose with things but the EO mixture is about an 7.5: 1.5: 1 ratio of rosemary: peppermint: chamomile oil. \n*  It's super important not to go overboard with the essential oils as you could end up damaging the barrier and having a whole hose of other issues to deal with. I heard of someone who got Seb Derm from applying straight essential oils to their scalp. I don't measure things out precisely, but I do error on the side of caution. If the mixture doesn't have a pronounced rosemary smell and doesn't feel at all \"fresh\" when you apply it, then you probably need a few more drops. If your scalp feels itchy or irritated after leaving it on for a few hours then you have to much EO's and should increase the carrier oils.  \n* I leave it on for anything from 1-6 hours depending on how long I am home for. I'll usually throw it in after work/class and leave it on until I go to sleep. If you need to run out of the house and don't want to rinse it out yet, just throw on an old baseball cap and put your hair in a low neat bun. People will just think it's wet.\n* I have very fine hair that gets oily fast so I usually will do two shampoos and this gets all of the oil out very easily. Sometimes if I want to be extra sure I will do 2x shampoo, and then use a gentle facewash on my bangs to really make sure that area is squeaky clean. \n* Also rosemary water WILL NOT WORK the same. The compound that makes rosemary effective is fat soluble, meaning water extraction methods won't contain it. \n\n**RESULTS:**\n\n* I should mention my hair grows extremely fast. Even throughout all of this it was still growing quickly, it was just falling out at a faster rate. I think this could be partially responsible for the quickness of my results.\n* I do it like 4x/ week and it is shocking how well it corresponds to a decrease in shedding. If I forget to do it for a week then I'm right back to the old shedding (and can feel that scalp sensation start to happen again). Literally a single use decreases the shedding by about 25%. I would say that with regular use my hairloss has decreased by 100%. Obviously I still lose hair in the shower because everyone does, but it's so minimal and it's basically the amount I would lose in highschool when I had zero issues with this.\n* My main issues were overall thinning. Loss of baby hairs. Receding hairline at the temples and sides of my forehead, my part was widening *a lot* and I straight up had a bald spot on the back of my head that looked like a comb over haha. My baby hairs are back and I can't remember a time when they were this numerous. The parts near my temples that began receding have come back, maybe not 100% back to its original location, but super close with so much baby hairs and increased density of the actual hairline as well. Even my mom noticed all the baby hairs in this area growing! \n* My part is almost, if not completely, back to its original size/density. \n* The bald spot in the back of my head is DRAMATICALLY reduced, I'd say by 90%. When it's not freshly washed and brushed, I can still see a teeny bit of scalp. But I think this is partly because of the way my hair parts, and also because I wasn't dilligently applying to this area until maybe 3.5 months ago. I mostly focused on the front and top of my head at first because it was easier to see. \n* I had a lot of thinning near my ears that was very noticeable when I'd put my hair in a ponytail. Loooots of scalp show. Now I have no scalp show and I even have these silly little pieces of hair growing out of that area that are too long to stay in my pony tail. I'm pretty sure I never had hair this long in that area. I also could never grow my hair past a few inches at the nap of my neck, so I started applying there too. I definitely think it's longer than it's every been! \n* Even though it's only been \\~6 months I swear the thickness throughout much of my length is super noticeable! I don't feel so stringy and stragly anymore. \n\n**TLDR:** Rosemary oil, peppermint and chamomile essential oil mixed with jojoba, neem and hemp seed oil is super cost effective, safer than most other options and is *insanely effective.* ",

I used to make my own cosmetics before Deciem and PC started to be available on my country and I used to buy a ton of cosmetics just because they were famous, pretty, or I just had an urge to buy... You get it. I accumulated a ton of ingredients and products that I didn't even use. After this sub opened my eyes, I'm now on beauty rehab, I gave away 90% of the stuff I had and didn't use so I'm here looking for help to build a stash of products that will help me and that are worth the money. No more buying just for the brand, popularity and what not for me anymore. This sub is absolutely amazing and I've learned so much, I owe you having opened my eyes to the real deal in skincare. Please help me!  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n**Concerns:**\n\n1. Gritty texture on my under eye area, since forever. \n2. Nose pores that permanently look dark and dirty. I oil cleanse, use BHA and green clay. But they're still like this. \n3. Pores on the skin surrounding the nose. \n4. Undereye dark shadows. I've never had them before, even in all the years I had insomnia. They suddenly appeared and I don't know what to do with them. They're by far the thing I can't stand the most. Going to get the veins zapped would be the best, right? :/\n\n[PHOTOS http://imgur.com/a/kwFW2] \n\n*As you can see by the photos, the problem area in my face is concentrated on the center (nose, skin surrounding the nose and under eye area).  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n**Skintype:**\n-Combination. Non sensitive.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Routine:** A month with these products but the routine has 3 years (Double cleanse, Essence, HA serum, Vit C serum, etc). And current products are working well and being accepted by my skin without problem.  \n\n \n1. Morning:\n-Wash face with Bioderma Micelar water\n-Niod Multi-molecular hyaluronic complex serum\n-The ordinary vitamin C in silicone suspension serum (hate the texture) \n-The Ordinary NMF\n-Bioderma Photoderm Max aquafluid spf 50\n***** when I don't go out I use Bella Aurora's intensive 24h moisturizer after NMF. \n\n\n2. Evening:\n-Wash face with DHC pore cleansing oil\n-Wash face with Bioderma micelar water\n-Suomay face cleansing device and then wash off micelar water. \n-The Ordinary buffet\n-The Ordinary 0,5% retinol in squalene\n-Apply homemade night mask with squalene, allantoin, rice bran oil, bisabobol and various vitamins 1 hour after retinol(need feedback on this. I don't know if this interferes with the retinol. I just apply it to avoid loosing all the retinol when my face touches the pillow)\n\n\n3. *******Ocassional:\n-I use The Ordinary 30%AHA 2%BHA once a week, I don't use retinol and vitamin C one day before and one day after using it. \n-Some nights (like just twice a month 😅) I also use a face mask so I don't apply retinol. I just go to sleep with the remaining face mask serum.  \n\n \n\n\n\n**Some info:**\n-I bought Blithe's vital treatment 8 nourishing beans essence and Tundra Chaga pressed serum, this last one I plan to use it as an overnight mask. I want to add another serum, I'm thinking on Niod's survival 30 or TO resveratrol one. Once I finish TO vitamin C serum I'll buy the Paula's Choice resist. I can't stand that gritty, slimy texture. Also, I won't repurchase the Bioderma and DHC products because they aren't cruelty free, so I'm on the look out for cf alternatives.  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n**Lastly:**\nI got some ingredients left that I rarely use but maybe I could include them on my routine in a mask/occlusive/directly applied on the face or something? I won't post them here to not make the post even longer but if someone wants to I can post them on the comments. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you!!!",

I am not as militant as most of you but avoid seed oils and other nasty food products as much as I can without damaging my enjoyment of life. \n\nI am in the process of opening a restaurant. My vision is using tallow for the deep fryers, avocado and local olive oil for everything else, but it is a partnership and I don't call all the shots. If it isn't financially feasible, we will have to look into other oil options.\n\nDo y'all have any thoughts on the \"least harmful\" commercially available cooking oils? Our chef wants to use rice bran oil or half tallow + half bran oil for the fryer, basically using the tallow for flavoring which feels like a rip off. I want to be prepared with other options if the math doesn't work in my favor and at the very least avoid oils processed using hexane etc. I also know there are some algae and mushroom oils coming out but that is very new science and not sure if it's financially any better.\n\nEdited to add: you can suggest any commercially available, affordable cooking oil option. Not just seed oils.",

It is very stable, and the purchase cost would be offset by not needing to change it nearly as frequently. Of course you’ll be testing your fat for breakdown, right? You’d quickly see that fats like soybean and rice bran oil break down very quickly and need to be changed frequently, while tallow and coconut do not. You’ll have to balance this fact with general need to change the fat, although good filtration goes a long way in extending lifespan of fat as well.",

Now that winter is coming to a close it's time for some tonics and elixirs to move us out of the sluggishness that winter can bring. Like last year, we opted for light Body Emulsion instead of Pumpkin Butter for this release. These will be great refreshingly light moisturizers to reach for during the summer months as well. \n\nAdditionally, Bathing Dust is back! We sold this product several years ago and had to discontinue due to a key component being unavailable and now it's back!

Although my omelettes have turned out really good, every piece of meat I tried to sear had not met my expectations until today.\n\nThe problem is the recipes I 'd read were calling for a *blazing hot* pan. Wrong. The blazing hot pan burned the tender outside layer of the steaks I had tried before.\n\nAlas. The solution was hidden in the \"Serious Eats\" site;\n\n> Place a heavy cast iron or stainless steel skillet with one tablespoon of vegetable, canola, or rice bran oil over the hottest burner you have and preheat the skillet until it starts to smoke.¹\n\nThat's it. I loaded my pan with two Tbs of quasi-Crisco as I didn't have any vegetable oil around, apart from EVOO which is a no-no for CI until it was smoking.\n\nPlaced the medium-rare sous vide rib in after seasoning it well - the steak, not the pan which had to be seasoned anyways - and followed the not-so-secret formula:\n\n     Drool = ( Flip + wait 20 secs ) × 10\n\nSigh.\n\n------\n\n¹ [The Food Lab's Complete Guide to Sous Vide Steak | Serious Eats](http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/06/food-lab-complete-guide-to-sous-vide-steak.html)\n\n[edit: spelling]",

        "body": "For rare to medium-rare steak I usually do as follows:\n\n* You'll want to get some decent quality thick steaks. The thicker the better as it will allow you to get a nice tasty sear on the steak without cooking it right through.\n* Leave the steak in the air (loosely covered) for about 20-30 minutes. This allows the steak to redden and to dry off a little on the outside, so you get that nice crust/sear and it doesn't boil from the juices. Also pat them dry if they are wet to the touch.\n* Put about 2-3 tablespoons of oil (corn, olive etc.) in a pan and heat until well smoking on a medium-high heat.\n* Season one side of each steak with loads of coarse sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.\n* Place the steaks seasoning side down, remembering to lay it down away from you to avoid splashing oil.\n* DON'T CROWD THE PAN! There should be *at least* an inch between each steak. If there's not, cook them in batches. If you crowd them, the liquid will leak and they'll start to stew instead of fry, ruining that nice sear.\n* Add a sprig of rosemary and some orange peel to the pan for flavour if you've got them. The oils from these will flavour the oil in the pan.\n* Cook each side until there is a nice sear, it should be mid-dark brown without being burnt, turning only once. (cook to your own preference)\n* Once cooked, take out of the pan and cover loosely with some foil.\n* At this point, you can turn off the heat of the pan and add a large knob of butter to it. Allow to melt and mix with the steak juices. Pour this over the steaks when serving.\n* Let them rest for at least a minute or two. This is important. It allows the meat fibres to relax again and take up their own juices meaning the steak will be juicer than if you cut it straight away.\n* Serve!",

It's just smooth. But after emulsification, I can really feel the gunks being removed\n\n\nOn my day 3, acne didn't flare up and also didn't experienced any irritation. Can't say for now if I'll buy it again. Pls share your experience as well ❤️",

But these recipes always list the same ingredients and they unfortunately don’t taste like recreations of the chicken at Chipotle. Chances are I’ve done more research than you so I’m hoping for someone who either knows the answer, or can shoot me in the face so I don’t have to live another day without the recipe. Or if you work at chipotle and can help me acquire the actual marinade, that’d be tight. I know that Chipotle uses chicken thighs, and that the marinade is not made in house - it is pre-made, bagged, and delivered. If you know what company does this, that’d also be helpful. \n\nCommon speculation: \n- red onion\n- garlic\n- chipotle peppers in adobo sauce\n- ancho chili powder \n- distilled vinegar \n- cumin, oregano, olive oil/rice bran oil, salt & pepp.",

Meanwhile, a product \"veggie crisps\" loaded with rice bran oil and high in vegetable fiber gets a 5 star rating.\n\nEven their *chocolate mud cake* gets a 2 star rating.\n\nFor context, this rating system isn't meant to be used comparatively across food categories, but only within their own category. In other words, a mud cake scoring 2/5 means it's healthier than some other cake that's only 1/5, and the veggie crisps are being compared to other 'snack foods' (which may include potato chips and some candy). Still, consumers don't tend to know this and it's horribly disingenuous. The companies don't even have to disclose the category of food being referenced. \n\nI don't know what category biltong fits into, but I can't imagine any scale where it could possibly be the worst nutritional choice.",

I’ve got a beautiful feelin’ everythin’s goin’ OUR way!\n\nI’m writing this in advance so I can post it super quick in my lunch break – if you can’t tell, I’ve just had my morning cappuccino and it is working!\n\nAh, Tuesday! I love Tuesdays because that’s when I see my PT, who is a really awesome source of support and encouragement for me. I didn’t work up much of a sweat this time round (just 4 sets of squats and ~ 90 seconds on the treadmill) but we had lots of chat around how to manage my calf, he filmed me on the treadmill to point out ways to work on my running technique, and he even lent me his calf compression sleeves to see if they help at all. I truly would not have made it this far without his support – Dane, you are absolutely The Man!\n\nSeeing as I’m on the topic of exercise, I skipped my usual Tuesday run and did 40 minutes of moderate cycling, followed up with calf raises on the smith machine. I’ve only been doing calf raises on leg day, but Dane said to do them at least 4 times a week, soooo I’ll be doing ALL the calf raises from now on! And I took the stairs :)\n\nCalories – not 100% sure really. Breakfast, lunch and snacks were fine, but not being able to run after work got me super frustrated and I really wanted to buy junk and shove it all in my face for dinner. I compromised by promising myself that if I got through my session I could buy dinner but it had to be a good choice. My gym has a café in it, and they have a salad bar, so I went there. OH MY GOODNESS it was the yummiest thing I’ve eaten in ages! Quinoa, kumara, spinach, broccoli, chicken with a drizzle of chimi churri dressing on top…I tried to guess quantities of everything + allowance for oil and came in around 550 calories, so 5660/5021kj for the day (~1350/1200). I did gym so I’m still at a reasonable deficit, but wooowzer it was just so yum. Thankfully the $14 price tag will keep me from going back too often!\n\nAlso, just for fun, I took pictures of my main meals today, just in case anyone needs a little inspiration for food! [This](https://imgur.com/FNsN4WR) was brekkie and lunch, and [here is dinner](https://imgur.com/HwNlEhA) :)\n\nBreakfast – 40g of oats and 100g of strawberries (175 calories). I also have a coffee as well (small trim cappuccino - 80 calories).\nLunch – 80g courgette, 80g broccoli, 35g tomatoes, 125g chicken breast, 175g pumpkin + a small spray of rice bran oil (260 calories).\nDinner – total guestimate as above, but went with 550 calories.\n\nDidn’t take pictures of the snacks – cruskits with vegemite, protein shake, half a brownie, plus a couple of black coffees. When I think about it, it’s probably the brownie that messed up the day. It was so deliciously fudgey though…and I only ate half, that counts for something right?!\n\nRight – now it’s your turn!\n\nKia kaha!\n\nLancey x\n",

Low on calories by design. 1600/1810.\n\nEdit: So night before yesterday we discovered the batteries on our scale were dying. We'd suddenly lost 10 lbs each: I went from 195ish to 185. Knowing that was impossible, we replaced them today. Suddenly I weighed 199.0lbs. I calibrated it using a 20lb dumbbell I had to make sure, so yeah. Rollercoaster. Not happy. It won't derail me, but it definitely changed my eating plans and made me look back at how I've been recording food. Have I gotten complacent? I'm not sure. Am I holding water? I'm not sure. In both cases, it's hard to know for sure. But I'm going to double down on attention to detail going forward this week and make sure the mistakes aren't repeated.\n\nEdit continued: It's also possible it's \"non-water weight.\" Since we've started this we've both been less regular and my work schedule is really, *really* poorly put together this year (there's nothing I can do about it except lodge a complaint, which I already have; two blocks of two and a half hours separated by a frantic 45 minute preparatory period is not good), and gives me little access to restrooms to follow the natural schedule. I have a feeling this is also a factor because, well, I usually wind up looking forward to the weekend, if you know what I mean. So I'm just going to have to be attentive to my own internal rhythm and do what I can.\n\nBut to hell with this today, and to hell with this week.

As promised, I’ve been patch testing/using it for more than 2 weeks now so I'm confident enough to give a short review.\n\n\nColor/Texture: It’s a clear oil and have a thick runny texture which makes it easier to spread and massage over face. \n\n\nSmell: It doesn’t have any smell at all. If you don’t like the deep version because of their strong orange fragrance, you should really give this a try.\n\n\nDoes it work well? On a daily basis, I only wear a cc cream and eyeliner and this removes these effortlessly. If you like the Deep version, this will work just as fine. Once I emulsify, it leaves my skin soft and clean.\n\n\nCOSDNA: If your skin reacts to the rice bran oil in the deep cleansing oil, you should also think about the speedy version because its ingredient list is much shorter without the rice bran oil and orange.\n\n\nPrice: It’s $10 for 250ml on Sasa.com so it’s very affordable for those who are interested in trying.\n\n**tl;dr: it's cheap, scentless, effective as a oil cleanser.**",

I would be 95% confident that they do not add the oil at that stage. If I had to guess they make plain rice in big rice cookers and then mix in oil and seasonings after.

Ive had recurring stomach aches and constipation for about 4 months now and in the last two weeks or so ive gotten rid of my constipation and stomach pains, with only bloating to go ( and its reducing). These episodes have occurred several times in my life. All for about the same amount of time.i saw 5 doctors this time, and finally worked it out!!\n\n\nIll try to summarise as best i can\n\n\nSaw a GP - told me to increase fibre and take coloxyl - resulted in either diarrhea from coloxyl, or bloating, gnawing pain and constipation from anything i ate. \n\n\nSaw a Gastroentorologist - performed an endoscopy + colonscopy -  Suggestion that it was gastritis and gave me PPI'S and recommended low fodmaps. Result- low fodmap basically jammed me up more, and i started going pale, ppi's made my stomach ache worse. \n\n\nSaw an allergy doctor - scratch test revealed a few allergies. I avoided these foods. Result - mix between constipation and diarrhoea, pain persisting. ( no real change)\n\n\nWent to a nutritionist because i was clearly not doing the diet right. She suggested..... low fodmap. I did it but with some suggested changes. Back to being pale and jammed up. Id lost about 8kg by this point (which was kinda good, i was about 82kg and am now 75ish, which is good for my height).\n\n\nIt was at this point i reverted to an old diet that kind of worked before. I was literally only eating steamed broccoli, sweet potato and carrot. It started to work but was not sustainable.so i thought id roast the same veggies.\n\n\nI roasted them, ate them,then curled in a ball from the incredible pain.  It was the fucking rice bran oil i was using in my cooking all along...... i switched to olive oil and....no pain.\n\n\nNow i had a new issue, my stomach was clearly damaged. Desperate, i went to a naturopath my parents suggested. She sat with me for 2 HOURS, and went through every gastroentorology report, \n\n\nExplaining that i had an inflammed oesophagus stomach and duodenum. She prescribed an antihistmine diet, some nutrilife \"gut releif\" which puts a layer over your oesophagus and stomach, which i needed because i was passing mucus at this point, and then a tablet for liver function. The powder had almost an instant impact, and for the first week or so, if i broke the diet and had pain i took an enema to help me pass stools. After the first few days i was going fine. Now they're type 4's and easy to pass.\n\n\n2 weeks on and im back to normal. I have a bit of bloating but that is slowly going.\n\n\nI realise this isnt super scientific, but 3 weeks ago i was a hopeless, distressed mess so i wanted to share this in case it helps someone else. \n\n\nAll the best to each and every one of you.",

Bue Bang 3 CMU and Bue Bang 4 CMU on Melanin Production, Nitric Oxide Secretion, and Steroid 5α-Reductase Inhibition.\n\nAlopecia and gray hair are common hair abnormalities affecting physical appearance and causing psychological problems. \n\nChemical treatments partially restore hair disorders but have distressing side effects. \n\nBioactive plant compounds constitute promising sources of potential medicinal substances instead of chemical agents, producing high side effects. In this study, we focused on the waste of local rice cultivars: Bue Bang 3 CMU (BB3CMU) and Bue Bang 4 CMU (BB4CMU) from the north of Thailand. \n\nThe rice bran oil (RBO), defatted rice bran extract (DFRB), and rice husk (H) were determined for in vitro hair revitalization in melanin production, nitric oxide (NO) secretion, and steroid 5α-reductase inhibition. \n\nThe results indicated that BB4CMU-RBO with high contents of iron, zinc, and free fatty acids showed a comparable induction of melanin production on melanocytes (130.18 ± 9.13% of control) to the standard drug theophylline with no significant difference ( p > 0.05). \n\nThis promising melanin induction could be related to activating the NO secretion pathway, with the NO secretion level at 1.43 ± 0.05 µM. \n\nIn addition, BB4CMU-RBO illustrated a significant inhibitory effect on both steroid 5α-reductase genes ( SRD5A ) type 1 and type 2, which relates to its primary source of tocopherols. \n\nHence, rice bran oil from the Thai rice variety BB4CMU could be applied as a promising hair revitalizing candidate, from natural resources, to help promote hair growth and re-pigmentation effects.\n\n[Read the Full Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9921347/)",

    "body": "Hi everyone! It's been a while since I've used up a bunch of products, so here we go. These are products that haven't been reviewed here before (as far as I know), so hopefully contributing to the database ;)\n\n**Skin type**: combination/oily (after I stopped my birth control, my oil slick teenage skin came back with a vengeance. It's taken 5 months for it to normalize, but I still get the monthly mild breakout around my period).\n\n**Age**: early 30\n\n**Climate**: dry, desert, subtropical - this means winter is mild, summer is hot, but the lack of humidity year-round definitely doesn't help my skin\n\n**Other products use**: Glossier cleansing milk, HABA squalane II (plant based), Komeyu rice bran oil, Melano CC (morning), HABA White Lady (night), salicylic acid, lactic acid & mandelic acid every few days depending on day of the monthly cycle.\n\n**1.** **DHC Urumai Lotion** (toner)\n\n* Ingredients: [cosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_a46b400947.html). I glanced at their Japanese site ingredient list, and the cosDNA listing seems accurate. To note, my Japanese is pretty elementary. Regardless, I was on a hunt for rice bran (oryza sativa) extract and came across the DHC Urumai line. There's not a whole lot of info on this line in the English-speaking world, but DHC seems to be reliable enough so I bit the bullet. \n* Price range: bought on Alphabeauty for \\~$20; definitely not cheap, considering the volume was 145 ml. I finished it in 4 months with once a day use.\n* Likes: scentless, gentle, fairly hydrating, no breakout trigger. My skin is NOT dry, so this lotion would be suitable for oily or combination skin. \n* Dislikes: fairly expensive for the price and quality - it was gentle, but nothing too amazing. No change in skin condition, but I guess at least it didn't break me out.\n* Also consider: HABA VC lotion, which, despite being more expensive and only 35 ml more, lasts me way longer (more hydration per ml of product), Derizum deep lotion (unfortunately I used it and then had a breakout, which I suspect to be hormonal, but I've been so scarred so I can't personally vouch for it). Both of these lotions are gentle, scentless, and more hydrating than the DHC Urumai.\n\n**2.  DHC Urumai Milky Essence** (emulsion)\n\n* Ingredients: [cosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_321f430399.html). As with the lotion, ingredients look pretty good on cosDNA analysis. Rice bran extract is also a featured ingredient, as with other products from this line.\n* Price range: bought on Alphabeauty for \\~$30 (50 ml). Mid-range. Finished it in 5 months with once a day use. Definitely lasts for more than I expected, as the bottle didn't look very substantial.\n* Likes: same as the lotion - scentless, gentle, good ingredient list, no breakout trigger, just enough hydration. I really like how the degree of moisture is just enough for me. Even if I put on another sunscreen layer, it isn't shiny or oily, which is super important on days when my skin seems to be good at nothing but producing more oil. It's the perfect emulsion for my day time need.\n* Dislikes: none! I very much enjoyed using this emulsion and will repurchase.\n* Also consider: Kose Sekkisei emulsion (similar degree of hydration but with a - depending on your perspective - persistently lingering scent), actually is cheaper ml for ml ($50 for 140 ml here in US). \n\n**3. Shiseido Aqualabel Oil-in Gel**\n\n* Ingredients: [Ratzillacosme](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/skin/aqualabel-special-gel-cream-a-oil-in/). Marketed as for dry & ageing skin. I only use it for night time.\n* Price range: bought on ebay for $25 (90 g, substantial jar). Finished in 5 months with once a day use, but I put a ton on at night as I don't care about the shine, plus I feel like on days with acid layering, I just need that extra layer of occlusion/moisture.\n* Texture/experience: has little beads that remind me of the Innisfree green tea sleeping pack. Flowery scent.\n* Likes: pretty hydrating, especially if layered on top of lotion (toner) and oil. If used alone, not occlusive enough/will evaporate throughout the night. No breakout trigger. Face feels smooth when waking up. Decent sleeping pack for the price.\n* Dislikes: the scent. I go back and forth between enjoying scented products (aka the Kose Sekkisei lotion) and wanting to use non-scented products only. Regardless, it has a pretty strong flowery smell, similar to the Innisfree sleeping pack (feels more hydrating than the Innisfree though). \n* Also consider: Innisfree green tea sleeping pack, Gekka sleeping pack (very mild scent, I enjoyed it)\n\n**4. Tunemakers moisturizing cream**\n\n* Ingredients: [cosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_20d5430400.html). I typed this into cosDNA from the label (in English). Note that sometimes the English translation of ingredients may not be the exact same as the Japanese (looked on the Japanese website of Tunemakers but couldn't find their ingredient list).\n* Price range: bought on It's Apricot, a local California retailer, for $30 (50 g) but they seem to be out of business/closed; their website isn't working any more. Finished in 4 months with daily use.\n* Likes: gentle, occlusive, no break out, no scent, appropriate for both day and night use. I've really enjoyed both of Tunemakers lotions before (both the high moisture creamy one and the light one) and can always count on them being scentless and gentle. I bought this cream mainly for after procedure use (had 3 sessions of Vbeam lasers that finally took care of my telangiectasia (broken blood vessels) I've had since I was 14. If you have this same condition, I would recommend a laser procedure. Skin care products unfortunately have never worked for me).\n* Dislikes: the packaging is terrible. Though housed in a light protective amber jar, the jar is tall and thin, making reaching in to scoop the cream a pain in the behind.\n* Also consider: nothing Asian skin care comes to mind immediately, but it reminds me of the boring drugstore beauty products like Vanicream or CeraVe.

I live streamed it, so you'll hear me occasionally responding to people during.\n\nI'm having lots of fun with this design technique, but it requires a really thin trace to get the best results. \n\nFew tips:\n\n I'm using full liquid - 1:1 lye/water, with goat's milk to make up the difference. I stick blend the goat milk into the oils first to start the emulsion, then add the lye and stick blend briefly. (Not in the video - I mix in my laundry sink and it's a bit hard to show). Stick blend in the titanium dioxide so I don't get flecks.\n\nThen I switch to hand stirring. So it's probably no more than 60 seconds of stick blending, just enough to get a stable emulsion.\n\nIf you want to use my recipe, it's a modified version of one of my usual recipes, designed to be slow moving.\n\n* 42% Olive Oil\n* 20% Rice Bran Oil\n* 20% Coconut Oil\n* 10% Sweet Almond Oil\n* 8% Castor Oil\n\nPlus Sodium Lactate, whatever colourant you're using, already dispersed (I dispersed in Sweet Almond Oil), Goat Milk (or straight water, whatever), and fragrance. I used Lemon Myrtle Essential Oil for this one. \n\nThese soaps will get a full 7-8 week cure before I sell them. \n\nAny questions, let me know! [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/yAjcxiM.jpg) a soap I made with the same technique, just using blue mica instead of gold.",

    "body": "Mickey Lee Soapworks Bodhisattva is their flagship vegan soap. Currently, this is the only offering in their vegan  line up. I believe they are working on future vegan offerings based on feedback they receive from the performance of this soap offering. It can be purchased directly from their [website](http://www.mickeyleesoapworks.com/shop/bodhisattva).  \n  \nAs always, I will provide my complete honest review and I have not received any compensation or preferential treatment for my review. This is strictly for the community to use as a tool in making informed decisions. Most importantly, these are my opinions and mine alone. If you do not like them or disagree with them, I respect that and ask that you do the same.  \n  \n**Packaging:**  \nThis is my first MLS product since they switched from the old black PET jars to the new opaque jars with white screw top and waterproof labels. Wow, what a significant upgrade to the quality and presentation. The jars are very familiar in my hand as the dimensions are the same as the also impressive B&M jars. I like the wide mouth for loading soap. Packaging score 9.25/10.  \n  \n**Lather:**  \nWhile MLS’s tallow formula is a well known and well respected lathering soap in the current artisan market, the vegan has not received a lot of attention that I can see. This WILL change when people start trying this soap out. The lather stands with nearly any vegan soap I have ever tried. With a brush load time of less than ten seconds on a synthetic knot, I am able to create a voluminous lather that has insane slickness and above average cushion. The post shave is also amazing. It is almost to tell that this soap doesn’t have some kind animal fat in it, the post shave is that good. Lather score 9.85/10.  \n  \n**Scent:**  \nWhen I was looking to purchase my first MLS product in some time, I was having a hard time deciding with all of the options out there. Through a conversation with Eric McDaniels, based on my current top soaps, he suggested Bodhisattva. He summarized the scent as similar to B&M Classique aftershave, which is amongst my favorite aftershave scents. He was spot on with his description and his suggestion. This scent is an intoxicating Fougere that to my nose smells like B&M Fougere Aromatique made sweet love to B&M Classique aftershave and MLS Bodhisattva was born. The website describes the scent as follows: “A calming blend of Oriental woods, incense, and floral.” It is very beautiful and those who enjoy earthy Fougeres will enjoy this. Scent score 9.80/10.  \n  \n**Price:**  \nAt $18.00 for 3.3 oz of soap, this is on the expensive side of artisan soaps. It comes in at $5.45/oz which is some of the priciest soa I own. I will not kill the score completely because the ingredients list is of extremely high quality: Stearic Acid, Sustainable Organic Palm Oil (RSPO), Coconut Milk, Aloe Vera Juice, Coconut Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Hydroxide, Kokum Butter, Castor Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Shea Butter, Rice Bran Oil, Essential Oils Price score 7/10.  \n  \n**Bottom Line:**  \nI am really happy that I grabbed this soap when it came back in stock. I was trhilled with the customer service from Eric and Samantha, especially the private conversation with Eric that turned me towards this soap. Bodhisattva is a very special soap in the MLS product line and it should be tried by everyone, just to see how good a vegan soap can perform. Fougere lovers will find this is an absolute have-to-have in their den. Because of the marks above, MLS Bodhisattva rates out at a 9.46/10.  \n  \nHere is a video review: https://youtu.be/V09oCmCD_7o\n",

Up to the 1 and 1/4 line then add honey till it reaches 2 cups then add 2 tablespoons of adobo paste, ( I always add a little bit more) 1/4th cup of water to help with the immersion. 1/4th cup of salt blend on high, slowly pour 3 cups of rice bran oil to emulsify. Once done turn off blender add 1 tablespoon of ground black pepper and 2 teaspoons of oregano. Do not blend, use a spoon or ladle to mix. Good to go enjoy😉",

        "body": "Kingtater: Would you have to get it when the dukes are mature? 20 min of cps is extremely weak, less than bakeberries. All around just seems like a plant you don't want to get but you have to because garden sac. \n\nTrueffet Truffle: 12 HOURS OF CPS. 50% bank cap. That would make garden combos really good but the time to grow them takes a really long time. If you could get a garden of them, you could actually get some good cookies. I have some mixed feelings on how balanced this is.  \n\n\nWhite Trueffet Truffle: The only reason why I would see you doing this in a garden combo is if you're doing it with more normal truffles. The big problem is that it takes 2x as long to grow as jqb. This really just seems like a jqb but worse in every way to get. This would be a giant problem for garden sacrificing and I think it shouldn't exist because of that.   \n\n\nSweet berries: This plant might replace garden sacrificing. Only problem with it is that it takes a 2x jqbs lifetime to mature (because of .5 per tick). The lifetime is so long that you would jump so many ticks at once but with a super low chance. The only people that would use is the people that don't need their garden for combos or anything.   \n\n\nRice bran oil: balanced enough, though I would change it to make grandmas make more cps, not all buildings.  \n\n\nPopcorn: Instead of +1% cps, make it give more clicking power (like +1%/+2%).  \n\n\nTruffle butter: Not easy to get, and seems pretty weak too (for how hard it is to get). Maybe make it easier to get?  \n\n\nSand: I doubt you would use this much. It just seems like all the other dirts combined. This would make it pretty bad because you're usually just going for 3 things: mutating plants, growing plants, and using plants. The only good reason I would see anyone using this is for the extra seed drop chance so you can get drops easier.   \n\n\nSynthetic Fertilizer: The biggest problem I see with this is that it is impossible for weeds to grow directly or adjacent to plants (in a 3x3 next to the plant). This dirt would most likely change this rule for balancing purposes though. If you're mutating plants, you'll be able to use it without a weedkiller because weed spawns are already pretty low so doubling them wouldn't make a huge effect. You could live without one though it is very convienent to have one. Seems like a very op soil that would be used a lot for mutating. Growing plants with it isn't very good since you're probably just filling your garden with plants (like gclovers). This just seems like a better woodchips in almost every way.   \n\n\nTLDR: All of the plants that were stated are very long to grow, making it 1. very hard to garden sacrifice and 2. making them not very realistic. The cronerice/thumbcorn drops don't make sense with the plant itself. Truffle butter is extremely hard to get. Sand is almost useless and synthetic fertilizer is just a better woodchips.   \n\n\nConclusion: If everything got added right now, it would make lump gathering way easier but garden sacrificing would be way harder. I personally think that it wouldn't make a huge difference because click combos might be better. If click combos were worse than a truffle combo, then it would really change things. I just don't like how all of the plants take days to grow. If you are patient, it would be far easier to get cookies. At the very least, this would balance garden combos and click combos a tiny bit.",

For some reason, this new batch of perfumes I got  this month were all either unpleasant or medicinal, and I was just hoping that other people would have the same reaction. To clarify: the scents I got were a few bugs and cake, secrets of wives and widows, and you are our may queen- 5/6 have an herbal/planty note.

I much prefer the new oil, it muddies the scents less for me. But I think it must be down to personal taste! Any Suc scents smell RANCID in the bottle to me, regardless of notes, and any NAVA scents go rancid on me no matter what, so I chalk those up to carrier oil or some base ingredient.   \n\n\nIn regards to aging, I feel like D&F scents in the new carrier oil are mooostly okay immediately for me, but shift to just be generally stronger with rest. The exception is honey for me; D&F honey notes are weird on me (and in the bottle to me) without rest. I own a 4 Bugs and Cake scents, and I don't get anything remotely medicinal or unpleasant on any of the 4, except Bee and Red Velvet, which has a honey note and needed rest.  \n\n\nI hope the scents improve for you with rest!!
