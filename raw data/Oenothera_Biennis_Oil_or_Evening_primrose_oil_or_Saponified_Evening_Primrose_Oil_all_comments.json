    "body": "This post was inspired by one asking [People with oily skin, do you follow a different routine around your periods?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/qe0ah4/people_with_oily_skin_do_you_follow_a_different/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Which was once a whole hobby of mine 😂  because I had acne, sensitive skin *and* PMDD (Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, which is basically PMS, only depression-level). \n\nMy skin *always* flared up in the two weeks before, and as u/kaliroger said, it felt like all my progress would go down the drain every month 😅 It felt like a never-ending battle. And even derms would be like: that's that hormonal acne 🤷🏽‍♀️ That, and my terrifying PMDD got me real desperate to figure out what I could do to make life better. And I did! 😆\n\nI figured how to work WITH my cycle instead of being an unwilling participant and simply hating it... which, I really did *hate* it 😅 People usually call this \"cycle syncing\" or [\"cycle mapping\"](https://www.focusboosterapp.com/blog/menstrual-cycle-mapping-how-women-can-improve-their-productivity-and-health-period/), and it can be done to great effect with exercise, skin, nutrition, mood - the whole holistic package! Now I'm at peace with my cycle, and appreciate it for what it is, how it serves as a reminder of my connection with nature... and keeps me humble 😐 Sounds hippy dippy, but what can I say... I *am* hippy dippy 😂\n\n\n✨ I do STRONGLY recommend any of y'all with a period to TRACK YOUR CYCLE. Tracking my cycle allowed me to catch a serious health problem very early. Thankfully, I was able to seek treatment ASAP, and have a clean bill of health today 😌🙏🏽 If there's one thing you take away from this post, let it be \n#TRACK YOUR PERIOD \n\n\nI use [the Clue app](https://helloclue.com/), and have for four or five years. Now I have Data with a capital \"D\" about my cycle 😂\n\nSo this is how you can use skincare to support your skin health throughout, and prevent hormonal acne as much as possible, by having good foresight! \n\nThere are four phases to the menstrual cycle, and each causes hormonal changes in the integumentary system - skin, hair and nails. \n\n#🌑 WEEK 1: Menstruation - Soothe and hydrate\n\n*Low estrogen, low progesterone, prostaglandins at the end of bleeding*\n\n\n* Day 1 is counted as the first day you experience bleeding, so you might be having cramps, stomach trouble and all sorts of discomfort, but relief from the hormonal buildup has also started to happen! You'll feel your energy levels and body begin to gain strength again. You may have stopped getting new pimples and breakouts, but your skin is at it's most sensitive... you may also still be breaking out 😅 Period stuff is YMMV at its finest 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\n\n* Focus on soothing and repairing your skin. Think damage control, and supporting your skin's wound HEALING ability. Use soothing ingredients and products that you KNOW are tried and tested for you, that your skin likes. No new products! \n\n* Right after your period ends, you might experience dehydration, due to a sudden rise in prostaglandins.  So you wanna provide extra hydration and you can use slightly more emollient/occlusive barrier repair products without fear of breaking out. Well done for getting through the winter phase, skin! 🥰 Nourishment and support for you! ❤\n\n#🌒 WEEK 2: Follicular Phase - Stimulate and experiment\n\n*High estrogen, low progesterone*\n\n* It's ✨charmed✨ week! When you feel great, you look your best, your skin is glowy and resilient, spring has sprung, vasant rithu (spring season) is ON! 😆😆😆 You'll have that inner Glow, and your skin's healing ability is at an all-cycle high! \n\n* It's time to try new products! Using something new at this point in your cycle gives it the best possible shot. It's also the best time to start an active like vitamin C, that can be irritating. Yes, you may still experience irritation in the coming weeks, but it gives you the best possible start 😤 If something breaks you out this week, it *breaks you out*. It simply does *not* suit you. \n\n* Pain tolerance is also at an all-time high, so this is the best time to get waxed, threaded, etc. Not only will it hurt less, but you'll experience less irritation, and you'll heal from what irritation you do get much faster! \n\n* Ditto for any procedures like extractions, microneedling, laser, peels - hell, even actual surgical procedures! If you have the option to choose when to schedule them, pick this week in your cycle. \n\n#🌗 DAY 14/MID-CYCLE: Ovulation - Clear pores and prevent acne\n\n*Highest estrogen, low progesterone, bump in testosterone*\n\n* A spike in testosterone may cause a random pimple or two at this point, but it will heal fast, and you'll be at max glow still ☺\n\n* Acne that emerges during the second half of the cycle, during PMS, is a flaring up and inflammation of clogged pores that were *already* there. So NOW is the time, while your skin is still resilient, to focus on exfoliation and clear out all the clogged pores that would be NBD - if they didn't end up turning into acne at the end of the cycle 😅 \n\n* The Ordinary/ Minimalist Peeling Solution! This is your time to shiiiine! 😂\n\n* Now is the time for a facial, Fiddysnails's [pore cleansing method](https://glowieco.com/blogs/news/fiddysnails-jude-chao-updated-pore-clearing-method-to-remove-sebaceous-filaments) (which became a trend called [\"gritting\"](https://www.healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/gritting)), or simply a [meticulous, thorough oil cleanse](https://youtu.be/3z0YPACfhBk) to clear out clogged pores. \n\n* If you have active acne or redness, DO NOT do prolonged massage. You may spread bacteria and increase heat and inflammation. You can follow Fiddysnails's method, massaging LIGHTLY, no more than a minute, to oil cleanse - no longer than you would on a daily basis. The method will still be effective ☺\n\n* Some women may find they can do these steps in week 3, as well. Everyone's body is different. Observe your own skin, and adjust as per your own unique pattern of changes 🤗❤\n\n#🌔 WEEK 3: Luteal Phase: Oil control \n\n*Lower estrogen, rising progesterone*\n\n* This is when you may start to experience oily skin. Some women may not experience this till the end of the week, or even the start of week 4, some may start getting oily as soon as they're done with ovulation. \n\n* This week is all about oil control and gentle chemical exfoliation. 'Tis the time for CLAY MASKS and BHAs. Some people's skin can handle oil cleansing massages during this phase, mine cannot 🤷🏽‍♀️ I have sensitive skin, so I keep massages for closer to ovulation time. \n\n* You could consider upping your cleansing game one notch. If you usually rinse with only water in the morning, a gentle cleanser might help. If you use gentle cleansers already, you skin might benefit from a foaming one during this half of your cycle. Might be some options to consider - remember to observe your skin condition. Your skin's response will tell you if you're causing too much dehydration! \n\n* You want to really be getting the most use out of your BHAs and niacinamide at this stage. If you use a BHA twice a week, you could add an extra day. Ditto niacinamide. If you're already using a BHA, an AHA or azelaic acid daily or regularly, don't overdo it, stick to adding a clay mask (or two) in there. If you have dry skin, maybe a lactic acid mask. You're already doing enough 😌\n\n* Over production of oil can be somewhat balanced by providing more hydration, to balance oil-water levels. More hydration, less emollients/occlusives! \n\n* Dialling back on the thick moisturisers is a good idea. Perhaps a plain aloe gel over your serum is enough. Maybe you just use *less* moisturiser. Skip the facial oils till after your period. Cut down the number of steps in your routine. There's a lot you can do to handle sebum production and prevent breakouts, simply by holding back on over-moisturising at this point. Less is definitely more! \n\n#🌔 WEEK 4: Cool and soothe pre-menstrual inflammation\n\n*Low estrogen, high progesterone*\n\n* Your skin will now be peak sensitivity and oiliness, and you're probably breaking out 🙃 Autumn is upon us, and the body is withdrawing to deal with Very Important Inner Matters 🧐\n\n* As in the menstrual phase, you wanna avoid new products. Use soothing products you know your skin likes. For me that's mixing a quarter teaspoon zinc oxide powder into my night moisturiser, with three or four drops MCT oil to offset the slight drying effect. My skin is visibly calmed the next morning 😌 Work smarter, not harder! 😂❤\n\n* Keeping your face cool helps calm and soothe breakouts, preventing them from getting worse. Doing soothing, cooling face packs - aloe, potato, cucumber, oats, gel packs... All of that really helps to prevent the sensitivity from resulting in actual pimples, and speeds healing. I have a [DIY gel masks post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/pq4apu/how_to_make_diy_gel_masks_with_xanthan_gum/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), if that interests you. \n\n* Even just soaking oats in water for a couple hours, and then blending them smooth, keeping that in the fridge. Amazing for soothing and cooling. Add some honey for extra hydration. Yum yum 😂\n\n* Keeping aloe gel in the fridge and doing a thick layer as a mask, then washing it off is the easiest option 🤔 You could also get those DIY blank sheet masks and soak them in green or black tea and use those. If you have a sheet mask brand that suits you, using that after keeping it in the fridge... \n\n* Korean people talk about skin temperature all the time, and it's now become a mainstream thing - like how heat can trigger melanin production and worsen melasma and hyperpigmentation. Also, apparently a one degree Celsius increase in temperature can [increase sebum production by *ten percent*](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.glamour.com/story/how-to-combat-oily-shiny-skin-in-the-summertime/amp) 🤯 Cooling your skin is really effective and underrated! HIGHLY recommend for those with inflammatory acne, redness, and sensitive skin, regardless of menstrual cycle. \n\n* Cooling does NOT mean using ice directly on your face, that shit can give you burst capillaries. Extreme temperatures are never a good idea for skin!\n\n* Continue to keep your skincare light if your skin is particularly oily. And sit tight ❤ As with the seasons, this too is a phase that will pass 😌❤\n\n#In summation:\n\nMany of us who have already come a long way to figure out our own skin probably do most of these things without consciously thinking about it. After a point, you do get to a place where you intuitively react to your skin's condition, how it looks, feels, and responds to touch. For some of us, this way of structuring might just be making a connection with our menstrual cycle we weren't previously consciously aware of doing. I hope you found something of interest or value to you here ☺ \n\nFor those who are struggling with acne and hormonal breakouts, perhaps this angle of approach may be a game changer! I know that not everyone has a regular menstrual cycle AT ALL, and PCOD/PCOS can make things seem totally unpredictable and out of control. Counter-intuitively, it might be observing your skin condition that gives you clues about your menstrual cycle, instead of the other way around! Even with a regular cycle, these guidelines are not hard and fast. Each phase rolls over into the next without clear demarcation, the labels are merely for ease of understanding 😅 Hopefully you find some info here that helps you make the best of your personal situation and get to know your own personal patterns well ❤\n\nViewing our bodies and our natural cycles as something to be conquered or ignored usually leads to resentment and anger towards ourselves, in my experience 😅 It did for me, anyway. I was antagonistic towards my body. Competitive, rather than collaborative. There's a whole patriarchy angle to that, but I'm not gonna get into it 😂 Embracing our feminine energy, and our connection with nature through our own bodies can be a profound, self-actualising journey on every level, and skin can be an amazing entry point to that. [Soft power!](https://carnegieendowment.org/2020/12/15/case-for-south-korean-soft-power-pub-83406#:~:text=Clearly%2C%20South%20Korea's%202020%20wins,co%2Dopting%20rather%20than%20coercing.) 😤 South Korea knows what's up! \n\n\n\nHere are a few SKINCARE ARTICLES on the menstrual cycle, that I used as reference: \n\n✨ [Clean Beauty School article](https://cleanbeautyschool.com/cycle-syncing-skincare/) \n\n✨ [This Is When Your Skin Will Be Amazing, According To Your Period](https://medium.com/@GlowHQ/this-is-when-your-skin-will-be-amazing-according-to-your-period-6e368b7c6e8f) \n\n✨ [A good, simple infographic](https://preview.redd.it/g1xfteca0bw31.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c3d5477c9798c05cf81acb5375712f13007628c2) that sums it up. I got it from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/dqmx7c/misc_anyone_with_a_menstrual_cycle_this_may/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), on r/SkincareAddiction 😆🙏🏽\n\n✨ [Another infographic with specific hormone level percentages](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJgfn8DM4aw/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) \n\n\n\nHere are a few ARTICLES ON CYCLE-SYNCING:\n\n✨ [The Menstrual Cycle: Nutrition, Training & Fat Loss](https://blog.ultimateperformance.com/the-menstrual-cycle-nutrition-training-fat-loss/) \n\n✨ [How To Be More Productive (Not Less!) By Harnessing The Power Of Your Menstrual Cycle](https://www.inspiringleadershipnow.com/women-in-leadership-menstrual-cycle-productivity/) \n\n✨ [Menstrual cycle mapping: How women can improve their productivity and health, period.](https://www.focusboosterapp.com/blog/menstrual-cycle-mapping-how-women-can-improve-their-productivity-and-health-period/) \n\n✨ [How to Work with Your Period, Not Against It](https://www.healthline.com/health/make-your-period-work-for-you) \n\n\n\nIf you suffer from extreme cyclic acne, PMS or PMDD, severe breast pain during PMS, etc, I would recommend you consult and take the guidance of a trained professional - there is no substitute for qualified gynaecologists, dermatologists and nutritionists. You can consult with your doctors if it is safe FOR YOU to try [seed cycling](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/seed-cycling), or take [evening primrose oil supplements](https://www.reliasmedia.com/articles/21335-evening-primrose-oil-for-symptoms-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-menopause) during the second half of your cycle. You can also check out r/PMDD.\n\nIf you're interested in being more aware and accepting of the emotional cycle that accompanies menstruation, the [Hormone Horoscope app](https://www.myhormonology.com/about/what-is-the-hormone-horoscope/) was super helpful for me, to be able to predict and adjust my behaviour and responses. It helped me get over my fear of PMDD and releasing control, by making things very matter-of-fact. Highly recommend! 😆❤\n\nI, personally, used to be a lot more careful to track my period and sync my skincare, do seed cycling etc, when I was experiencing active acne and fungal acne, PMDD, severe mastalgia (breast pain) etc. My mental health has come a LONG way since then, resulting in a huge reduction in symptoms ☺🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 I've also gotten to understand my own skin and how to care for it.\n\nThese days, I'm not super careful about the skincare aspect. My acne is well under control. My routine provides good prevention and maintenance regardless of where I am in my cycle. I'll get a few small breakouts and do a few soothing face packs during week 4, mix in zinc oxide with my night moisturiser and that's it. I no longer do seed cycling, as I find taking evening primrose oil during the second half of my cycle reduces my PMDD symptoms to a manageable level. I'm super grateful to be able to relax now that my hard work and research has paid off 😂🙏🏽\n\nIt's my hope that this will help some of y'all, too 🤗❤ Thanks for reading! Byeee!",

        "body": "Hi there! \n\nIt seems like you may be looking for some information on Dermarolling/Dermastamping. \n\nDermarolling can improve the appearance of atrophic scarring when done correctly. \n\nHowever, there are several risks and I'd like to warn you about them: \n\n* You should not be doing this every day. When done in-office, treatments are spaced a few weeks to a month apart.\n\n* Done improperly you can end up with hypopigmentation (white or colorless spots in the skin that do not return to a normal color)\n\n* It hurts.\n\n* You can not fully sterilize the needles at home.

    "body": "This happened a while back, but another post made me think of this. \n\n\nJNGMIL (who I have never met, and will never meet according to DH) was a botch midwife back in the day, and let MIL attend a lot of births so MIL felt like she knew all the ropes. She pried and asked me really personal questions throughout my pregnancy, and pretty much guilted her way to my ultrasound appointments where she would just talk to the ultrasound tech about herself the whole time. \n\nShe continually made comments about how I wasn’t gaining enough weight (her, and her daughters who have had children all gained a ton of weight during their pregnancies and never got it off. I was different) and commented about my eating habits multiple times even when I asked her to stop. \n\nIt all got worse in the third trimester. Every time she saw me, she would ask if I was having contractions yet, if I had felt the baby drop, if my doctor wanted to induce me, etc. My baby was due on January 10th and she tried to talk me on Thanksgiving about inducing her early so I could have a Christmas baby. She told me about all of the midwife tricks to get baby to come early (like castor oil, evening primrose oil, etc) ...I think tf not. \n\nAnyway so Christmas rolls around, and while we are all at the table (husband has a huge family, there were 20+ people there) eating dinner, MIL stands up and slams her hands down on the table, making everyone else shut up, and looks directly at me and asks me “How dilated is your cervix?!” \n\nRight then and there, in the middle of Christmas dinner with the whole IL family staring at her and me. \n\nI told her I hadn’t had my doctor check because I didn’t really think it mattered, baby will come when baby wants to come. And she flipped out and said I could go into labor at any second and we needed to rush me to the hospital. I wasn’t laboring AT ALL. She really wanted that Christmas baby... \n\nHusband and I ended up leaving early, and I didn’t see MIL again until after baby was born -a week AFTER the due date.",

If you missed it, the first of the series can be found here: [ROSACEA, REDNESS, and IRRITATION](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4v2uii/best_products_for_common_skin_concerns_series/)\n\nProducts, tips, or advice that come up frequently will be listed in **bold.** I have grouped everything that's toner -> ampoule since the lines can get kind of blurry in those categories, and oil-based and foaming cleansers are also grouped.\nI have included Western products in order to be inclusive of the advice found on this subreddit. I have tried to place those items lower on the list in each category to give prominence to Asian items, given the nature of this sub.\n\nPlease feel free to add to the comments - if you see your HG for acne isn't listed, tell me! I would love for this to be a working document that is edited as needed, so we can also consider converting into a similar format as it exists over on r/SkinCareAddiction\n\n\n**PLEASE NOTE:** *What follows is a compilation of the advice given on this subreddit to address conditions associated with cystic and comedonal acne and breakouts. It is not a substitute for medical advice or the advice of a dermatologist, nor are they indicative of my own preferences or what I would personally advise. Before trying any new product, it behooves you to check ingredient lists, take note of personal or individual sensitivities, patch test, and introduce only one new product at a time.*\n\n*IF YOU HAVE A FEVER, SEVERE HEADACHE OR NECK STIFFNESS, EYE IRRITATION, LIP OR OTHER FACIAL SWELLING, PLEASE LEAVE THE INTERNET AND SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION FROM A HUMAN BEING. IN PERSON.*\n\n**For those of you experiencing hormonal outbreaks**, its important to communicate this with your healthcare provider. Hormonal acne may be a sign of other endocrine/hormonal issues that should be evaluated by a medical professional. Please do not rely on Dr. Internet for addressing issues of hormonal imbalance.\n\n**Another Note:** This list proved quite difficult to compile, given that many contributors with oily/acne-prone skin are using multiple actives and/or retinoids to treat their skin. As such, many use products to restore a depleted moisture barrier that may prove far too heavy for someone with oily skin who is NOT using these treatments. I strongly urge use of this list merely as a starting point, and advise looking at the original threads for additional details.

It can be easy to want a quick fix, but most products that address acne or problem skin take TIME and consistency.\n\n* Remember even if you are generally acne free, you can still get a breakout now and then and it doesn't mean the products have failed. It's better to look at acne in an overall general improvement kind of way, rather than all or nothing, otherwise you are going to feel like you're failing constantly (u/TrishBrennan) \n\n* Make sure to rule out dehydration/compromised moisture barrier as the cause of your acne. Acne can be caused by many things (diet, allergy, hormones, even fungus!) but the easiest version to cure is the one caused by dehydrated, overworked skin. (u/Daheep)\n\n* Be careful to avoid overexfoliation, which can make your acne worse. Many acne patients, especially those familiar with the classic Western medical approach to acne can be over-exuberant with their exfoliators, leading to a compromised moisture barrier, which can lead to more reactive skin. The AB (and in many ways, SCA) approach is far more gentle, aiming to treat acne-prone skin with hydration and only using as much exfoliation as necessary. \n\n* **Stop all other actives when starting prescription acne treatments,** namely chemical exfoliants or any other potentially irritating parts of your routine.\n\n* Make sure you have a solid base routine with a good moisturizer before starting prescription treatment, as many prescriptions can rapidly and drastically deplete your moisture barrier. **A healthy moisture barrier is critical to clear skin.**\n\n* Sometimes it's not about ADDING something, but about ELIMINATING an offending ingredient. Try to identify what products and ingredients help your skin and which seem to make it worse. Sometimes acne can actually be irritation in disguise.\n\n* If starting a retinoid/rx medication/AHA, **USE SUNSCREEN**\n\n* Many ABers will swear by techniques and approaches that may seem counter-intuitive to the unintitiated, such as using oil cleansers as a first step, applying facial oils, and moisturizing the skin. People with oily skin general fear oils in most of their forms, so it can be difficult to feel comfortable applying oils to the face or moisturizing creams. That feeling is normal, feel free to try different suggestions and techniques depending on comfort level, but try to keep an open mind. \n\n* Check your make up application tools (brushes, Beauty Blender) - these may be a source of bacteria and mold that could be at the route of your skin problems. Make sure you wash these tools thoroughly and regularly and let dry completely between uses.\n\n* Sanitize your cell phone\n\n* Change your pillow case twice a week or use a t-shirt over your pillow\n\n* Use new face towel every day\n\n* Avoid picking or touching your face (hydrocolloid patches can help with this)\n\n* Practice positive affirmations\n\n* If you want to truly mimic how they do things in Korea, go see a dermatologist, especially one that specializes in aesthetic dermatology. Koreans are much more likely to see a dermatologist for even minor breakouts. Of course, accessibility and affordability are an issue for many, so of course, this may be easier said than done. \n\n* Get some sleep already!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**EDITORIAL COMMENT** This is the topic that is probably covered the most thoroughly here on Reddit, giving that the demographic likely skews younger. After reading through thousands of comments and posts on this topic, the major takeaway for the AB approach to acne is to use an Asian-style routine (double cleansing, multiple hydrating layers, gentle approach, use of whitening/brightening products that also have anti-inflammatory effects) in conjunction with prescription medications. Retinoid based treatments can be very harsh on the skin's moisture barrier, and lucky for those of us who are AB enthusiasts, we have multiple tools at our disposal to replenish lost hydration and provide the necessary occlusion to keep that moisture in the skin. While you can of course try maxing out your OTC exfoliation, the fastest route to clear skin is very likely going to be to see a dermatologist, and then using your AB routine to deal with the aftermath. **Many, many respondents have said that the single most effective change that cleared their acne was seeing a dermatologist**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Sources*\n\n[Acne prone ABers: What product has made the biggest difference in your acne](https://m.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/40rry9/acne_prone_abers_what_product_has_made_the/?ref=search_posts)\n\n[HG Products for Acne Scares Combination Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4f5u65/holy_grail_products_for_acne_scares_combination/)\n\n[What do Koreans use for acne?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4eew3q/what_do_koreans_use_for_acne/)\n\n[AB for Acne Prone Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3aehm0/asian_beauty_for_acneprone_dry_skin/)\n\n[For oily and acne-prone: do you use moisturizing toners?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4immov/for_oily_and_acne_prone_do_you_use_moisturizing/)\n\n[What's best for acne prone skin?

The hormonal imbalance causing acne may be a symptom of an underlying diagnosis that needs proper medical attention, or it could be that acne is the only symptom of that slight hormone imbalance but that disrupting those hormones via spearmint might lead to other problems e.g. menstrual cycle changes. People should speak to their doctor before self-medicating their hormones since they're responsible for a lot more than acne. Or you could [add this blog link](http://www.fanserviced-b.com/skincare-routine-for-hormonal-cystic-acne/) that has disclaimers in it to the list? You rock for putting this all together!",

        "body": "Thank you so much for curating this list of products and information! The amount of time it must have taken is incredible. I just wanted to add that, a few months ago, I created a post about [things and habits that keep my skin clear](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4cn3s9/simple_things_and_habits_ive_noticed_that_help/?ref=share&ref_source=link). I am more on the combo/acne side rather than oily/acne side... but the points I made and the comments added to that post are still very relevant and helpful for myself (as I imagine many other ABers who deal with acne). Here's the post:  \n>I was just looking over the sub, and although this post might not be totally AB-centric, it involves AB. A little background about me first:    \n  \n>&nbsp;  \n\n>I got into AB at the beginning of July last year (2015). You might remember [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3bospx/tomorrow_is_july_1st_i_am_making_a/?ref=share&ref_source=link) if you were involved in the community at the time. The point is, my skin likes to be babied. It doesn't like being poked, picked, scratched, rubbed, chafed, or abused. I've had acne since I was 12 years old. Yes, 12. I was still in 7th grade at that time. My acne was mild then, but it has noticeably progressed over the years, and became hormonal during high school (around my junior year, IIRC.) I always thought that using products that would dry my skin out would clear up my acne for good. I abided by Western skincare practices, and used an exfoliating face wash, astringent toner, and light moisturizer, followed by a benzoyl peroxide spot cream. If I didn't have a spot treatment, I would dab rubbing alcohol or tooth paste on my pimples. Did that type of routine work? Yeah, but only for the first week... and then my skin would become terribly dehydrated, flaky, sensitive, and red. I was on my high school swim team, and I would have practice every weekday for about 2 hours. As soon as I got out of the pool, I would reapply my makeup and go home instead of washing my face since I was so embarrassed of my acne. I would frequently sleep in my makeup and wouldn't wash my sheets more than once every two months. I would pick my skin almost daily, and then not wash my face after picking for sometimes hours. Basically, my skincare habits were terrible and unsanitary. I didn't consistently follow my routine, and I slept in my makeup.   \n  \n>So fast-forward a few years... I'm now in my early twenties and I have a well-established skincare routine that centers around AB and AB practices. The most clearly-defined Asian skincare practice being to keep my skin hydrated, even if it's oily. I follow my routine religiously, and when I don't, I sheet-mask or use an extra amount of my Mizon Snail Recovery Gel Cream ;) Since sticking with my routine, my acne has significantly cleared up and my skin has become brighter, glow-ier, and smoother.   \n   \n> &nbsp;  \n\n>**I just wanted to share with the community that I've noticed simple things over the past year or two that have immensely helped keep my skin clear. Here they are (finally):**   \n \n>* Do not pick, squeeze, scratch, or dig at your pimples or skin if you can help it    \n* Keep track of your progress with picking at your skin with an app; stay accountable for picking    \n* If you've got a pimple or whitehead that's about to pop or come out, wash your hands/sanitize them first and then LIGHTLY pop the pimple; immediately put a hydrocolloid bandage on it  \n* Keep your sheets (and especially your pillowcase) clean; wash them at least once or twice a month  \n* Do you morning skincare routine daily and don't skimp on the sunscreen    \n* Don't reapply powder makeup more than once in a day; instead, blot with a tissue or paper towel or toilet paper and then lightly swipe or dab over it with a makeup brush or sponge that has nothing on it to fix the finish  \n* If you wear makeup, wash it off nightly and continue with your nightly routine    \n* If you *really* can't do your entire routine, at the very least: cleanse with a cleansing water/wipe and put your active or prescription on followed by at least one moisturizer or emulsion  \n* Try to be cognizant of your hand placement during the day, and keep your hands away from your face as much as possible, especially if you haven't washed them or used hand sanitizer   \n* Research the ingredients in all the products you would like to buy BEFORE you buy them and take note of the ingredients your skin is sensitive to  \n* Write down your current routine somewhere and record your skin's progress using pictures, qualitative analysis, or quantitative analysis (by this, I mean count the number of pimples on your face at a point in time and record it) and try to determine whether or not your skin gets better or worse when a new product is introduced or an old product is thrown out  \n* Introduce only one new product at once, and use it for at least 2 weeks before introducing another new product (because who am I kidding? Patch-testing takes way too much patience when it comes to acne breakouts... if I breakout after a new non-active product has been introduced, I'll know the product doesn't work for me and I'll stop using it)  \n* Be patient with active products and prescription products; they can take weeks or months for your skin to adjust to, depending on their strengths; don't give up if they cause an initial purge or breakout  \n* Tailor your day-to-day moisturizing routine depending on how hydrated your skin feels   \n* Pay attention to your skin a day or two after using a sheet mask; if it looks like it's bright and clearer than usual, use another sheet mask that week; if it looks dull or the texture feels \"off,\" give your skin a breather and wait until the following week to use another sheet mask (YMMV for this one: I've noticed I get tiny whiteheads if I sheet mask too often in one week)  \n* Go to sleep around the same hour consistently and don't mess with your sleep schedule if you can help it; my skin breaks out when I don't have a regular sleeping schedule; try to get the same amount of rest every night (that could be 5 hours of sleep or 8 hours of sleep; just keep it CONSISTENT)  \n* Wipe down surfaces your face or hands touch regularly with a sanitizing wipe (phone, car steering wheel, hand sanitizer bottles, desks, laptops or cases, closet doors, handles, bathroom counters, etc.)    \n* Use prescription oral medications if your acne is hormonal (e.g. spironolactone, birth control, accutane, etc.)  \n* Can't emphasize this enough, but use sunscreen daily if you're going out (even to work or school)  \n  \n>---     \n\n>Suggestions from other users:    \n>\n* If you think your acne could be hormonal, make an appointment to see your doctor. Don't be stubborn like I was and needlessly suffer with acne. It has made a huge difference in my skin's texture, softness, and of course clarity. I wish I had started taking spironolactone years ago. (*from u/marmot33*)  \n* I would also like to add drinking lots of water, I noticed my skin gets very congested if I'm dehydrated (*from u/feverrayz*)    \n* washing sheets/pillowcases: You really should be doing this once a week, especially if you use hair products. So much dirt and oil builds up, not to mention sweat and facial products. My tip: flip your pillow over every night (clean side!) And change it once a week. And get some silk ones! You'll thank yourself when you're old like me. (*from u/misspiemisspoke*)  \n* If you're a chronic picker (like me) I'd recommend getting acrylic tips! They might not be for everyone, but I've found being physically unable to pick my skin is the only way I stop. Team no self-restraint over here haha. (*from u/AnthonyJCrawly*)  \n* instead of popping, get some lancets from a pharmacy. they're basically teeny scalpels and make a nice clean cut that heals better than the tear of a pop. lancet are about 8$for 100. (*from u/IWankYouWonk*)  \n* My tip: Wash your hands well before bed and if you put handcream on make sure that it's not something that will make you break out if you accidentally transfer some of it to your face while sleeping. (*from u/pennypoppet*)  \n* Something that I've found that works for me is also exercising. I go to the gym 5-6 times a week now and my skin has been noticeably clearer. It's usually clear, but I would get the occasional pimple. This has not happened since I starting gymming more frequently the last 3 months (*from u/AlphaBaby*)\n  \n>&nbsp;    \n\n>I probably have more somewhere stored deep in my brain but those are the suggestions that come to mind at the moment. Keep in mind, these are things that I've personally noticed over the last year that have improved my acne. I'm currently 85% clear and am in love with the texture and brightness of my complexion. I still have a little more progress to make with becoming totally clear, but compared to a year ago, my skin is doing fantastic and I couldn't be more grateful to this community and the wonderful source of knowledge its users have been :) All hail the snail!  \n   \n> &nbsp;    \n\n>*P.S. If you have any other simple tips you'd like me to add to the list, please leave them in the comments!*",

    "body": "Hello,\n\nSince at least October 2024, my wife \\[37F\\] has been exhibiting some strange symptoms most evenings.\n\n* Starts off a bit hyper, like the thing she's currently doing is the most important thing ever and she's fully into it\n   * Might sound benign, but includes things like making exaggerated hand gestures when she's looking for something, or getting super emotionally invested in something one of our kids has said\n* Asks the same question multiple times/talks about the same topic multiple times\n* Her posture changes, like she struggles to hold her head up normally - she's often leaning her chin towards her chest\n* (Sometimes that's all it is on a good night - maybe one in five is a good night)\n* Then it degrades further into tripping up over her own words, which she attempts to repeat when she knows she's got something wrong\n* She gets confused and doesn't seem to know what's going on\n* And the troubles with words can get even worse, like she's clearly trying to talk but it's not making any sense at all, or unable to say a single word properly - but she doesn't know she's doing it and can't understand why nobody understands her\n   * The thing that prompted me to make this post tonight was her inability to say \"geometry\". I started recording a video to show her in the morning, where she tries about 20 times to say the word, and by the end, is satisfied she's got it correct, but it's still totally wrong\n* She can also get incredibly clumsy and unbalanced, but that seems rarer. One time, she had a nasty fall getting out of the shower and put her foot through the wall\n\nShe's fine again by the following morning, but often doesn't remember much of the above. I've resorted to videoing some of the more extreme verbal examples to play back for her the next day. She had no recollection of the shower incident.\n\nWhen she's really bad, she often gets very tired and can go to bed around 7pm. Sometimes she will sleep right through until morning, but sometimes she will wake up later in the evening, at which point she's trending back to normal.\n\nAt first, I assumed she was secretly drinking, but I'm pretty confident I've ruled that out. I said this has been going on since at least October because I've been keeping a sort of diary of her symptoms which goes back that far (so it probably was going on before that too, as it would have taken me a while to decide to start logging it). I started off writing a few sentences each time it was really bad, but have now resorted to just logging the dates when something is off, and it's like 80-90% of the time.\n\nShe has been to see the doctor, who has done some routine blood tests twice now which showed nothing much out of the ordinary (first tests showed low folate, but that's now sorted). His theory is that it's more than likely psychological, but he wants to make a neuro referral just in case. Apparently the neuro folks agree that it's likely psychological, but it's just odd enough that they want to get involved. But her appointment with them isn't for another six weeks or so. In the mean time, I keep logging almost every day in my diary. NB: I've also shown the videos I've taken to that doctor, so he's aware of the issue (and very much agrees that the contents of the videos are not normal!)\n\nBackground: My wife is currently on a fairly low dose of escitalopram for her anxiety issues, and regularly takes co-codamol for a bad back. She also likely has undiagnosed ADHD. She has also recently started taking some vitamins/supplements after her first set of blood tests showed low folate levels: specifically a multi-vitamin tablet, vitamin D, evening primrose oil, folic acid. None of these have helped, nor have they made it any worse, as far as I can tell.\n\nOne more bit of info: If it IS psychological, it's not JUST caused by tiredness or stress. It always seems to start when we're at home and she has some unstructured time, after she finishes work around 3pm, where she catches up on misc jobs around the house (cooking dinner, making the kids their packed lunch, sorting laundry, etc). If she has no choice about what she's doing - e.g. we're out on a trip, we're taking a long car ride, etc - then this NEVER happens, even when the activity she's doing is more stressful and more tiring than normal everyday life. In these circumstances, she's \"with it\" right up until she falls asleep, no matter how tired she is. One more piece of evidence to support this is that she works in a school, and when the school is closed for the holidays, these symptoms have started even earlier in the day, due to more unstructured time available to her.\n\nSo, any idea what might be going on? Is a psychological cause more likely than anything else?\n\nI'm realllllllly worried and don't really know how to handle it. It's causing me an immense amount of stress.\n\nThanks very much in advance for any insight you can provide!\n\nPS: I'm keenly aware this sounds like she's drinking. But I really don't think that's the case - I've been keeping an eye on the amount of alcohol coming into the house, and an eye generally on our spending (we have a joint bank account). Nothing out of the ordinary is happening. I also bought a breathalyser, and she blew negative once when she was showing some pretty severe symptoms.\n\n  \nEdit: Going to bed now (In the UK), will respond to any comments/questions in the morning - thanks",

I think sometimes she drank on the way home and got rid if the bottles before she showed up.\n\nI say this because your story sounds so much like what her friends and family saw when she was drinking. I didn’t realize what was happening until it got really really bad. She hid it well for a long time. By the time she reached the stage you describe, she needed rehab.\n\nI can’t say with 100% certainty that this is what is happening, but I am extremely suspicious for substance abuse here, and I think that is what best fits these symptons.",

Marijuana, opiates, ketamine, and benzos can all cause the symptoms you describe here. If you aren't sure about alcohol or she's hiding it well, there are a few lab tests that can detect alcohol use several days after the last drink. So, there is a way to find out for sure, depending on how cooperative she is.\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this. I hope you get answers, and your wife gets the help she needs.",

    "body": "i've seen a lot of posts over the last few days requesting help with choosing oils for OCM, and since the responses are a bit repetitive, i decided to try to condense all the links and info in one big post!\n\nfor starters, check out [this list of comedogenicity ratings for oils](https://www.beneficialbotanicals.com/facts-figures/comedogenic-rating.html), and also the [oils and descriptions](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/oils.html) offered on GoW. GoW also offers sampler packs for specific skincare concerns. if you don't want to order online, whole foods and other ~healthy~ food stores carry brands like weleda and auracacia.\n\nhere is a quick overview of what i think are the most common/easiest to find oils! if you want to look into more exotic things (like meadowfoam seed or brazil nut or whatever), GoW is a great source of info. \n\n**mineral oil** - prob the best overall starter oil, because it is noncomedogenic (unlikely to clog pores or cause breakouts) and inert (will not react with anything in your skin). it's also very easy to find - you can use baby oil, or if you are sensitive to fragrance you can look for wood oil (snow river wood oil is ~$5 at bed bath & beyond). i don't recommend using mineral oil sold as a laxative because those are often thickened with tocopherols in a way that irritates or clogs a lot of people's skin.\n\n**other noncomedogenic oils** - sunflower, safflower, and hemp seed. these are good for acne-prone or easily clogged skin. keep in mind that if you have any contact allergies to plants, you want to be careful with oils from those plants just in case you have a reaction to the oils as well. \n\n**lighter oils** - grape seed, olive, sesame, jojoba, and apricot kernel. these are all slightly comedogenic, so patch test carefully. most of them tend to feel more moisturizing than noncomedogenic oils, with the exception of grape seed, which is somewhat astringent and can be a little drying.\n\n**richer oils** - almond and avocado. both of these have a slightly thicker/richer feel and tend to be very nourishing/moisturizing. again, these are slightly comedogenic, so patch test carefully. but these can be great for dry or dehydrated skin. unfortunately, due to their thicker texture, these oils are not as good at breaking up and quickly removing waterproof makeup as lighter oils.\n\n**highly comedogenic oils** - coconut oil, coconut butter, cocoa butter, mink oil, and soybean oil. these are not, like, guaranteed to break you out, but you need to be cautious if you have very acne-prone skin. \n\n\nthe following oils are used for specific skincare concerns:\n\n**castor oil** - has antibacterial properties, so it can help with acne. castor oil can be very drying, so you should dilute it to about 1-2 tbsp castor oil in 1 cup carrier oil. you can use that mixture either for ocm or to spot treat. do not use it undiluted to spot treat. i do not recommend using castor oil sold as a laxative for skincare purposes, for the same reasons mentioned in reference to mineral oil.\n\n**tea tree oil** - very good antibacterial, and can be super good for acne. tea tree oil is extremely drying/irritating, and you **should not ever use it undiluted!** undiluted tea tree oil can be extremely irritating, and even lead to chemical burns! you should dilute 1/4 tsp of tto in 1 cup of carrier oil, and you can use that mixture either for ocm or for a spot treatment. note that tea tree oil is usually sold as an essential oil, so it will usually be in a tiny bottle.\n\n**neem oil** - great for acne, and it is not drying, so you can use it undiluted as a spot treatment, or for ocm either alone or mixed with other carrier oils. word of caution - it smells super weird!\n\n**evening primrose oil** - this is supposedly really good for hormonal acne, but i have never personally tried it, and i can't find many sources to support this. however, there are [many,](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2133.1987.tb04085.x/abstract) [many](http://adc.bmj.com/content/75/6/494.abstract) sources supporting evening primrose oil as a very effective treatment for atopic dermatitis and eczema (although if you have either of those conditions, it would be best for you to be under the supervision of a derm or another medical professional, so talk to them before you start using anything new). as far as i know, it is fine to use this undiluted. \n\ngeneral notes on choosing oils:\n\n- be sure whatever you buy is 100% whatever oil and probably at least food grade. buzzwords like \"cold pressed,\" \"unrefined,\" etc, are *usually* good. for botanical oils, a lot of people think you should look for minimally processed or unrefined oils to ensure you get all the benefits from the oil. \n\n- when buying cooking oils (esp. relevant for olive, sunflower, and sesame oil), be very careful about what you buy and always patch test. there has been a lot of controversy lately about cooking oils being impure or diluted with other oils besides the one listed on the label, so be careful. [here](http://olivecenter.ucdavis.edu/news-events/news/files/olive%20oil%20final%20071410%20.pdf) is the 2010 report about olive oil that has people in a fuss about this.\n\n- your safest option, although it may not be the cheapest or the most convenient, is to buy oils that are sold specifically for skincare or cosmetic use.\n\ni hope this was somewhat helpful!! remember that no one can tell you for sure whether or not something will work for you or cause a negative reaction, so it's ultimately up to you to do some research and choose what to put on your face. and always patch test all the oils you want to use individually before mixing or putting anything all over your face!! :)",

He melts them all together, then chills them until they thicken, then whips them with a blender until they're fluffy and light.  \n\nI have been using this mixture as a skin moisturizer for a while now, but I used it for my OCM one night when I didn't have any other oil available. It was amazing!  My skin hasn't broken out as a result of using it, and it makes my skin look so much more radiant and plump than the other oils I've used.  \n\nI know other people might have issues with these oils, but I'm sticking with them.

Jojoba Oil in particularly seemed problematic for my forehead.\n\nI've been using Mineral Oil OCM with good results so far, but it's still hard to determine if it's been breaking me out (most likely suspect is CeraVe in the Tub, which I started using as a moisturizer around the same time).\n\nI was using undiluted TTO applied directly to my entire face (NOT spot-treating), and that did cause a chemical burn. Oops. Now I use undiluted Tea Tree Oil to spot-treat (which you said never to do!) and it's worked well so far, since I'm not applying it for prolonged periods of time to any region (hence, spot-treating).\n\nI was thinking making the switch to Neem Oil from TTO as a spot-treatment. Does it really stink that bad? Is it as effective as TTO, or does that depend?\n\nAlso, what washcloth do you recommend in general? I have a microfiber towel that I use, but I feel as though it may be slightly too rough.\n\nAlso thinking about adding just a few drops of TTO to the Mineral Oil per your suggestion because... well, why not?

I’m exactly 39 weeks, I can’t get induced until AFTER my due date because apparently they’re so backed up, they aren’t even taking elective inductions…\n\nSo, I’ve made a conscious decision that this baby is coming today. It’s a good day to have a baby. Sun is shining, it’s a holiday weekend, easy to remember 25.5.25…\n\nMy first was born at 39 weeks, 6 days—the mucous plug came out about 4 days ago, and the baby dropped like a month ago. Can’t be THAT far off.\n\nHere’s some things I’m doing today to get things going:\n-spicy food\n\n-evening primrose oil\n\n-red raspberry leaf tea\n\n-curb walking\n\n-sex\n\n-hot shower (can’t take bath since the mucous plug is out)\n\n-squats \n\n-yoga ball bouncing \n\n\nAny other tips??? I can’t do dates with this one. With my son I could eat dates all day, this one makes me vomit dates for some reason. So weird. \n\nI’ll report back if I’m able to get anything going today, because I’m DONE. \n\n\n**********UPDATE***********\nOf course, the universe had other plans. Our friend fell down her stairs and broke her ribs so my husband had to take her to the hospital because we’re the only people she has in our city, so I’ve been home alone with our toddler ALL DAY, (still not home) with zero chance to try these induction tricks…as was my plan for the day. \n\nSo, guess I’ll try these tomorrow?\n\n\n************UPDATE 2***********\nDidn’t get to do much on the list because of my friend breaking her ribs and husband gone all day to help her. Baby was not born yesterday…however, at 6am today I am having contractions and believe I am in early labour 😬 \nSo, not 25.5.25, but maybe 26.5.25 instead \n\n\n**********UPDATE 3************\nTwo days after posting this, I went into labour! And boy did it happen quickly. I didn’t get any warning and almost birthed in the car. Do NOT recommend lol. That might have to be a whole other post in itself on what I did that I believe kick started the process, though be warned…baby came out FAST",

    "body": "Reading about some wholesome stories reminded me of this one, it's sort of wholesome....I think?\n\nI work for a company that gives me pretty good security and decent benefits, I had this throughout the entirety of the health crisis. I'm also lactose intolerant.\n\nYes they're connected to the story I promise.\n\nI was running low on the most magical of little pills that allow me to enjoy the lactic lady of dairy delights without feeling like I'd been run over by a herd of donkeys afterwards. I knew I could buy these at the local health food/vitamin type shop near home, so off I toddle to ensure the enjoyment of a dose of cheddar later.\n\nThis was during a time when the shop only allowed a certain number of people in at a time. An older lady was peering in and struck up a conversation with me. \"I'm not sick! I promise, I've just been feeling a bit run down is all.\"\n\nI sympathised and told her I was just popping in for one thing and she was welcome to go ahead of me. \"Oh no!\" Says she. \"I don't even know what I need, I just need something to perk me up.\"\n\nMy mother, being a very holistic type of woman, liked to tell me all of the benefits of various tinctures and herbs that would change my life. She gave up on these when it became clear nothing could cure my terrible sense of humour but I digress.\n\n\"My mother swears by evening primrose oil,\" I said. \"It may be worth a try if you just want a little something in general, though I can't promise results as this is all second hand information.\"\n\nHer eyes lit up, her mouth opened, it was as though I'd pulled a rabbit out of a hat then started playing jazz with it.\n\n\"That's it!! That's what I wanted! I'd forgotten the name!\" She couldn't thank me enough, I'd had a moment of brilliance and she was determined to let me know how grateful she was.\n\nA couple of people stepped out so we were both welcomed inside where she immediately asked me where one might find Evening Primrose Oil?\n\n\"I'm not sure, I'm afraid I don't work here. But if I had to guess I'd think they'd be with the other supplements over there.\" It wasnt a large shop and I vaguely knew where stuff was, with the employee distracted by the only other customer checking out I thought it made sense to help the older lady figure things out.\n\nShe went a-questing for her oil, I traversed the aisles for my pills and lo, did get them.\n\nWhen she popped her head up again and saw me checking out at the till, she called out to the employee \"She deserves a raise you know! She's very good at her job, she's been so helpful!\" The employee and I chuckled as I reiterated that I didn't work there, but appreciated the sentiment. \n\nI finished the transaction as the older lady absorbed this information. \n\nShe wasn't sure what to think, she'd been so certain, this was the only way she knew to show her appreciation, unless...\n\nHer face broke out in a beam of determination as she looked towards the actual employee and thus spake;\n\n\"Well she SHOULD have a job! And she DESERVES a pay rise!\"\n\n\"Thank you for that but I already have a job. Its a nice thought though.\" I said, already heading back to the front doors.\n\n\"But you're so good at this one, go on! Offer her a job! You wouldn't regret it you know!\" \n\nI all but leapt through the doors as the poor employee did her best to promise the woman that they weren't trying to avoid offering me a job, it just didn't seem like I wanted one and yes they were just as good as me and yes they promised they would offer me a job again if I ever pop in just please let them ring her up etc etc.\n\nDefinitely a happy ending for me though, I got a delicious cheesy pasta dinner!",

    "body": "This was inspired by the popularity of my quick comment on the topic in the 30+ thread. Undereye circles have a variety of causes and will have different symptoms and treatments. It's possible to have a combination of several problems. I apologize for the lack of scientific references, I'm simply too lazy and making this post took longer than expected. Without further comment, this is the extent of my knowledge. Please comment to add any information or your experiences!\n\n\n#Brown circles\n\n**Caused by** hyperpigmentation from sun exposure, rubbing or hormonal problems. Sometimes genetic, more common if you have darker skin, but can happen with lighter skin too.   \n**Prevent by** using sunscreen, having good UV screening sunglasses, not rubbing the eyes.  \n**Treat with** ingredients that fight excessive pigmentation like vitamin C, mild retinoids, licorice root extract, arbutin, linoleic acid, niacinamide... [This thread on lightening ingredients by effect may be useful.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3r5ptc/psa_lightening_ingredients_split_up_by_mode_of/?st=j20qlpbm&sh=721abedd)   \n**Hide with** yellow based correctors.\n\n---\n\n#Purple circles\n\n**Caused by** circulation and drainage problems and congestion (sometimes caused by allergies or infections), capillary fragility.  \n**Prevent by** sleeping on your back to minimize the effect of gravity on blood pooling. Dehydration can cause capillary fragility so stay hydrated.  \n**Treat with** ingredients that promote circulation like caffeine, green tea and vitamin K. Horse chestnut extract and flavonoids (especially oligomeric proanthocyanidins) help strengthen capillary walls. Some medical conditions like undergoing dialysis or diabetes can cause lowered vitamin C levels in the body which has been linked to capillary fragility, supplementation may be effective in these cases. There isn't much research on skin oils but some of them are claimed to have capillary strengthening effects (rosehip seed oil, hazelnut oil, neroli oil, rose oil) and circulation improving effects (coriander oil, eucalyptus oil, cypress oil, evening primrose oil, geranium essential oil). There is anecdotal evidence in this thread that if you have persistent sinus problems a nasal spray (specifically Flonase) can be quite effective.   \n**Hide with** orangey correctors. Yellow correctors are the opposite on the color wheel but using the opposite color can create an ashy effect on skin.\n\n---\n\n#Grey/blue circles\n\n**Caused by** genetics (eye position in the socket and the amount of adipose tissue under the skin); thin skin (skin can be naturally thin, thin with age, prolonged use of some steroids can cause skin thinning); fatigue, stress and lack of sleep.  \n**Prevent by** using antioxidant ingredients, stopping smoking and using sunscreen. UV damage and smoking can cause premature skin aging, including thinning skin. Get enough rest.   \n**Treat with** ingredients that help thicken the skin by boosting collagen production like retinoids, vitamin C and zinc. Keeping the skin moisturized helps plump it up, too. If it's stress and fatigue related nourising and cooling eye masks may help.  \n**Hide with** salmon and peach correctors.\n\n---\n\n#Puffiness and bags\n\n**Caused by** circulation problems, allergies, congestion (can be a co-symptom of purple circles), fluid retention (fatigue, hormonal), or genetically having quite thick fat pads under the eyes (can start sagging with age).  \n**Prevent by** sleeping on your back to make it more difficult for blood to pool under the eyes; staying hydrated and not using too much salt. As skin loses elasticity with aging and becomes more \"loose\" it could allow more fluids and blood to pool in the undereye area, so helping elastin production with anti-aging ingredients could be preventative.    \n**Treat with** caffeine, green tea and vitamin K, cool compresses. Massages can help with fluid retention. You could make green tea ice cubes, wrap them in gauze so they aren't too cold, and use them as a compress, pressing gently from the corner of the eye outward to massage. Caffeine is great because it also helps if the cause is having naturally above average fat deposits under the eyes - it helps shift the cell metabolism from accumulating to burning fat, so the fat cells in the hypodermis shrink. Anti-inflammatory ingredients can help with swelling if it's caused by allergies or chronic infections. If you have allergy or chronic congestion problems do consult with your doctor.   \n**Hide with** a concealer slightly lighter than your skin, applied only in the shadow of the eye bag. Applying a lighter concealer on the bag itself will highlight it. Some facial primers and skincare products designed for undereye bags have a film former than can help tighten and compress the area. The facial primers tend to be ones designed for aging skin and have to sort of smoothed on, not patted on, for the film former to work the best.  \n\n\n---\n\n**Quick edit to add** - dark circle colour can be affected by skin pigmentation. \n\nBlue and purple circles can show up as more brownish or grayish with darker skin. \n\nBlue circles can sometimes appear somewhat purplish too, especially on very pale skin. Since it is blood vessels showing through the skin with very deep set eyes and/or thin low pigmentation skin the amount of vessels showing though can be nearing the look of lack of circulation or capillaries leaking blood.\n\nExtreme purple circles can look almost dark blue.",

My fatigue and brain fog are through the roof, I'm bloated, my whole body aches and I have insomnia with terrifying nightmares.\n\nI'm not saying that the interventions I did are bad or not working but I want to say sometimes it just sucks and it's NOT because you're trying hard enough. God knows I am.\n\nPray for me I get my period soon - 4 days to go.\n",

Then it is a gnrh analog to stop all hormones then add them back in. Then a hysterectomy with removal of ovaries as well and adding back in hormones as the last step. \n(even tho ssris are are listed as a first line many Dr's think they miss the point and that stopping the cycle is more important) \n\nLiving well and healthy will just make your body work good, it wil not affect how your brain reacts to your own normal natural hormones.

As many of us do, I was looking for supplements to support my PCOS which I’ve been dealing with for almost 20 years. I’ve had great success with evening primrose oil and have taken it consistently over the years with no issues. I’ve read good things about inositol especially 40:1. I got the powder version and was taking it consistently in the evenings. I noticed when I first took it that it made me very sleepy. Outside of that I had some good effects I thought it helped me lose a little weight and my periods were consistent. After about 3 months+ I noticed that I started to gain a bit of weight and my mental health took a dive. My anxiety was very high and I even felt a little depressed. All the time. But then I googled side effects of inositol and saw a few Reddit posts from people who had experienced a similar thing. At first I ignored it because the majority of reviews say great things. Then the other day I woke up so anxious. I couldn’t shake it the whole morning and I was ready to talk to my doctor about anxiety meds. Then I remembered what I had read previously and made the connection. I’ve stopped taking it for about 3 days and my anxiety has decreased immensely. I am hoping that with some increased exercise and diet I can drop some lbs. Moral of the story listen to your body. I just wanted to share my experience since I know we are all trying to find ways to manage our PCOS. ",

I got diagnosed with sleep apnea in the fall and have been on cpap since then and I felt tired in the way I was before cpap (which was basically feeling like a zombie). I assumed the depression and anxiety spiral it sent me down was related to being tired not the inositol itself but who knows. The thought of going back to being that tired all the time made me want to break down crying. I don’t weigh myself so I have no clue if it affected my weight. And I never checked my blood sugar so I can’t speak to that either. As far as I can tell I had only negative side effects.\n\n\nIn researching things more it sounds like some people that did badly on the combo inositol had luck with the just myo inositol so I am going to give that a try just in case but I am a little worried about taking it again in any capacity 🥲 there are so many supplements recommended for pcos and everyone’s bodies are different it really sucks to navigate. And doctors have never heard of these supplements so it sucks even more being alone in trying to navigate!\n\n\nEditing to add, I only took it for a month.

If I didn’t eat something immediately, I’d throw up. So I basically had to eat every two hours or so. Obviously this led to quite a bit of weight gain. And my cycles were the longest they had ever been (100+ days).\n\nI didn’t make the connection immediately but as soon as I did, I stopped taking it and things immediately improved. My weight is back to normal, my cycles are better (still not perfect, but definitely nothing above the 100 day range). Most importantly, no nausea. I can feel actual hunger and if I’m out of the house without food for a few hours, it’s a manageable feeling. \n\nMy working theory is that we all have different causes or types of PCOS, and mine might be driven by gut dysbiosis (I have other symptoms that support this theory). If this is true, then inositol would feed the bad bacteria in the gut and cause even more of an imbalance, making things a lot worse. \n\nI’m now diving into gut health (real gut health, not the surface level stuff that social media influencers are always on about) and it looks promising. I’m gradually changing my diet to include more probiotics, prebiotics, polyphenols and gentle anti-fungal/anti-bacterial herbal supplements that supposedly only target the bad guys. \n\nI’m only a few weeks in, so it’s hard to say if it’s working, but I definitely feel a lot better. I’m also finishing up my first period since starting this and it’s been completely painless. The first painless one I’ve ever had… \n\nCurious if anyone had a similar experience with inositol and/or has looked into gut dysbiosis as a driver of their PCOS.",

Not a fucking thing. \n\nBeing dilated to 4 for 3 weeks. Has it gone any further than that? Nope. \n\nPineapple and pineapple juice. I think I must have eaten at least a dozen pineapples, in pieces of course. Nope, nothing. \n\nSquats. Hah, pulled a muscle, but no closer to labor. \n\nGetting sick, so that I am absolutely miserable, because what better time to go into labor than when I'm sick? Nope, nada, \n\nThunderstorms and a strawberry moon. Weird pressure and rain and howling wind and odd lunar things...of course bound to induce labor, right? She slept through all of it. \n\nOne failed trip to L and D 2 weeks ago, because of course after making a fool of myself, she'd decide to actually get things going, right? Nope, properly abashed baby has decided to be abashed and lay low. \n\nThe fact that I have had so many damn kids that she should be able to walk herself out of there and my doctor is shocked that we have made it to 39 weeks? Yeah, she is just comfortable. \n\nThe fact that when I, uh, check manually to see if I can find her head, I can't get past the second knuckle of my middle finger before I smack her in the head...She's like three inches from entering the world and I am not in labor.

[William Michael](https://imgur.com/a/wEMb8Z5) joined us on February 13th, nine days before his due date. Here’s how it all went down. LONG!! \n\n\n**Day before labor (38+3)**\n\n\nI woke up on Friday feeling completely normal. I was 0 cm dilated and my cervix was high and thick at my 38 week appointment on Tuesday, and my OB said “yep, nothing imminent.” I pumped for nipple stimulation for an hour in the morning, bounced on my birthing ball a bunch, did [this squat video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SkbHdjPYho) several times, had an induction acupressure massage in the afternoon, and then walked the 5 miles back to my apartment listening to a few episodes of Evidence Based Birth. During the walk, I really noticed increased pelvic pressure compared to earlier in the week – it felt like he was about to just explode out my abdomen. When I got home I pumped for another hour. A few days earlier I had made a huge batch of the famous “eggplant babies” eggplant parmesan from Scalinis, which I polished off for dinner. My husband and I had sex around 9pm and almost immediately after I started having bouts of low period cramping accompanied by pressure in my lower back. It wasn’t painful or consistent, and I fell asleep as usual that night.\n\n\n**Day of labor (38+4)**\n\n\nI woke up very early and realized right away I was still having the period cramping and lower back pressure every few minutes. They were mild but coming regularly. I pumped for an hour, had coffee and breakfast, did some more squats, and walked a half an hour to acupuncture listening to more of Evidence Based Birth. During the hour of laying down, focusing, and meditating at acupuncture I realized these might actually be contractions. Walking back from acupuncture the pelvic pressure from his head in my crotch started to really hurt. When I got home around noon I laid down, put on the Office, and started timing the contractions on my app. I was surprised to see they were 5-1-1, and my app told me several times “Time to go to the hospital,” but they still weren’t painful. I called the OB on call and she told me it could be early labor or it could fizzle out, and to call back if they remained at 5-1-1 and they got so painful that I couldn’t talk through them or my water broke. Disappointed, I felt sure it was prodromal labor and decided to do the Miles Circuit. After the Miles Circuit my husband came home and around 6pm we ordered pizza for dinner from our favorite pizza place – I loaded mine up with jalapenos, spicy pickled peppers, sriracha, and red pepper flakes. (This would later prove to be a mistake!!) \n\n\nAround 7pm something changed. Contractions were slowly becoming more painful, especially in my back. I laid down on my side in the Miles Circuit position in bed and watched some Netflix, continuing to time them and focusing on my breath. Still 5-1-1. As they got more painful I moved to my birthing ball. At 10:30 I called the on-call doctor back and told her they had reached the point I couldn’t talk through them. She seemed skeptical but told me to come on in to get checked out. I was sure I was overreacting but I knew I wasn’t going to be able to sleep through them so why not go in and see what’s going on. We quickly finished shoving clothes and toiletries in our half-packed bags, grabbed some goldfish and gummy worms, and headed out, sure that we would be returning home in a few hours. \nDuring the 15 minute drive to the hospital I had 4 mega contractions that were extremely painful and I had to vocalize through them. My husband had googled how to get to the hospital before and wasn’t following the GPS directions and I could have killed him if I could have talked. \n\n\nWe got to triage at 11pm. The nurse checked me and I was only 1cm dilated, cervix was thick, and baby was at -2 station. I was so disappointed I wasn’t more dilated but wasn’t surprised. She hooked me up to the monitors and baby sounded great. The staff decided to keep me in triage for a few hours to see if I progressed, and if I hadn’t we would head home. At this point, I was loudly vocalizing through contractions and getting through them by standing and leaning on the bed, swaying my hips from side to side. Our bags were still in the car so I didn’t have my comb to squeeze, so I used the prongs of a phone charger instead. My husband and I had taken a Lamaze class and were all prepared with several positions he could help me labor in, but he realized quickly I did NOT want to be touched or even looked at during contractions. I had several poops and my bloody show. (FWIW I never noticed losing my mucus plug.) We put on a few podcasts but it was in one ear out the other for me. They did not test me for C***d since I had it over the holidays. We could take our masks off when we were alone, and put them back on when staff came into the room. \n\n\nThe nurse re-checked me at 3am, and I was only 1.5 cm dilated, but due to the horrendous back labor I was experiencing they decided to admit me. Yay!! We got to our room and I met our new nurse. They asked if I wanted the epidural. All throughout my pregnancy, I was hoping and planning to get to at least 5cm before getting the epidural, but I had now been awake for 24 hours straight and knew I needed to sleep if I was going to have this baby. So I said let’s do it. They started my fluids which took about 45 minutes and I continued to labor leaning against the bed, moaning through the pain. When they checked me pre-epidural I was now 2cm dilated and 70% effaced, with the baby still at -2 station. \n\n\nThe anesthesiologist came right away after my fluids were done. All throughout my pregnancy I was so confused about how people sit still while contracting during the epidural but I don’t know, somehow I just did it. I agree with the other moms who compared the feeling to a beesting, it really wasn’t bad at all. It slowly started to take. In went the catheter without issue. But after about a half an hour, I realized it was supposed to be fully functional at this point and I still had a large window of pain on my front right side and back right side. My nurse helped me roll onto my side to let gravity disperse the drugs, but it remained excruciatingly painful. The top-up button I could press every 20 minutes did absolutely nothing. I threw up the pizza we had for dinner from the pain and knew I wouldn’t be eating there again for a while. My amazing nurse Marie called the anesthesiologist back and she gave me a bolus of more pain meds, which didn’t totally take away the breakthrough pain but made it manageable. My nurse gave me a peanut ball to put between my legs to help with dilation. She told me it was the best peanut ball on the floor – her name was Giselle and she was famous for her dilation powers. Let’s do this Giselle. I believe in you. At this point it was 6am and we were able to rest. I slept on and off until about 8, getting woken up every 15 or so from my shallow sleep by the blood pressure cuff. \n\n\n**Day of delivery (38+5)**\n\n\nAfter 2ish hours of “sleep” I was up, feeling surprisingly rested. I texted and called family and friends to let them know we had been admitted and it was baby day. Everyone’s excitement helped me feel more energized. I drank a ginger ale slowly for the sugar and we put on HGTV.\n\n\nAt 10am they checked me again and I was 5cm! Go Giselle! 90% effaced. The breakthrough contraction pain had returned with a vengeance, up came the ginger ale rather violently. My nurse came rushing in and asked what happened and I told her I threw up – the baby did not like that and had decelerated. We repositioned onto my other side and his heart rate returned to normal. Marie kindly told me, my dear your just threw up, take off your mask. She called the anesthesiologist, I got another bolus and started to feel better. \n\n\nMy contractions were apparently a little too spaced out, so they decided to start me on the lowest dose of Pitocin. Baby tolerated it fine. I ordered a coffee after briefly worrying would it make me poop? And then decided I couldn’t care less and I needed a little caffeine. It was snowing outside and I just felt remarkably calm and relaxed. My husband and I watched some TV, FaceTimed more family, and talked about the little man we were about to meet. On some level I was still expecting Marie to come back in and tell me, we’re actually going to send you home, today’s not the day, false alarm.\n\n\nBut around 11:30am I was feeling excruciating breakthrough pain again. I called in Marie and she returned with the doctor, who said “She might be complete.” What?! There’s no way, I thought. I just got here. I can’t push. I don’t know how. They went to check me and within a second of lifting up my gown the doctor said “YUP! Go time! Let’s call pediatrics!” I was fully dilated with bulging water and baby was at +1. At that moment my water broke. There was a little bit of meconium but they assured me it would be okay and just explained that meant they would take him to the warmer to check him out right when he was born. We also talked about how since I was on Zoloft my whole pregnancy he might not cry right away and not to be alarmed. \n\n\nWhile we waited for baby to descend to +4, Marie explained to me how to push. So I was feeling really guilty about this because I was NOT active during pregnancy (first trimester morning sickness, second trimester moving to a new city and starting WFH, third trimester terrible SPD and sacroiliac pain) and was really afraid I wouldn’t be strong enough to push him out. Let me just say it wasn’t an issue!\n\n\nAt 12:30 it was time to start pushing. Marie told me to take my mask off again and this time I kept it off. My husband held one leg and Marie held the other. I did one push with Marie and she said STOP! Apparently I was a very effective pusher and we needed to wait for the doctor to come back because he was going to come fast. The doctor got there at 12:45 and it was go time. I pushed for just under 20 minutes (6 contractions). My team was so supporting and validating, telling me I was doing amazing and I would meet him in minutes. Honestly I felt zero pain in my vaginal area, just the contraction pain in my epidural windows. No ring of fire. During the 6th contraction at 1:04pm I heard my husband’s tone change and he said “Oh my god!!!!” and suddenly there was a huge, warm, slippery, purple thing on my chest. I instinctively reached for him but truly did not realize it was my baby for several seconds. He was quiet but I was so shellshocked I didn’t even panic. They suctioned his mouth and nose and he started to scream. It was such a beautiful sound. Oh my god, my baby is on my chest. They let me hold him for a minute before the pediatric team took him to the warmer and my husband followed. \n\n\nMy placenta came out without me even realizing it because I was so focused on watching them work on my baby. He continued to scream beautifully and I tried to hear what the nurses were saying across the room. My doctor “massaged” (lol) my uterus and told me it wasn’t contracting as fast as she would like, so they were going to give me a few meds to help it go down. Do whatever you gotta do I said, again barely registering because I was so focused on my son. I had one minor labial tear requiring a few stitches. The peds nurse called over to me “8 pounds 1 ounce, mama!” and the pediatrician came over to tell me he looked perfect, even with the meconium and Zoloft. \n\n\nFinally (after what was probably only a few minutes) he was back on my chest, and immediately started rooting for the breast. It was so freaking magical and cool. I breastfed him for about an hour, just staring at him in awe, stroking his perfect tiny feet and smooth tummy. My husband texted family and friends he was here. He was literally the most gorgeous, perfect thing I had ever seen in my entire life. \n\n\n**Recovery**\n\n\nSoon we headed to the postpartum unit. We had a beautiful private room and we met our new nurse who was an angel as well. I was suddenly beyond ravenous and ordered a turkey sandwich from the cafeteria – I was dying for deli meats my entire pregnancy. Oh my god, it was so freaking good. My son continued to nurse on and off as we half-watched the Olympics and stared at him in admiration. That night we decided to send him to the nursery for 2 hours at a time between feeds, which I really did not think I would do, but it turned out to be absolutely crucial that we got those bits of rest. \n\n\nWe are now home with our little boy after 2 blissful days on the postpartum floor. The learning curve has been steep but I am in absolute newborn heaven. Part of me wants 600 more babies as soon as possible, but another part of me just wants to go back and relive the birth of my son over and over again for the rest of my life. I was worried I wouldn’t feel a connection to him as I have struggled with anxiety and depression my whole life, and I also experienced a good amount of gender disappointment due to some gender-based trauma in my past, but let me say this. If I could Build-A-Bear my dream child, I would choose my son down to the eyelash a million out of a million times. \n\n\nWhile I was blessed with a pretty textbook pregnancy, the anxiety I experienced about something going wrong was excruciating and at times almost unbearable. I did have two miscarriages before this and just felt overwhelmingly convinced that I was not going to get to take my baby home this time either. The panic shifted from miscarriage to genetic issues to stillbirth to birth trauma over the course of my nine months, even though I take Zoloft and was in regular therapy. I hope my story can help the other anxious mamas out there remember that sometimes, everything goes right. I don’t know what I did to deserve the birth of my near-dreams or my angel child, but right now I am just soaking up the happiness that I was somehow granted. \n\n**At home labor induction methods**\n\nI was sure I was going to go past 40w as a FTM, but I really didn't want that to happen, so I did all the tips and tricks to ripen my cervix at home. No idea if any of it actually worked or if I would have always given birth when I did, but it at least made me feel like I was doing something! Here were my methods:\n\nStarting at 36w: 4 cups of red raspberry leaf tea daily, 4 medjool dates daily, using a birthing ball instead of a chair whenever possible, walking 30-60 minutes a day with at least 15 minutes of curb walking or side-stair walking\n\nStarting at 37w: 1300 mg of evening primrose oil inserted vaginally every night, squats daily\n\nStarting at 38w: acupuncture 3x/week, pumping 1-2 hours a day, sex every other day\n\n*Moms, you are all incredible. Any way you give birth is so powerful and amazing. I am in total awe of the strength of women and just so grateful I got to experience pregnancy and birth.*",

    "body": "This post was inspired by one asking [People with oily skin, do you follow a different routine around your periods?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/qe0ah4/people_with_oily_skin_do_you_follow_a_different/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Which was once a whole hobby of mine 😂  because I had acne, sensitive skin *and* PMDD (Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, which is basically PMS, only depression-level). \n\nMy skin *always* flared up in the two weeks before, and as u/kaliroger said, it felt like all my progress would go down the drain every month 😅 It felt like a never-ending battle. And even derms would be like: that's that hormonal acne 🤷🏽‍♀️ That, and my terrifying PMDD got me real desperate to figure out what I could do to make life better. And I did! 😆\n\nI figured how to work WITH my cycle instead of being an unwilling participant and simply hating it... which, I really did *hate* it 😅 People usually call this \"cycle syncing\" or [\"cycle mapping\"](https://www.focusboosterapp.com/blog/menstrual-cycle-mapping-how-women-can-improve-their-productivity-and-health-period/), and it can be done to great effect with exercise, skin, nutrition, mood - the whole holistic package! Now I'm at peace with my cycle, and appreciate it for what it is, how it serves as a reminder of my connection with nature... and keeps me humble 😐 Sounds hippy dippy, but what can I say... I *am* hippy dippy 😂\n\n\n✨ I do STRONGLY recommend any of y'all with a period to TRACK YOUR CYCLE. Tracking my cycle allowed me to catch a serious health problem very early. Thankfully, I was able to seek treatment ASAP, and have a clean bill of health today 😌🙏🏽 If there's one thing you take away from this post, let it be \n#TRACK YOUR PERIOD \n\n\nI use [the Clue app](https://helloclue.com/), and have for four or five years. Now I have Data with a capital \"D\" about my cycle 😂\n\nSo this is how you can use skincare to support your skin health throughout, and prevent hormonal acne as much as possible, by having good foresight! \n\nThere are four phases to the menstrual cycle, and each causes hormonal changes in the integumentary system - skin, hair and nails. \n\n#🌑 WEEK 1: Menstruation - Soothe and hydrate\n\n*Low estrogen, low progesterone, prostaglandins at the end of bleeding*\n\n* Day 1 is counted as the first day you experience bleeding, so you might be having cramps, stomach trouble and all sorts of discomfort, but relief from the hormonal buildup has also started to happen! You'll feel your energy levels and body begin to gain strength again. You may have stopped getting new pimples and breakouts, but your skin is at it's most sensitive... you may also still be breaking out 😅 Period stuff is YMMV at its finest 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\n* Focus on soothing and repairing your skin. Think damage control, and supporting your skin's wound HEALING ability. Use soothing ingredients and products that you KNOW are tried and tested for you, that your skin likes. No new products! \n\n* Right after your period ends, you might experience dehydration, due to a sudden rise in prostaglandins.  So you wanna provide extra hydration and you can use slightly more emollient/occlusive barrier repair products without fear of breaking out. Well done for getting through the winter phase, skin! 🥰 Nourishment and support for you! ❤\n\n#🌒 WEEK 2: Follicular Phase - Stimulate and experiment\n\n*High estrogen, low progesterone*\n\n* It's ✨charmed✨ week! When you feel great, you look your best, your skin is glowy and resilient, spring has sprung, vasant rithu is ON! 😆😆😆 You'll have that inner Glow, and your skin's healing ability is at an all-cycle high! \n\n* It's time to try new products! Using something new at this point in your cycle gives it the best possible shot. It's also the best time to start an active like vitamin C, that can be irritating. Yes, you may still experience irritation in the coming weeks, but it gives you the best possible start 😤 If something breaks you out this week, it *breaks you out*. It simply does *not* suit you. \n\n* Pain tolerance is also at an all-time high, so this is the best time to get waxed, threaded, etc. Not only will it hurt less, but you'll experience less irritation, and you'll heal from what irritation you do get much faster! \n\n* Ditto for any procedures like extractions, microneedling, laser, peels - hell, even actual surgical procedures! If you have the option to choose when to schedule them, pick this week in your cycle. \n\n#🌗 DAY 14/MID-CYCLE: Ovulation - Clear pores and prevent acne\n\n*Highest estrogen, low progesterone, bump in testosterone*\n\n* A spike in testosterone may cause a random pimple or two at this point, but it will heal fast, and you'll be at max glow still ☺\n\n* Acne that emerges during the second half of the cycle, during PMS, is a flaring up and inflammation of clogged pores that were *already* there. So NOW is the time, while your skin is still resilient, to focus on exfoliation and clear out all the clogged pores that would be NBD - if they didn't end up turning into acne at the end of the cycle 😅 \n\n* The Ordinary/ Minimalist Peeling Solution! This is your time to shiiiine! 😂\n\n* Now is the time for a facial, Fiddysnails's [pore cleansing method](https://glowieco.com/blogs/news/fiddysnails-jude-chao-updated-pore-clearing-method-to-remove-sebaceous-filaments) (which became a trend called [\"gritting\"](https://www.healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/gritting)), or simply a [meticulous, thorough oil cleanse](https://youtu.be/3z0YPACfhBk) to clear out clogged pores. \n\n* If you have active acne or redness, DO NOT do prolonged massage. You may spread bacteria and increase heat and inflammation. You can follow Fiddysnails's method, massaging LIGHTLY, no more than a minute, to oil cleanse - no longer than you would on a daily basis. The method will still be effective ☺\n\n* Some women may find they can do these steps in week 3, as well. Everyone's body is different. Observe your own skin, and adjust as per your own unique pattern of changes 🤗❤\n\n#🌔 WEEK 3: Luteal Phase: Oil control \n\n*Lower estrogen, rising progesterone*\n\n* This is when you may start to experience oily skin. Some women may not experience this till the end of the week, or even the start of week 4, some may start getting oily as soon as they're done with ovulation. \n\n* This week is all about oil control and gentle chemical exfoliation. 'Tis the time for CLAY MASKS and BHAs. Some people's skin can handle oil cleansing massages during this phase, mine cannot 🤷🏽‍♀️ I have sensitive skin, so I keep massages for closer to ovulation time. \n\n* You could consider upping your cleansing game one notch. If you usually rinse with only water in the morning, a gentle cleanser might help. If you use gentle cleansers already, you skin might benefit from a foaming one during this half of your cycle. Might be some options to consider - remember to observe your skin condition. Your skin's response will tell you if you're causing too much dehydration! \n\n* You want to really be getting the most use out of your BHAs and niacinamide at this stage. If you use a BHA twice a week, you could add an extra day. Ditto niacinamide. If you're already using a BHA, an AHA or azelaic acid daily or regularly, don't overdo it, stick to adding a clay mask (or two) in there. If you have dry skin, maybe a lactic acid mask. You're already doing enough 😌\n\n* Over production of oil can be somewhat balanced by providing more hydration, to balance oil-water levels. More hydration, less emollients/occlusives! \n\n* Dialling back on the thick moisturisers is a good idea. Perhaps a plain aloe gel over your serum is enough. Maybe you just use *less* moisturiser. Skip the facial oils till after your period. Cut down the number of steps in your routine. There's a lot you can do to handle sebum production and prevent breakouts, simply by holding back on over-moisturising at this point. Less is definitely more! \n\n#🌔 WEEK 4: Cool and soothe pre-menstrual inflammation\n\n*Low estrogen, high progesterone*\n\n* Your skin will now be peak sensitivity and oiliness, and you're probably breaking out 🙃 Autumn is upon us, and the body is withdrawing to deal with Very Important Inner Matters 🧐\n\n* As in the menstrual phase, you wanna avoid new products. Use soothing products you know your skin likes. For me that's mixing a quarter teaspoon zinc oxide powder into my night moisturiser, with three or four drops MCT oil to offset the slight drying effect. My skin is visibly calmed the next morning 😌 Work smarter, not harder! 😂❤\n\n* Keeping your face cool helps calm and soothe breakouts, preventing them from getting worse. Doing soothing, cooling face packs - aloe, potato, cucumber, oats, gel packs... All of that really helps to prevent the sensitivity from resulting in actual pimples, and speeds healing. I have a [DIY gel masks post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/pq4apu/how_to_make_diy_gel_masks_with_xanthan_gum/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), if that interests you. \n\n* Even just soaking oats in water for a couple hours, and then blending them smooth, keeping that in the fridge. Amazing for soothing and cooling. Add some honey for extra hydration. Yum yum 😂\n\n* Keeping aloe gel in the fridge and doing a thick layer as a mask, then washing it off is the easiest option 🤔 You could also get those DIY blank sheet masks and soak them in green or black tea and use those. If you have a sheet mask brand that suits you, using that after keeping it in the fridge... \n\n* Korean people talk about skin temperature all the time, and it's now become a mainstream thing - like how heat can trigger melanin production and worsen melasma and hyperpigmentation. Also, apparently a one degree Celsius increase in temperature can [increase sebum production by *ten percent*](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.glamour.com/story/how-to-combat-oily-shiny-skin-in-the-summertime/amp) 🤯 Cooling your skin is really effective and underrated! HIGHLY recommend for those with inflammatory acne, redness, and sensitive skin, regardless of menstrual cycle. \n\n* Cooling does NOT mean using ice directly on your face, that shit can give you burst capillaries. Extreme temperatures are never a good idea for skin!\n\n* Continue to keep your skincare light if your skin is particularly oily. And sit tight ❤ As with the seasons, this too is a phase that will pass 😌❤\n\n#In summation:\n\nMany of us who have already come a long way to figure out our own skin probably do most of these things without consciously thinking about it. After a point, you do get to a place where you intuitively react to your skin's condition, how it looks, feels, and responds to touch. For some of us, this way of structuring might just be making a connection with our menstrual cycle we weren't previously consciously aware of doing. I hope you found something of interest or value to you here ☺ \n\nFor those who are struggling with acne and hormonal breakouts, perhaps this angle of approach may be a game changer! I know that not everyone has a regular menstrual cycle AT ALL, and PCOD/PCOS can make things seem totally unpredictable and out of control. Counter-intuitively, it might be observing your skin condition that gives you clues about your menstrual cycle, instead of the other way around! Even with a regular cycle, these guidelines are not hard and fast. Each phase rolls over into the next without clear demarcation, the labels are merely for ease of understanding 😅 Hopefully you find some info here that helps you make the best of your personal situation and get to know your own personal patterns well ❤\n\nViewing our bodies and our natural cycles as something to be conquered or ignored usually leads to resentment and anger towards ourselves, in my experience 😅 It did for me, anyway. I was antagonistic towards my body. Competitive, rather than collaborative. There's a whole patriarchy angle to that, but I'm not gonna get into it 😂 Embracing our feminine energy, and our connection with nature through our own bodies can be a profound, self-actualising journey on every level, and skin can be an amazing entry point to that. [Soft power!](https://carnegieendowment.org/2020/12/15/case-for-south-korean-soft-power-pub-83406#:~:text=Clearly%2C%20South%20Korea's%202020%20wins,co%2Dopting%20rather%20than%20coercing.) 😤 South Korea knows what's up! \n\n\n\nHere are a few SKINCARE ARTICLES on the menstrual cycle, that I used as reference: \n\n✨ [Clean Beauty School article](https://cleanbeautyschool.com/cycle-syncing-skincare/) \n\n✨ [This Is When Your Skin Will Be Amazing, According To Your Period](https://medium.com/@GlowHQ/this-is-when-your-skin-will-be-amazing-according-to-your-period-6e368b7c6e8f) \n\n✨ [A good, simple infographic](https://preview.redd.it/g1xfteca0bw31.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c3d5477c9798c05cf81acb5375712f13007628c2) that sums it up. I got it from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/dqmx7c/misc_anyone_with_a_menstrual_cycle_this_may/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), on r/SkincareAddiction 😆🙏🏽\n\n✨ [Another infographic with specific hormone level percentages](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJgfn8DM4aw/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) \n\n\nHere are a few ARTICLES ON CYCLE-SYNCING:\n\n✨ [The Menstrual Cycle: Nutrition, Training & Fat Loss](https://blog.ultimateperformance.com/the-menstrual-cycle-nutrition-training-fat-loss/) \n\n✨ [How To Be More Productive (Not Less!) By Harnessing The Power Of Your Menstrual Cycle](https://www.inspiringleadershipnow.com/women-in-leadership-menstrual-cycle-productivity/) \n\n✨ [Menstrual cycle mapping: How women can improve their productivity and health, period.](https://www.focusboosterapp.com/blog/menstrual-cycle-mapping-how-women-can-improve-their-productivity-and-health-period/) \n\n✨ [How to Work with Your Period, Not Against It](https://www.healthline.com/health/make-your-period-work-for-you) \n\n\n\nIf you suffer from extreme cyclic acne, PMS or PMDD, severe breast pain during PMS, etc, I would recommend you consult and take the guidance of a trained professional - there is no substitute for qualified gynaecologists, dermatologists and nutritionists. You can consult with your doctors if it is safe FOR YOU to try [seed cycling](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/seed-cycling), or take [evening primrose oil supplements](https://www.reliasmedia.com/articles/21335-evening-primrose-oil-for-symptoms-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-menopause) during the second half of your cycle. You can also check out r/PMDD.\n\nIf you're interested in being more aware and accepting of the emotional cycle that accompanies menstruation, the [Hormone Horoscope app](https://www.myhormonology.com/about/what-is-the-hormone-horoscope/) was super helpful for me, to be able to predict and adjust my behaviour and responses. It helped me get over my fear of PMDD and releasing control, by making things very matter-of-fact. Highly recommend! 😆❤\n\nI, personally, used to be a lot more careful to track my period and sync my skincare, do seed cycling etc, when I was experiencing active acne and fungal acne, PMDD, severe mastalgia (breast pain) etc. My mental health has come a LONG way since then, resulting in a huge reduction in symptoms ☺🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 I've also gotten to understand my own skin and how to care for it.\n\nThese days, I'm not super careful about the skincare aspect. My acne is well under control. My routine provides good prevention and maintenance regardless of where I am in my cycle. I'll get a few small breakouts and do a few soothing face packs during week 4, mix in zinc oxide with my night moisturiser and that's it. I no longer do seed cycling, as I find taking evening primrose oil during the second half of my cycle reduces my PMDD symptoms to a manageable level. I'm super grateful to be able to relax now that my hard work and research has paid off 😂🙏🏽\n\nIt's my hope that this will help some of y'all, too 🤗❤ Thanks for reading! Byeee!",

    "body": "Here is advice from me to me, on my next pregnancy (if there is one):  \n\n\n1. **Do less.** So much of what I spent my time doing and worrying about didn’t seem to make any difference. Red raspberry leaf tea? Dates? Birth ball exercises? Perineum massage? Evening primrose oil? Foley bulb? Castor oil? Time will tell how my recovery progresses, but as far as I can tell, these activities didn’t help with anything. I still had a difficult labor, and I still tore. Next time, I am only going to focus on drinking water, eating a balanced diet, and going for walks. \n2. **Don’t listen to your mom.** Or anyone who hasn’t had a baby in the past few years (unless they are a medical professional/expert.) My mother and aunts/older ladies simply don’t remember what it was like, and they seem to look back fondly on their experiences of birth, regardless of how traumatic they really were. My peers who have given birth recently had much more practical and helpful advice. \n3. **You might not “know it” when “it” happens.** I didn’t know what Braxton Hicks contractions felt like until very far along in my pregnancy, despite having them for months at that point. I don’t know what early labor feels like. I don’t know what “let down” feels like. I couldn’t tell when my milk came in. And I still don’t know what “active labor” is! Next time, I’ll try to focus less on what I should be feeling, and more on what I actually feel. Just because my experiences with these things were different than other people’s does not mean that my body is broken. \n4. **Don’t set yourself up for failure.** I planned to deliver at a birth center, but since my baby was over 42 weeks, I was not able to do this. I think I knew all along that my birth would be later than 42 weeks, and this ended up putting so much pressure on me and my baby, that I think it contributed to my very long labor and pregnancy. I won’t be delivering/planning to deliver at a place that puts these constraints on something that is out of my control. \n5. **A birth plan is great…**but the person who really makes your birth plan is your baby. As mentioned above, my baby wasn’t ready to come out, so my birth plan essentially went out the window. Yes, do your research and be prepared for what may happen and what your options will be, but birthing is a team sport. \n6. **Enjoy it more.** I want to take more photos of my growing bump. I want to get a prenatal massage. I want to be less stressed about things outside of my control. I want to frame my sonogram pictures. \n7. **Stay off the internet!** As helpful as this sub was, I found myself constantly checking back to see what everyone else was thinking and worrying about. I learned about so many things that I didn’t know I should be worried about (Burning candles? Sugar alcohols? Sleeping on the right vs. left side? Sunscreen?) If my OB/Midwife doesn’t mention it to me, I’m not going to worry about it. \n8. **I won’t be sharing my due date.** Maybe this will help to fend off the dozens of “baby yet?” texts that I received in the weeks surrounding my due date. Next pregnancy, it’ll be a general time frame instead. \n\nThings I did right: \n\n1. Bought the big pregnancy pillow. \n2. Ate what I could to survive morning sickness (and ate every two hours). \n3. Stayed hydrated. \n4. Deep cleaned my house and car before baby arrived. \n5. Read a book on baby care. I didn’t have much familiarity with babies before I had mine (especially newborns), and reading just a few paragraphs each night before bed helped me to be prepared for all the weird stuff that they do. To me, this was time much better spent than reading about labor (and that’s coming from someone who had a somewhat complicated labor). \n6. Waited to find out the baby’s sex at birth, and waited to choose her name until I met her. This was an incomparable added layer of excitement for myself and my family (but no judgment to people who find out ASAP). \n7. Established a prenatal vitamin routine *before* I got pregnant. \n8. Took the stool softener offered at the hospital (and for the first week postpartum.) If you know, you know. \n9. Bought some used maternity jeans. I practically lived in these, and I actually found them to be very comfortable! \n10. Tried not to judge other mothers/parents-to-be. This is harder said than done, but I can tell already that it is a skill I will be practicing for years to come! \n\nLooking back, these things were not as bad as I was expecting (but I acknowledge might be bad for others): \n\n1. The glucose test. Mine tasted like melted lime popsicles, and I felt totally fine after drinking it. \n2. Cervical checks. Yes they were uncomfortable, but they were not as bad as I was expecting, and they let me know how things were progressing. \n3. Pregnancy brain. I know there’s a debate as to whether or not this is a real thing, but I didn’t notice any lapse in my mental abilities (except in the first trimester when I was exhausted). \n4. My boobs didn’t get bigger exactly, but they really filled out, and I am much happier with them now than I was before I got pregnant. \n\nThat’s my advice to future me, should I get pregnant again. Every pregnancy is different, and I’m sure that it’s even more difficult the second time around. Thanks for reading!",

Lately I’ve felt like a slave to my menstrual cycle since my cycles have been getting shorter and shorter, but really there’s not much I can really do about that! My therapist recommended to track my cycle on a paper calendar and make sure that I have “gentle week(s)” during my luteal phase. Having a visual reminder has been really helpful with queuing me into being more forgiving of myself.",

    "body": "ETA: I am NOT advocating trying these methods without consulting a medical professional. PLEASE SPEAK WITH A PROFESSIONAL FIRST. This is important because a) what you think is hormonal acne may not be hormonal acne, in which case an androgen inhibitor can mess you up, and b) there may be an underlying cause for your hormonal imbalance that needs to be addressed. Thanks to /u/satisphoria for suggesting this edit. Please please do not try things that can mess with your hormones without talking to a doctor first. \n\nI've been seeing lots of posts lately asking for hormonal acne help (and I myself am a hormonal acne sufferer!), so I decided to do some research tonight. \n\n**Causes of hormonal acne**\n\nFor those who haven't done the research yet, read here! Others feel free to skip on to the next section.\n\nAccording to [the American Academy of Dermatology](https://www.aad.org/media/news-releases/hormonal-factors-key-to-understanding-acne-in-women), hormones influence excess sebum production (yech). This means that skin cells that shred can become \"abnormally sticky\" and clog up your hair follicles. That explains a lot to me (like why the \"beard\" area tends to be a prime place for hormonal acne to pop up). There can also be an excess of the *P. Acnes* bacteria being produced, and skin inflammation can increase. \n\nTo dive deeper into this, the source says that androgens play a role in this by overstimulating the oil glands. So what exactly are androgens, and why on earth do they do these nasty things to our skin?\n\n**Androgens**\n\nThere are two main androgens we should be concerned with here. I found a sample from a [lovely article on PubMed](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0625.2004.00255.x/epdf?r3_referer=wol&tracking_action=preview_click&show_checkout=1&purchase_referrer=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&purchase_site_license=LICENSE_DENIED_NO_CUSTOMER) that tells me they are called dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S from now on because goddang if that isn't a keyboardful) and androstenedione. The first thing that stands out to me, even just looking at the names, is that one of them is a sulfate. I remember that in the last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4pr2yz/hormonal_outbreak_how_do_you_change_your_routine/) I saw on hormonal acne, /u/zhene said that a sulfate-free toothpaste was helpful when managing hormonal outbreaks. Of course, YMMV applies here, but my brain immediately lightbulbed. Reading further down the PubMed article, I see why: \"DHEA-S is the androgen with by far the highest serum concentration in both sexes and is considered to be the most important regulator of sebum secretion\". Of course, my sample chops off after that point, but hey, that was useful. Connecting these two sources together, it seems as though DHEA-S could be the culprit of the overproduction of sebum and thus the acne. A factoid that I found: [this article](http://www.whitelotusclinic.ca/blog/dr-fiona-nd/high_dhea_testosterone_pcos/) says that a higher level of DHEA-S is one of the markers for PCOS. As I'm sure many of you know, one of the symptoms of PCOS (among others such as hirsutism and the string of pearls cysts on the ovaries) is hormonal acne. \n\nSo what I'm getting out of this: to help control your hormonal acne, you really need to have something that will control/inhibit the production of DHEA-S in particular, or something that's REALLY REALLY GOOD at controlling excess sebum production.\n\n**Spearmint**\n\nThe first thing I thought I'd look into was spearmint. Lots of people swear by spearmint tea or spearmint capsules when they give advice on hormonal acne. However, I am the absolute worst. Translation: I hate drinking tea and taking pills. So I thought, what about using spearmint topically? Here's what I found out:\n\nI got some information from [Essential Oil Informer](http://essentialoilsinformer.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-spearmint-oil/). It uses some credible sources to back up its claims, like the Journal of Microbiology Research, so I'm inclined to say that this particular article is reliable. I did sleuth that journal to back up the claims they are making, and they're all in an [article I found there](http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.j.microbiology.20110101.01.html). \n\nIt looks like the components of spearmint essential oil are \"Alpha Pinene, Beta Pinene, Carvone, Cineole, Caryophyllene, Linalool, Limonene, Menthol and Myrcene\". I'm over here like, mmm, menthol. Sounds cooling and soothing. Sounds promising-ish. Next up, the bacteria it is useful in combating: \"Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Pasturella multocida\". The fungal pathogens it's useful in combating: \"Aspergillus niger, Mucor mucedo, Fusarium solani, Botryodiplodia theobromae, and Rhizopus solani\". \n\nSo this is lovely. The articles I found say that the \"active\" components of spearmint oil are the carvone and limonene. These would then be the things that have anti-androgenic qualities, if spearmint can be proven to really be anti-androgenic. There have been studies, of course, which point in that direction (namely [one in Turkey](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17310494)), but they don't really seem to come to the conclusion that spearmint is definitely anti-androgenic - only that it might be.\n\nSo that's all well and good, but all these studies are conducted with people actually ingesting spearmint, usually through tea or capsules. But for those who don't want to ingest it, can you use it topically? My research was pretty inconclusive. The most I was able to find was a thread on a message board for PCOS where someone tried [rubbing spearmint tea leaves on their chest](http://www.soulcysters.net/showthread.php/291429-spearmint-tea-experimental!) (you'll have to scroll down a bit or ctrl+f for \"topical\" to find the start of the comments about it) and then rubbing the spearmint essential oil on their chest afterwards (OH MY GOD NONONONO) to see if it helped. They did say that the hairs on their chest lightened and some that were plucked did not grow back, and thankfully discontinued rubbing the essential oil straight on their skin and went back to the tea leaves. Yikes. Speaking of which, obviously you shouldn't go rub this oil right on your skin. Much like tea tree oil, it's much too strong to use straight, you should use a carrier oil if you want to put it on your skin.\n\nIn conclusion: can spearmint essential oil be used topically to help combat your hormonal acne? The answer seems to be a resounding maybe. Since DHEA-S is produced in the adrenal glands and synthesized in the skin, I'm not sure if a topical application of spearmint oil would be \"too late\" to really block the androgen and therefore stop it from messing with sebum production when it's overproduced.\n\n**Evening Primrose Oil**\n\nOkay, y'all still with me? I know that was a pretty long rant on spearmint to end up with \"idk lol\" but I at least feel like I've got a better understanding of where it needs to be working now.\n\nSo, on to evening primrose oil. It can have [some side effects](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/eveningprimrose#cautions) when you ingest it, though this article says that many people tolerate it well in the short term. But we're talking topical here!\n\nThe first thing that jumped out to me as an \"oh hell no\" about using this stuff topically is that it goes rancid REALLY quickly, even when refrigerated. Almost every article I opened up about the stuff basically says \"not worth it, it goes rancid fast.\" However, according to Truth in Aging, it does seem to [dilute sebum production](https://www.truthinaging.com/review/what-is-it-evening-primrose-oil), which is totally what we're going for. Apparently it goes rancid quickly due to its high concentration of saturated fats. So, while it seems like it is possible to treat acne through topical use of evening primrose oil, it's much less practical than taking supplements, and you need to be careful to make sure that there's enough of a concentration of the oil to be effective.\n\nMy rant on evening primrose oil is a bit shorter than the rant on spearmint oil. I'd like to confine myself to \"is this stuff effective topically\" here just to keep the post to a reasonable length. (Actually what is reasonable though, this got way longer than I thought it was going to.) I wanted to include lots more research on how I got to my \"conclusion\" on topical spearmint oil so that I could show that I researched the crap out of it and still found very little that was conclusive. Plus I had to do a lot more piecing together of sources on spearmint than on evening primrose. \n\n**TL;DR:** Topical spearmint oil is a maybe. It's a real androgen blocker, so by the time the androgens actually get to your skin, it may be too late for the spearmint to actually block it. Topical evening primrose oil is a preference. It dilutes sebum instead of blocking androgens, so it's plausible to use it topically, but it goes rancid pretty fast. It may be more plausible to take it as a supplement, but for those who can't/don't want to take pills, you can use the oil on your skin if you're okay with the oil itself dying pretty quickly.\n\nHope this was useful to some people!",

        "body": "I'm really sorry, but this post is a mess.\n\n* Essential Oil Informer is a clickbait site that copies-and-pastes its articles from the sort of sources that think you can cure cancer with magical crystals. It is not a trustworthy medical source.\n\n* Truth in Aging is a commercial site, and its information is all geared towards selling you \"anti-aging\" products. It is also not a trustworthy medical source.\n\n* The OP wrote a section on \"what exactly are androgens\" without actually explaining what they were. Androgens, which include testosterone, are what we call \"male hormones,\" in the same way that we call estrogens \"female hormones.\" It's more complicated than that, since (for one thing) everyone needs to have a balance of both, but in general if you have more androgens than estrogens in your system, you're probably a dude, and if more estrogens, vice-versa.\n\n* PCOS, the most common cause of chronic hormonal acne in adults, is basically when you have ovaries but they're not working right, and you have higher androgen levels than you should. (Not necessarily lower estrogen levels; they might be low, or they might be normal, or high.) People with PCOS often have acne that's most heavy along the jawline, where a beard would grow. Depending on the severity of the hormonal imbalance and how long it persists, you may also grow an actual beard, as well as unusually heavy hair elsewhere on your body. Irregular and unusually painful periods are also common, as are weight gain, diabetes, depression, fatigue, infertility, random stabby pelvic pain, and assorted unpleasant vagina problems like vaginismus or a microperforate/imperforate hymen. (The easiest way to explain the symptoms of PCOS is: imagine if your body can't decide if you're pregnant, or a 16-year-old boy.)\n\n* (Despite what some people think, infertility is not a constant here - it's a common symptom, yeah, but most people with PCOS are able to become pregnant without medical intervention. Having conceived easily doesn't mean that you can't have PCOS, and having PCOS doesn't mean that you don't need birth control.)\n\n* The surfactant-type cleansing sulfates found in toothpaste have literally nothing to do with DHEA-S. The fact that \"sulfate\" is in the name of both is irrelevant: they're totally unrelated substances. \"Zinc oxide\" and \"nitrous oxide\" both end with \"oxide,\" but most physicians advise against using laughing gas as a sunscreen, or Banana Boat as an anesthetic.\n\n* People with PCOS tend to have higher-than-average levels of DHEA-S because DHEA-S is an androgen, and, like I said before, we have elevated androgen levels. Elevated androgen levels cannot be lowered by avoiding sulfate surfactants. If they could, my symptoms would have improved back when I was being a mega-hippie and using baking soda and vinegar for everything.\n\n* Some people do get skin problems from products with sulfates, but that's not a hormone thing. Surfactant-type sulfates are, y'know, surfactants, and surfactants are irritating in general; plus, some people are sensitive to specific sulfates. This is not an under-studied phenomenon.\n\n* Also, sulfate-free toothpastes often have less fluoride than other varieties, and fluoride itself can be irritating to people with sensitive skin or gums. So, the sulfates may not even be what was bothering the particular Reddit user upon whom the OP chose to base the \"sulfates mess up your hormones\" hypothesis.\n\n* Hormonal imbalances are very, very complicated. Trying to find one single hormone to blame for your problems makes as much sense as trying to find one single guy to blame for the crime rate in Florida. Which is to say that it makes no sense. Florida Man is not a real person. I'm sorry; I hope you didn't pay too much for that autograph?\n\n* Whether or not spearmint oil has any antibacterial effects is irrelevant to its usefulness as an androgen blocker, because hormones are not bacteria.\n\n* \"The articles I found say that the \"active\" components of spearmint oil are the carvone and limonene. These would then be the things that have anti-androgenic qualities, if spearmint can be proven to really be anti-androgenic.\" This is 1) not what \"active\" means and 2) completely false. We have no idea yet what substance-or-group-of-substances in spearmint seems to be acting as an androgen blocker.\n\n* It's unlikely to be limonene, though, given that someone would probbbbbbably have noticed by now if literally all citrus fruits were potent androgen blockers.\n\n* \"News At Six: Oranges Cause Impotence And Infertility In Men, Dang How Did Humanity Fail To Notice This For Thousands Of Years\"\n\n* There have in been no long-term studies on the safety of consuming large quantities of spearmint daily. For all we know some combination of ingredients in spearmint will gradually cause liver damage, if permitted to build up. Menthol can definitely be toxic in high enough concentrations; hypothetically, suppose that something else in there kept it from metabolizing, allowing it to build up to a toxic dose?\n\n* If this seems unlikely, keep in mind that black pepper and grapefruit contain ingredients capable of doing this to a number of relatively innocuous medications. I've personally made myself pretty sick with black pepper extract! Fun times.\n\n* Even aside from the lack of toxicity data, we *already know* that taking large doses of spearmint regularly can be dangerous: something in it is a strong diuretic, which means that it can make you dehydrated, make your blood pressure drop sharply, and potentially cause you to pass out. (It seems plausible to me that this something is the same thing that seems to be acting as an androgen blocker; the most popular androgen-blocking medication for PCOS, spironolactone, is also a strong diuretic, and it tastes like spearmint.)\n\n* When you're taking a normal diuretic like spiro, you can compensate by drinking more water and eating more salt and/or sugar. You won't necessarily be able to compensate *easily,* because for a lot of people (including me) it takes substantial effort, but it's at least possible. But because spearmint supplements are not standardized to keep the amount of this diuretic ingredient the same in each pill/teabag/dropperful, you never know how much of it you're getting, meaning that you never know how much water/salt/sugar you need to compensate with to stay safe. You might be fine for the course of one bottle of capsules, then get a new bottle from the same manufacturer and pass out driving to work.\n\n* If a plant has the same effects as a prescription medication, and you're wary the prescription medication, you should always be even more wary of the plant. You know what's in the pill because it's on the label. Plants, however, do not have ingredients lists - their chemical composition varies with the varietal, the weather, the soil, the water and air quality, and dozens of other factors.\n\n* If you think that you have a hormone imbalance, please talk to a doctor if you can possibly do so.",

    "body": "My post didn't get much attention when I posted it 2 years ago, but I wanted to give an update on this for anyone who might be in a similar situation now.\n\nTwo years ago, I posted here desperate to get rid of my breasts because of the pain they caused me. I had been told, repeatedly, that breast pain is normal in women by my breast care specialist. She had prescribed me evening primrose oil, which in fairness did help the pain somewhat (going from 6/10 pain spikes daily to weekly). I was not looking forward to a lifetime of carrying around and caring for bags of pain and suffering and was looking for a path to doing so.\n\nI mentioned there was no history of breast cancer in my family because when I posted, there wasn't. However, just a year after posting that, my estranged biological grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer and tested positive for BRCA1. When news finally reached us through the family grapevine, my mother and I both tested positive as well. While my mother did not want a mastectomy, I had been wanting one for years by that point, and after screening I went ahead with a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy. My doctors in Indiana were actually extremely supportive of my choice and fought insurance on my behalf!\n\nBy an incredible stroke of luck, I have managed to get what I sought after in that post two years ago: a bilateral mastectomy that was covered by insurance. I don't know if I can say that anyone else can follow my path, but I have learned a few things since my mastectomy.\n\nOne, constant breast pain is not normal. If your breast pain is more than a 3/10, to the point that people even touching it is painful - that is not normal. A bilateral masectomy will help so much. I have gone from constant pain to none, and it is FREEING. If you're suffering from breast pain like I am and doctors are being dismissive, FIND A NEW DOCTOR.\n\nTwo - if you're feeling stuck like I was, get tested for BRCA. I had it covered by insurance due to family history, but even OOP it can be just $250. It's better to be informed in this regard!\n\nThree - Trust your instincts, ladies! This kind of ties into one, but throughout this process I have doubted myself. Maybe I'll regret chopping them off, maybe the pain is all in my head, maybe maybe maybe. In the end, I am so satisfied with my choice and pain free. I have wanted this for years, and it is everything I wanted. \n\nIf any of you, now or in the future, have questions that need answers, I'm happy to answer them as best I can here or in DMs.\n\nOriginal Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/13jbto3/23f_seeking_advice_on_bilateral_breast_removal/",

I'd like to get my breasts removed- I've never been particularly fond of them, and even less so as I age. They want me to get a mammogram (just had my first one and wow that was not fun) and MRI every year for the rest of my life, you'd think just removing the darn things would be more cost effective in the long run. I'm going to discuss with my doctor if removal is a possibility but I worry that without the gene, insurance will reject it. Going to ask at my next appointment anyway.\n\nCongratulations that you were able to have them removed, and I'm glad to hear you have no regrets! That is also one of my worries, that I might look in the mirror and hate myself for removing them. But I think I'd be happier not having to deal with them!",

Also remember that every month is a new month too",

    "body": "Warning: this is long. \n\nI’ll start out with a little background on the natural birth of my first son 3.5 years earlier. \nMy first son was 8.5 lbs and the labor was really intense and long. I labored at home from 10pm to 6:30am when my contractions got really close together. I arrived at the hospital at 7am and was 7cm dilated. I was in the worst part of labor for 12 hours. I had my son at 7pm after pushing for 4 hours. He was almost born in the bag (it broke as he was crowning), so that’s partially why it took so long. I had asked the midwife about breaking my waters but she told me it would make my contractions more painful and I couldn’t imagine more pain at that point. It was a natural water birth but I couldn’t help but feel kind of traumatized from the length and exhaustion from the pain. \nFor my 2nd son, I knew I wanted a natural birth again. I’ve had issues with medications and I figured since I did it once I could do it again. The practice I’m seeing does not offer water births which worried me because I thought the only way I got through my previous birth was because of the water. \nTowards the end of my pregnancy I started having constant Braxton-Hicks contractions. It reminded me of early labor with my other son. I even went to the hospital once and realized I hadn’t progressed since my last doctor’s visit, so I knew it wasn’t real labor. At my appointments the last few weeks, the doctors mentioned that they thought my baby might be big since my belly was so big. My last son was 8.5 lbs and I gained the same amount with this pregnancy, so I figured this baby would be around 9 lbs. \nAt my 40 + 4 week appt I was 4cm dilated and 50% effaced. The ultrasound showed that the baby was doing well and had plenty of fluid, but the doctor wanted to schedule me for an induction at 40 weeks and 6 days. I was really concerned because I’ve heard pitocin contractions are much worse and I knew how painful regular contractions were. I went home and did everything possible to induce labor - had sex, orgasmed, inserted evening primrose oil vaginally, used a breast pump, ate eggplant for dinner, whatever it took to try to avoid an induction. I went to bed trying to read positive induction stories but kept reading ones that only made me more anxious. \nI woke up at 6:30 am and rolled over and felt a gush of water come out. I thought maybe I peed, but it was more than a little trickle, so I knew it had to be my water breaking. I told my husband and we decided I should try to go back to sleep since we had so many false alarms previously. So I laid down for 30 more minutes and felt a little achy but nothing else. Took a shower and boom - I had 5 strong contractions in the shower. I couldn’t keep up. I started timing and they were all less than 3 min apart. I tried drying my hair but kept stopping. I called my doula and we decided we’d figured out what to do at 8. At 8 my contractions were less than 2 min apart and I could barely scarf down some breakfast and get dressed. I spoke to my doula and she decided to head to the hospital which is much further from her. My husband came home and we decided we should get to the hospital ASAP because it was moving fast. The 15 min ride to the hospital was awful. I got there at 9am with fluid running down my legs but didn’t care. I couldn’t even sit in a wheelchair because my contractions were so much worse when I sat down. I got a triage room and had 3 contractions while just trying to change into my gown and walk to the bed. I was almost in tears from the pain but the sweet nurse kept telling me I was strong and it actually helped me. She was so patient and kind. I laid on the bed and she checked me and I was 9 cm dilated with a bulging bag (apparently my water hadn’t fully broken). She quickly wheeled me to l&d and they got me set up so fast. I told them I intended to have a natural birth and they were like “honey, you’re already almost done. You’ve done the hard part”\nI kept having really strong contractions but was stuck in the 9cm-9.5cm range for a couple of hours. My midwife offered to break my water fully if I wanted to speed things up which I knew from experience can hold things up. I got so exhausted I could barely stand and was throwing up. I knew I was running out of energy and needed to do something soon. I finally agreed for her to finish breaking my water. Once she did that, I had a 3 or 4 really intense contractions. I breathed as hard as possible through them and it really helped. I had some more that weren’t quite as bad. Once the contractions eased up I knew that pushing was coming soon. \nThe urge to push came out of nowhere. I freaked out because the midwife wasn’t in there but my doula and nurse told me not to worry. It felt like he was almost crowning but I figured I was just feeling it more since I wasn’t in the water.  \nThe midwife came in and warned me that the baby looked big but that I had enough room in my pelvis for him to fit. I thought my 8.5 lb baby was big so oh well. I pushed with 3 hard pushes in under 5 minutes and he was out. I couldn’t believe it. We all couldn’t believe how big he was. We were all more shocked to learn he was 10 lbs 10 oz. They monitored his glucose levels over the next 12 hours and he was fine. My husband and his brother were 10+lb. babies so I guess this was due to my husband’s genes. \nAnyways, I couldn’t believe how much easier my 10+lb baby birth was than my 8+lb baby birth. I also heard that laboring with your water broken is much worse, but I didn’t notice a difference. To me, labor is really painful either way, but I’d rather it go by quickly than get drawn out like my first. ",

The infundibulum within the **hair** follicle (400-600 μm deep \\[.4 mm to .6 mm\\]) is lined with a particularly dense network of dendridic cells making it the most immunologically active region, therefore this was specifically targeted for delivery. As they had previously demonstrated that particles of different sizes penetrate **follicles** to different depths, the vaccine carriers were of **1 mm** diameter to target the infundibulum. They showed that their **1 mm** silicon dioxide microparticles efficiently penetrated the **hair** **follicles** to deliver vaccine constituents to dendridic cells in the infundibulum within 1 hour of topical application. They also showed that particles remained as a depot within the **follicle** for up to 10 days contrasting with particles on the stratum corneum \\[most outward layer of skin\\] that were rapidly removed after about 1 day. Follicular delivery of vaccine carried on microparticles provides another potential approach to target the body’s largest immune organ.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6637104/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6637104/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used a .5 mm **dermaroller** for over a year.

Will now start using **1 mm** based on the above and my own experience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dermaroller Frequency**\n\nUnderstanding the predictable phases of wound healing dictates optimum timing for \\[Dermarolling\\] to obtain greatest success. Prolonging the inflammatory phase (day 1-5) will result in more growth factors. Photomodulation and lymph drainage are valuable from day 2-14 and then cosmetic rolling combined with Sonophoresis and micro-current are beneficial to assist maximum delivery of nutrients to cells. **Collagen**ase peaks at around day 14 to reorganize **collagen** fibrils, converting **collagen** III to **collagen** I and it therefore makes no sense to reinjure the skin more frequently than every 30 days.\n\nSource: [https://irp.cdn-website.com/315280e8/files/uploaded/setterfield-\\_needle-depth.pdf](https://irp.cdn-website.com/315280e8/files/uploaded/setterfield-_needle-depth.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 0.5 mm - use 1 time a week \\[shortest length that creates **collagen**\\]\n* 0.75 mm - use every 2 weeks\n* 1 mm - use every 4 weeks\n* 1.5 mm - use every 5 weeks\n\nSource: [https://dermarolleronlinestore.co.za/size-benefits-info/?v=e4dd286dc7d7](https://dermarolleronlinestore.co.za/size-benefits-info/?v=e4dd286dc7d7)\n\nThe above frequencies are similar to those by Koi-Beauty where I buy my **dermarollers**.

A significant increase in level of **collagen** type I, III, and VII, newly synthesized **collagen** and tropoelastin from baseline was observed after 6 **microneedling** sessions at 2-week intervals. This percutaneous **collagen** induction leads to an overall youthful appearance of the skin by reducing fine lines and wrinkles, reducing pore size, more suppleness, and elasticity.\n\nThe needles also breakdown the old hardened scar strands and allow it to revascularize. Neovascularization and neo**collagen**esis is initiated by migration and proliferation of fibroblasts and laying down of intercellular matrix. A fibronectin matrix forms after 5 days of injury that determines the deposition of **collagen** resulting in skin tightening persisting for 5–7 years in the form of **collagen** III. The depth of neo**collagen**esis has been found to be 5–600 µm \\[.5–.6 mm\\] with a **1.5 mm** length needle. Histological examination of the skin treated with 4 **microneedling** sessions 1 month apart shows upto 400% increase in **collagen** and elastin deposition at 6 months postoperatively, with a thickened stratum spinosum and normal rete ridges at 1 year postoperatively. **Collagen** fibre bundles appear to have a normal lattice pattern rather than parallel bundles as in scar tissue.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4976400/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4976400/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Low-Level Laser Therapy [LLLT]\n\n2013: **LLLT** was discovered serendipitously in the 1960s when mice irradiated with a low fluence red laser grew **hair**. Animal and human data have slowly accumulated supporting **LLLT** for **hair** growth. **LLLT** appears to improve a variety of non-scarring alopecias—AGA \\[Androgenetic Alopecia\\], AA \\[Alopecia Areata\\], and chemotherapy-induced alopecia. Based on the studies demonstrating **LLLT**'s effects on promoting graft survival, it may be further suggested to have a potential to be used during the immediate period of post-**hair** transplant surgery to facilitate the healing process and enhance viability and earlier growth of the grafts. While mechanisms are still emerging, **LLLT** may increase **anagen hairs** through release of NO \\[Nitric Oxide\\] from CCO \\[cytochrome c oxidase\\] by photodissociation and **LLLT** may reduce inflammation in AA. Most studies investigating effects of **LLLT** on **hair** growth have used wavelengths that range from **635 nm** to **650 nm**, but as of today no study has compared the effect of near-infrared wavelengths such as **810 nm**, which have deeper penetrating capacities, to red light.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3944668/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3944668/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2013: **LLLT** aids skin rejuvenation through increasing **collagen** production and decreasing **collagen** degradation. LED which is a novel light source for non-thermal, non-ablative skin rejuvenation has been shown to be effective for improving wrinkles and skin laxity. It is not a new phenomenon since the first reports of **LLLT** effects on increased **collagen** go back to 1987. Studies by Abergel et al. and Yu et al. reported an increase in production of pro-**collagen**, **collagen**, basic fibroblast **growth factors** (bFGF) and proliferation of fibroblasts after exposure to low-energy laser irradiation in vitro and in vivo animal models. Furthermore, **LLLT** was already known to increase microcirculation, vascular perfusion in the skin, alter platelet-derived **growth factor** (PDGF), transforming **growth factor** (TGF-β1) and inhibit apoptosis.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4126803/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4126803/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LLLT Use**\n\nMy LLLT wand/stick is to be used once every two days.

Treatment of such photodamaged skin with all-trans **retinoic acid** increases type I pro**collagen** expression. The mechanism of this increase is not known, however, it may involve increased expression or activation of TGF-β. In addition, treatment of skin with all-trans **retinoic acid** before UV exposure inhibits **collagen** breakdown by matrix metalloproteinases and protects against UV-induced reduction of pro**collagen** expression, as demonstrated in this study. Therefore, all-trans **retinoic acid** and its metabolic precursor all-trans **retinol** (**vitamin A**) should have the capacity to both repair existing photodamage and retard accumulation of new photodamage.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC381286/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC381286/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tretinoin Prescription**\n\nTo get **tretinoin** you need to have a doctor’s prescription–in USA. A way to do this is to say that it is for Actinic Keratosis.\n\n2011: Actinic keratosis is the third most common skin complaint treated by dermatologists in the US and, according to the American Academy of Dermatology, 60% of predisposed individuals over the age of 40 years have at least one lesion. They occur most frequently on sun-exposed skin of the face, scalp, arms, and hands. Important risk factors include fair skin, cumulative sun exposure, and immunosuppression, including further ultraviolet light exposure. Actinic keratosis is now considered to be the beginning of a biologic continuum that leads to invasive squamous cell carcinoma, thus treatment is medically necessary.\n\nSource:[ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3132090/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3132090/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nActinic keratoses describes lesions caused by too much exposure to the ultraviolet rays of sunlight. They are the beginnings of skin cancer, most often appearing after age 40. In some areas where climate is mild year-round, these lesions appear in much younger people. People with fair skin, blond or red hair, and blue or green eyes are most at risk of developing these rough, scaly patches, or keratoses.\n\nSource: [https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-actinic-keratosis-basics](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-actinic-keratosis-basics)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tretinoin Use**\n\nI am supposed to use my **tretinoin** every evening–so I assume all are to be used daily–but the study used **.01%**, I was given **.1%**. The skin cell cycle is 28 days, if I don't use my **tretinoin** for even half that, 2 days after the first application I am peeling all over; it looks terrible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Retinoids**\n\nTopical **retinoids** are still considered the gold standard for clinically effective topical antiaging products . **Retinoids** are a family of compounds composed of **vitamin A**, its derivatives, and synthetic molecules acting through the same pathway. Besides all-trans **retinoic acid** (**RA**), the major bioactive form, the term “**retinoids**” includes retinaldehyde, retinol, and various retinyl esters. They act through **retinoic acid** receptors (RARs) and **retinoid** X receptors (RXRs), increasing the amount of type I procollagens and decreasing the amount of MMPs. **RA** increases the amount of type I, III, and VII **collagens** in the **dermis**, and can reorganize the dermal **collagen** into new woven bundles. In addition, **RA** stimulates normalization of the elastic tissue organization and GAG deposition in the **dermis**. In clinical trials, topical **retinoids** are clinically effective for the treatment of dermal aging, including wrinkles, roughness, and laxity. However, they can be irritating to a significant percentage of the population, and further development of ways to reduce their irritation potential is needed. Retinol, which metabolizes to retinaldehyde and **retinoic acid**, has been found to be less irritating than **retinoic acid** and is widely used as an ingredient for antiaging cosmeceuticals.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6540032/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6540032/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Vitamin C\n\nNote: **Vitamin C**’s purest form is  **L-ascorbic acid**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2017: The following information is available as a result of research into the role of **vitamin C** in skin health:\n\n* Skin fibroblasts have an absolute dependence on **vitamin C** for the synthesis of **collagen**, and for the regulation of the **collagen**/elastin balance in the dermis. There is ample in vitro data with cultured cells demonstrating this dependency. In addition, **vitamin C** supplementation of animals has shown improved **collagen** synthesis in vivo.\n* Skin keratinocytes have the capacity to accumulate high concentrations of **vitamin C**, and this in association with vitamin E affords protection against UV irradiation. This information is available from in vitro studies with cultured cells, with supportive information from animal and human studies.\n* Analysis of keratinocytes in culture has shown that **vitamin C** influences gene expression of antioxidant enzymes, the organisation and accumulation of phospholipids, and promotes the formation of the stratum corneum \\[most outward layer of skin\\] and the differentiation of the epithelium in general.\n* Signs of aging in human skin can be ameliorated through the provision of **vitamin C**. A number of studies support this, although measurement of skin changes is difficult. Some studies include objective measures of **collagen** deposition and wrinkle depth.\n* The provision of **vitamin C** to the skin greatly assists wound healing and minimises raised scar formation. This has been demonstrated in numerous clinical studies in humans and animals.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2012: **L-ascorbic acid** can be used orally and topically for skin benefits. **Vitamin C** is a cofactor for lysyl and prolyl hydroxylase, which stabilize the triple helical structure of **collagen**. It also plays a role in cholesterol synthesis, iron absorption and increases the bioavailability of selenium. The most commonly described cutaneous manifestations accompanying **vitamin C** deficiency are attributed to the impaired **collagen** synthesis.\n\nFurthermore, oral administration of an antioxidant mixture containing **vitamin C**, vitamin E, pycnogenol and evening primrose oil significantly inhibited wrinkle formation caused by chronic UVB irradiation through significant inhibition of UVB-induced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity accompanied by enhancement of **collagen** synthesis on hairless mouse skin.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583891/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583891/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Vitamin C Use**\n\n2001: L-ascorbic acid must be formulated at pH levels less than 3.5 to enter the skin. Maximal concentration for optimal percutaneous absorption was 20%. Tissue levels were saturated after three daily applications; the half-life of tissue disappearance was about 4 days. Derivatives of ascorbic acid including magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, ascorbyl-6-palmitate, and dehydroascorbic acid did not increase skin levels of L-ascorbic acid.\n\nSource: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11207686/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11207686/)\n\nThe above says that **vitamin C**’s low pH may irritate your skin. So only use it a few days before a **dermarolling** session, it only takes 3 daily applications of 20% **vitamin C** to saturate the skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Hyaluronic Acid [HA]\n\nNotes: **HA** can be bought as a lotion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFindings \\[from 1999\\] indicated that suppression of transcriptional activity of type VI **collagen** is associated with the reduction of cartilage matrix tissue, and that **HA** is associated with the suppression of the effect of IL-1β.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6603175/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6603175/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat sentence is hard to understand. It says that **HA** suppresses the effect of IL-1β, which is good because IL-1β suppresses transcriptional activity of type VI **collagen**, which in effect reduces the cartilage matrix tissue.\n\n2011: A major component of the extracellular matrix is \\[**HA**\\] or **hyaluronan**. **HA** is a naturally occurring anionic **polysaccharide** most abundantly present in mammalian skin where it is localized not only in the **dermis** (≈0.5mg/g wet tissue), but also in the **epidermis** (≈0.1mg/g wet tissue). Due to its considerable capacity to bind water, **HA has greater skin hydration properties than other** **polysaccharides**. Topical application of **HA** increases hydration of the \\[stratum corneum⁠—most outward layer of skin\\] largely through a humectant effect.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3050617/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3050617/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2018: \\[**HA**\\] is a naturally occurring biopolymer in bacteria and vertebras. **HA** is a highly hydrophilic molecule with the ability to bind water up to a 1000 times its own weight.\n\nThe turnover rate of **HA** in vivo depends on where the **HA** is located. The half time of **HA** in the circulation system is approximaty 2-5 minutes while the half time in more rigid tissue, such as cartilage, is 1-3 weeks. Almost half of all **HA** is located in the skin, where the half time of **HA** in the **epidermis** layer is 1-2 days.\n\nSource:[ https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1303721/FULLTEXT01.pdf](https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1303721/FULLTEXT01.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2017: Several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown the beneficial actions of **HA** treatment, with anti-inflammatory, wound healing, chondroprotective, antiangiogenic, anti-ageing and immunosuppressive effects, among others.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6403654/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6403654/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2014: The wound healing process can be organized into three main events, and each event involves **HA**:\n\n* (1) a matrix rich in **HA** is laid down in a cell-poor space,\n* (2) mesenchymal cell migration is stimulated and the **HA** matrix is infiltrated by cells migrating from the adjacent tissues, and\n* (3) cells within the **HA** matrix secrete both hyaluronidase, which degrades the **HA**, and sulfated GAGs \\[glycosaminoglycan\\] and **collagen**, which \\[simultaneously\\] replaces the **HA** and the matrix is remodeled.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6603175/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6603175/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAggrecan, biglycan, fibronectin, and **HA** significantly stimulated cell proliferation in DP \\[dermal papilla\\] cell monolayer culture without any effect on DP \\[dermal papilla\\] cell identity.

Testosterone converts to **DHT**. A **DHT** blocker inhibits the conversion of testosterone to **DHT**. As such, **DHT** blockers are bad for **beard** **hair.** Topical **DHT** blockers are not nearly as potent as oral (prescription) blockers and pose less risk of some **beard hair** thinning.

    "body": "Our little dude made his entrance fast and furious last night at 39 weeks + 4 days, 6lbs 11oz.\n\nI had a sweep at 39 weeks and have been doing weekly acupuncture, eating dates, evening primrose oil and raspberry leaf tea for weeks and was hopeful I would go as close to my EDD as possible.\n\nOn July 31st my partner said off handedly \"tomorrow is the day\" and sure enough I woke up yesterday with timeable 10-12 minute apart contractions at 4:30am for about an hour. My partner went to work and I decided to just get on with the day. I took the dog for a walk, had a smoothie and carb loaded some food in me, and then the contractions went away. At about noon they started rolling in again so I got in the bath and worked on breathing through when they came. At this point I was still able to walk/talk through them. At 3:00pm I called the doula and mentioned that things were starting to pick up a bit and that I thought I might call my partner soon to come home. At 4:00pm I texted him and said \"hey, no rush, but I think you should get home soon, things are starting to feel like they're happening\". At the same time I called the doula back and asked her to start heading my direction - 45 minutes outside of town. By the time she showed up at 6:00 I was feeling a lot of pressure in my butt and felt like I needed to get the drive to the city over with, knowing this was going to be a big hurdle for me. She attached the TENS machine (which I actually ended up disliking \\~ probably because I was already so close to transition) and felt like it was just triggering the contractions more than anything.\n\nThe drive was probably the most impossible part. I kneeled in the back with my face over the back seat and just held on for dear life. The intensity of the contractions and the pressure in my lower body was unfathomable and every bump/movement felt like it would shatter me. By the time we got to the hospital I could barely walk, but I also knew I couldn't sit. They let me go straight to a room on L&D instead of registering and as I got into the room I had bloody show and my water broke immediately after. I was checked for dialation and effacement and hooked up to NST and was 7cm dialated and 80% effaced already.\n\nMy doula and partner got me into the shower where I laboured through transition on the toilet. I used some of the gas to take the edge off and the water on my lower back literally felt like heaven on earth. I started bearing down spontaneously and they helped me move back to the bed to make sure it was actually time. I was kneeling on the floor at first and they wanted me to move up but I didn't feel like I could. After a few contractions on the floor I was able to climb into the bed on my hands and knees where 3 minutes of pushing later and Wes was here, less than 2 hrs after I showed up at the hospital doors. My body literally just took over and did what it was doing, I was not in control at all. The most animalistic and intuitive thing I think I've ever done.\n\nI had a few minor 1st degree tears internally and other than that am feeling great. We were discharged 3 hrs after birth and able to sleep last night in our own bed and are now just enjoying a quiet morning at home learning the ropes.\n\nI can't believe I did it.\n\nA note on going unmedicated/without epidural \\~ my plan was always to try to go natural, I'd mentally prepped to do it that way. On the car ride, I strongly felt like I wasn't going to be able to do it. The gas actually ended up working really well for me, but honestly by the time I got there, we just wouldn't have had time to do anything else (I didn't register, I didn't get an IV, I didn't have any admitting blood work etc).\n\nAt the end of the day I went into it with a quote in mind from \"downtobirthshow\" - The goal isn't a home birth, or an unmedicated birth, or even a vaginal birth. The goal is a birth where you feel safe, where you feel heard, and respected, where you feel dignified. The goal is a birth you are peace with.\n\nI hope you all are able to have a birth that brings you peace \\~ whatever that ends up looking like <3",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

And I have not felt this amazing in years. \n\nI am going through a separation of 19 years - two months ago this would have been my absolute final reason because no WAY would I have made it through luteal on top of everything else. It would have been the end. \n\nDespite the separation and stress in my life currently - I haven’t THIS felt mentally clear, happy, pain free and less likely to top myself in what feels like forever. (Nothing to do with the separation lol we are the best of friends) \n\nAnd the only difference is taking Magnesium, Hemp seed oil, evening primrose oil and the combined pill, no sugar pill. \n\nFor anyone worried about not having periods - I was informed there is zero reason for it because your body is put in a different cycle. And honestly even if it WAS better to enforce periods - I’d take synthetic hormones ANY day to never ever ever go through luteal EVER again \n\nI hope this can help anyone at all xx",

    "body": "Sharing my post here as well. Recently, I had posted requesting dupes for Bite's Agave Lip Mask as it is now being discontinued. This stuff is ride or die lip salvation for me. I live somewhere super dry, work in a dry environment, take meds that dry me out, you get the picture. I'm a moisture junkie. I gathered the piece that works is the lanolin in it so I tried some similar products and wrote some reviews of them.\n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/kV6xjSG) are the products I've tried. Not pictured is the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, which I emptied and tossed the container.  From left to right I have the Bite lip mask, Lanolips Lanostick, Lanolips 101 ointment, Glossier Balm Dotcom in 3 flavors (original, birthday cake, and rose), Go-To Lips, Jack Black, Aquaphor, and Vaseline.\n\n**Bite Agave Lip Mask** 10/10\n\n    Ingredients: Trans-Resveratrol, Lanolin (Pharma Grade), Organic Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Organic Butyrospermum, Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Rosinate, Organic Agave Tequilana (Blue Agave) Nectar, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil Unsaponifiables, Organic Cera Alba (Beeswax), Flavor, Vanillin, Siraitia Grosvernori (Monk Fruit), Vanilla Tahitensis (Vanilla) Fruit Extract, Organic Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Trans-resveratrol, Vitis Vinefera (Grape) Oil, Tocopherol Acetate, Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, and Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, +/- May Contain: Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Carmine (CI 75470).\n\nI think what has done it for me with this one is the occlusive elements as well as moisturizers. I can see it has oils and lanolin plus beeswax. I like the thick texture which is almost sticky as well as the tube packaging. I personally like the absence of SPF as when I am really chapped those can sting/burn my lips. I also really like the smell/taste of the original. The small tube lasts a long time and it saves me a lot of discomfort in the dry winters, especially working in a hospital with all the recycled air. \n\n**Lanolips Lanostick** 8/10\n\n    Lanolin*, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil*, capryloyl glycerin/sebacic acid copolymer*, cera alba (beeswax)*, caprylic/capric triglyceride*, persea gratissima (avocado) oil*, jojoba esters (simmondsia chinensis)*, aroma (nat flavour)*, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter*, euphorbia cerifera (candelilla) cera*, magnifera indica (mango) seed butter*, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil*, copernicia cerifera (carnauba) cera*, tocopherol (vit E)* *100% natural/naturel\n    \nI feel like this one on the lips is very similar in feel to the Bite. It is probably my favorite of the dupes that I've tried. It has a lot of similar ingredients such as the lanolin, castor oil, beeswax, shea butter, and some other oils. It has a different flavor/scent than the Bite mask. It is almost citrus in nature? I think I can see myself using this one once I go through my stash of Bite (thanks to the redditor who messaged me saying Sephora kept restocking, I was able to snag some). My complaint? The fact it is a stick and not a tube! I haven't lost the cap of this in my pocket yet but that happens to me with regular sticks. I also worry the stick will break because it gets too soft from being stored in my pocket. All in all the best dupe so far.  It also got me through days at the hospital without wanting to rip my lips off my face so win.\n\n**Lanolips 101 Ointment** 7/10\n\n    Ingredients: Lanolin, lanolin oil. *naturally derived/*Dérivé naturellement.\n\nI got this one because I was already ordering from Ulta and was able to use a coupon and my points, I imagine it is basically the same as the nipple creams and other straight up lanolin out there. It is good. Tube is nice. Cap doesn't stay on super great. No color or flavor so I can use it for my cuticles and other dry patches. I can't complain but I'm not gonna sing out from the rooftops or anything like that. You can get lanolin only products much cheaper for much more product elsewhere. It does do its job locking in moisture though.\n\n**Glossier Balm Dotcom** 8/10\n\n    Ingredients: Petrolatum, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Beeswax/Cera Alba/Cire d’Abeille, Lanolin, Theobroma Grandiflorum Seed Butter, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, BHT, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol.\n\nI know I originally wanted to avoid petroleum based products but I did have a sample of it that I liked well enough so I got the 3 pack on Glossier's site to try the other flavors. Original seems to be more sticky than the other flavors and feels more like the Bite mask. It does a good enough job, the flavors are fun. I like the tube packaging. The rose is so much better than the perfume co. rose balm which is rose flavored vaseline. I feel like it did a good job moisturizing and lasting to lock in the moisture while I was at work too.\n\n**Go-to Lips** 4/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tUltra Medical Grade Lanolin, Shea Butter, Apricot Kernel Oil, Beeswax, Sweet Almond Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Vitamin E, Fragrance (Pure Pomegranate), Pomegranate Seed Oil, Calendula Oil, Jojoba Oil, Avocado Oil.\n\nI think I might be rating this lower because I had higher expectations for it. The ingredients sound great. Its in a nice tube. But its so slippery, it feels like a lip oil on the lips instead of a balm or sticky mask. It has a strong scent/flavor but it isn't unpleasant. Its so messy out of the tube though because it is so slick! I wasn't looking for an oil so I'm a little bummed. I can't say it doesn't moisturize my lips though but it doesn't have the staying power to make use of the occlusives in it. \n\n**Jack Black Lip Balm** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tBeeswax, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, C 18-38 Alkyl Hydroxystearol Stearate, Camellia Sinenesis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Flavor, Lanolin, Microcrystalline Wax, Ozokerite, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Polyglyceryl 3 Beeswax, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\nPretty middle of the road chapstick. Theres some beeswax, some lanolin, some shea butter. It has SPF though which is a negative for me for a day to day balm. I guess there isn't a lot wrong with it, it doesn't dry me out but if I am dry it stings. Its a little slicker than Bite too. I got it awhile ago as a sample and it just didn't wow me but it is a popular item.\n\n**Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy** 5/10\n\n    Active ingredient: Petrolatum (41%) – Skin protectant Inactive ingredients: Mineral Oil, Ceresin, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenol, Glycerin, Bisabolol\n\nI use this at work when I leave chapstick at home because we have samples of it everywhere. It's good for prevention of radiation dermatitis if you're into that sort of thing. It has no flavor, no taste. Its slippery and greasy feeling due to the high petroleum content. It's a solid product in general just not for my dream chapstick replacement. Good stuff though. Will continue to have on hand.\n\n**Vaseline Lip Therapy Advanced Healing** 2/10\n\n    Active ingredient: White Petroleum, USP 100%. Inactive ingredient: Flavor.\n\nLiterally marked up vaseline. What makes it more advanced than regular Vaseline?? Doesn't do much for me but vaseline never did. I bought it from the pharmacy at work when I left my chapstick at home. I do like the tube so I guess it isn't pointless. \n\n**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tDiisostearyl Malate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytosteryl / Isostearyl / Cetyl / Stearyl / Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax / Cera Microcristallina / Cire Microcristalline, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Synthetic Wax, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax / Candelilla Cera / Cire de Candelilla, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Butylene / Ethylene / Styrene Copolymer, Ethylene / Propylene / Styrene Copolymer, Mica (CI 77019), Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Dimethicone, Fragrance / Parfum, Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Methicone, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax / Cera Carnauba / Cire de Carnauba, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Yellow 6 Lake (CI 15985), Red 6 (CI 15850), Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Water, Potassium Alginate, Propanediol, Glycerin, Alcohol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Sapindus Mukorossi Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Chamaemorus Seed Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Chenopodium Quinoa Seed Extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Beta-Glucan, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Ascorbyl Glucoside.\n\nOk at the risk of sounding crunchy granola AF what the hell is some of the stuff in this? Why does there need to be a million things in this? Theres some shea butter, some synthetic wax, other wax, silicones, and other stuff in it. No lanolin or petroleum. If you're allergic to lanolin its probably good. It's not bad. It's a little too slippery for my likes in a lip product. It doesn't stay on a long time. It doesn't seem to moisturize better than any other product. It doesn't seem to hurt my lips. I don't like the little tub it comes in because I don't want to wash my hands every time I wanna put lip balm on. It costs a little much for what it is for me. \n\n\n**Closing Arguments** *TL;DR*\n\nWhile Bite may be my ride or die, it's going the way of the dinosaur. Lanolips has good products, the lanostick might be the most similar in terms of ingredients/feel although the packaging is different. Glossier's balm is suitable too although it does have petroleum in it. Most of these products do have lanolin and/or beeswax in them so they aren't suitable for vegans. \n\nI'd love to hear if there are any I missed trying, despite having tons of chapstick I am a chapstick junkie so I'd be interested to hear!",

        "body": "First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair lip balm is my HG for dry lips. It’s a very thick, almost sticky, balm-mask. I usually have to warm a little of the product on my finger before applying it because it is so thick. It has a very slightly minty scent and a slight cooling sensation on application. It comes in a small tin, and one tin lasts me approximately a year of twice daily use. I also work in a hospital environment, and this is the only balm that has ever adequately protected my lips from the dry hospital air. It’s also currently $10 (half off) on their website. Thanks to you, I looked it up so I could post the ingredients and saw the sale so I’ll probably stock up on a little more!\n\n\nThe ingredients are: Cera Alba (Beeswax, Cire d'abeille), Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Water/Aqua/Eau, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Lecithin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Glycerin, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Colloidal Oatmeal, Dimethicone, Aroma (Flavor), Urea, Mel (Honey, Miel), Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Propolis Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Vanilla Planifolia Fruit Extract, Butylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hydroxide, EDTA, Eugenol.",

It doesn’t make sense to me and I wonder if I’ll eventually feel menopause or if I’ll just slowly change. I also suspect it could be the heball teas and supplements I took for my awful periods helped me (sage tea, evening primrose oil, flax). My mother went through hell in menopause so it’s really weird.

I ended snagging a fragrance and a face oil and they are LOVELY. If you're a fan of the general smell of the southwest and sustainable businesses,  I highly recommend checking this shop out!\n\n\n**Desert Rain herbal fragrance** - *A perfect blend of the creosote (chapparal) bush, sage, and sweet sandalwood*\nThis is STRONG and absolutely magical. If you've never been to the desert after rain, it has a very distinct smell due to creosote and this captures that so wonderfully. It smells slightly dank in a pleasant way, fresh, and alive. I actually use it as a room spray more often than a perfume because it's super potent and I could see it being overpowering to have on you at first. \n\n**Desert Primrose face oil** - *wildcrafted creosote, organic evening primrose oil and organic rosehip oil*\nThis is somewhat similar to the fragrance due to creosote, but this one feels more..wet and humid to me. It truly evokes that amazing \"just had a monsoon storm\" feeling. I put it on my face before bed sometimes and it soothes me. \n\n\n\nI did end up getting the prickly pear concentrate as well and made some amazing margaritas with it lol. The shop offers a variety of product and I've been wanting to try more for a while. If you're someone who loves desert smells that feel exceptionally genuine and not \"prettied\" up in anyway, it's well worth a visit :)\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/SonoranRosie",

    "body": "This is just information not suggestions. If you are really having a hard time with medication I'm so sympathetic. It took me a year to work out how to use vyvanse effectively.\n\nEveryone is very unique and this is just something to read  though if you're feeling stuck, confused or like you don't know what is going on with your vyvanse.\n\nSometimes stimulant medication can be a little bit helpful or super helpful depending on other things you do to optimise it.\n\nThe brain needs water, amino acids and other nutrients to use medication effectively.\n\nIf you take vyvanse but don't eat a solid meal with protein and slow release carbs when you take it, and drink water then it has nothing to make dopamine with and you may just get side effects without the benefit.\n\nSlow release carbs are important because your brain needs carbs for energy but when blood sugar drops it can make you feel jittery, anxious and unable to concentrate. Slow release carbs are low GI\n\nList of them here: [https://baker.edu.au/-/media/documents/fact-sheets/baker-institute-factsheet-carbohydrates-and-glycaemic-index.pdf](https://baker.edu.au/-/media/documents/fact-sheets/baker-institute-factsheet-carbohydrates-and-glycaemic-index.pdf)\n\nDopamine is made of tyrosine. You can take an L-tyrosine supplement half an hour before eating in the morning. It can help ease the crash when stimulants wear off.\n\nIf your urine is acidic you will probably excrete vyvanse faster. This is a complicated thing to work out but if you are finding the medication wears off too quickly try taking Ural to alkalinise your urine. (A sachet thing people take when the have UTI.)\n\nCaffeine can be good or bad. Experiment with having it with your medication. Too much might make you feel jittery and anxious. Green or black tea is good I think because it is hydrating, you get some caffeine and also antioxidants.\n\nTake magnesium, B6 and zinc (many people with ADHD are low in zinc) to help your brain make neurotransmitters and use them effectively.\n\nMake sure your iron is normal. Low iron worsens ADHD symptoms.\n\nInflammation especially neuroinflammation will make you use up dopamine and other neurotransmitters faster. If your vyvanse isn't working, try taking fish oil, tumeric and ibuprofen for a few days and see if reducing inflammation makes it more effective.\n\nIf you are in a female body and have a menstrual cycle, you may find vyvanse is wayy less effective in your luteal phase (2 weeks before period). This is because oestrogen is a bit anti-inflammatory and also very calming for the brain, helps it focus. Try taking 1g/day gamma linolenic acid from evening primrose oil or borage oil. Also take B6 and fish oil to reduce inflammation.\n\nSleep is really important and really hard with ADHD. Some options that can be useful are GABA, Mg glycinate, vitamin C, L-theanine, inositol, low dose melatonin, CBD oil or medicinal cannabis if that is a option where you are.\n\nExercise is very good for ADHD brains. Studies have shown that in kids with ADHD 30 mins of exercise was as useful as ritalin for focussing in the morning in class. Exercise is very individual and sometimes you need to experiment with lots of things to find one you like. The main thing is that moving your body in any way releases endorphins and helps your brain to feel calmer and focus better. It also helps with sleep for many people.\n\nThis is long, but I want people to feel empowered and like they can try lots of things to feel good. ADHD brains are wonderful sometimes and I want people to be able to enjoy them if possible.\n\nMaybe vyvanse isn't the right medication for you. Other options are the methylphenidate meds, strattera, bupropion, guanfacine/clonidine, CBD oil, nutritional supplements or high intensity exercise and being outdoors a lot.\n\nSelf-compassion, empowerment and feeling understood are very good for people with ADHD. Hard to get but worth working on getting them.",

    "body": "I was first diagnosed with non-erosive gastritis at age 20. Initially, the burning wasn’t constant. It would come and go from ages 20-23. For years, I dealt with the burning and would try my best to ignore it, but you can’t ignore your body crying out for help forever. I would say ages 24-25 were the years I found the burning to be the worst. Omeprazole was a hit or miss for me. I would have really good days when it worked and bad days when it didn’t work. I also hated taking the medication, and after researching the long-term use of Omeprazole, I became even more against the medication. It was when I turned 25 (thank God for that frontal lobe development!) that I decided enough was enough, and I was going to heal my stomach. And that’s exactly what I did. \n\nI’ll be 100% honest: I didn’t completely follow the diet recommendations I’ve seen on Reddit, but I tried my very best to reduce sugar, tomatoes, alcohol, etc. However, I wouldn’t say my diet was a completely new one. I didn’t become vegan or vegetarian, and I don’t fast, as I’m already quite slim, so intermittent fasting wouldn’t be helpful for my small weight. \n\nI had an endoscopy performed at age 26, and there was no redness/inflammation found in my stomach. They also took a biopsy from my stomach and didn’t find anything abnormal. \n\nWhat caused my gastritis in the first place: **Ibuprofen**\n\nI suffered from awful period pains on the first day of my cycle, so to get rid of the pain, I would use Ibuprofen all the time. I did this constantly from about age 18 to 21. Yes, even after being diagnosed with gastritis, I was still taking Ibuprofen. But now I don’t use Ibuprofen whatsoever. I use magnesium gel from BetterYou on my stomach to relieve cramps, drink raspberry tea and take evening primrose oil, and use heat patches for my cramps - all natural/herbal remedies. \n\nHere are all the things I used to reduce the burning in my stomach: \n\n1. Zinc Carnosine - this brand worked best for me: [https://www.gosupps.com/zinc-carnosine-supplement-84mg-per-capsule-150-count-non-gmo-gluten-free-by-horbaach.html](https://www.gosupps.com/zinc-carnosine-supplement-84mg-per-capsule-150-count-non-gmo-gluten-free-by-horbaach.html) \\- I would take two in the morning every day, and it would reduce my burning significantly, almost to the point that the burning would be non-existent. At one point, I was able to get off Omeprazole (My dose was 20mg x 2 - in the morning and in the night - so 80mg in total for each day) and stay off it for seven months until I could feel the burning coming back again. Even while on Omeprazole, I would take zinc carnosine, too. Be careful if you consume a lot of seafood because zinc poisoning is a thing! \n2. Chamomile Tea—this brand worked for me: [https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0CX218Q6Y/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_search\\_asin\\_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0CX218Q6Y/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). It helps reduce the burning, but I still had burning when drinking this; it just helped relieve the burning, so it wasn’t as painful. \n3. Manuka Honey - [https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07DZSMJYF/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_search\\_asin\\_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07DZSMJYF/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) \\- when my throat used to burn, this helped relieve the burning in my throat - I would take one tablespoon of it every morning\n\n\n\nThis is what **HEALED** my gastritis, I’m certain: *Raw cabbage juice*\n\nDr. Eric Berg has a video on YouTube about gastritis—[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9SlvZ2wqUI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9SlvZ2wqUI)—and he mentions cabbage juice, so I began drinking a glass of raw cabbage juice every morning and night. My burning went away after two weeks. I also began taking cabbage and broccoli juice (so I added raw broccoli to the blender). \n\nAll you have to do is put chopped washed cabbage in a blender with water and store it in the fridge. Drink a glass of it every morning and night consistently for two weeks. Even if you still have burning and you still need to take Omeprazole or whatever medication you take for the pain, KEEP DRINKING cabbage juice for your stomach lining. Even with my gastritis gone, I still drink cabbage juice regularly to maintain my healthy stomach lining.  \n\nWhat I would recommend in terms of diet:\n\n1. Reduce/remove the amount of tomato in your diet—I’m Nigerian, so this was really hard, as the majority of our dishes are tomato-based. I love jollof rice, but I also love my stomach more, so I had to stop eating it for a while. I can eat it just fine now, though, so giving it up for a while was worth it!\n2. Reduce alcohol intake - alcohol didn’t cause my gastritis, but it didn’t help the burning, so I had to reduce my intake of it. Luckily, I’m a social drinker, so I don’t rely on alcohol to improve my mood or need to have it with meals. I only like drinking when I’m out with friends, mostly in the summer when everyone’s outside (I'm a UK girlie so best believe, everyone's outside when it's hot). However, this year, I’m taking the plunge and doing the entire year (especially summer) sober. Wish me luck!\n3. Get rid of junk food! All that stuff is terrible for you and honestly makes the burning worse. If you find that you can’t live without junk food (I admit, I love me some pizza sometimes), limit it to once a month or once a quarter. The longer you go without it, the more you realise you don’t need it. Get healthy snacks - seaweed sheets, seaweed crisps, lentil chips, nuts, etc. \n4. Reduce sugar intake—I’m still working on this as I get older, but sugar, especially artificial sugar, is bad for us! \n5. Add more greens to your diet. I love spinach, so it became my best friend once I decided I was going to get rid of my gastritis for good. But lettuce, kale, and broccoli, brussels sprouts all work, too. Try to consume them daily with as many meals as you can. \n\nI wish everyone who is trying to heal their stomach all the best. You can do this; just believe in yourself and don’t give up. Healing is both a physical and mental journey, so you need to BELIEVE that your gastritis will go. I just wanted to share what worked for me because Reddit was the main place I went to when I was trying to find solutions to my problem, and I’m glad to say that I no longer have gastritis. \n\n",

After a month on 60mg( 40am, 20pm)  ( had reduced from 80mg for past 10months), I've reduced now to only 40mg AM and doing Pepcid 20mg PM. After about 35hrs I had lot burning in my esophagus, stomach, and tongue. I had a whitish layer on my tongue. I did 2times oil pulling with coconut oil and it subsided, not fully gone. The stomach and esophagus burning also reduced to some extent. \n    Got the NZ Co Manuka Honey, tasted it and it was so mediciny...that i felt scared to try. It's been almost 10days since I got it but I have not eaten it yet. I have sibo and ibs too. I am worried if it'll increase my bloating from the sugar? I don't tolerate sugar too well. I also read online that manuka honey is potent enough to kill bacteria and destroy biofilms. If that happens, it'll cause die-off. And die off symptoms 😭.... I really want to rid myself of this gastritis and reflux but I am so scared to help myself. \n      Same story with trying cabbage juice. Cabbage is high fodmap, and I am scared it'll cause extreme bloating which flares everything for me -- gastritis, sibo, and endo. \n            I am nervous and excited at the same time that I am now on 40mg ppi + 20mg Pepcid,  finally; after 11 horrible months.

That was around the time I discovered this sub and realised that maybe that wasn’t normal. \n\nThe second experiment happened when I was taken off the SSRIs for a while. In case you’re wondering, yes they had definitely been the reason for the reduction in symptoms. It got ugly. Won’t be coming off them again. \n\nI read a post in this sub about which supplements have actually been shown to help with PMDD symptoms. To begin with, I just kinda took everything to see if it could make a difference. I’ve been tracking my mood and symptoms and now that I’ve got about 6 months worth of info, I can definitely see patterns. \n\nHopefully this can help someone else wondering about different supplements. \n\nThese make me feel more energised but don’t necessarily help with PMDD symptoms: Vitamin D3 - 25mg, Vit B6 100mg, B1 7mg, B2 14mg, B3 4.5mg, B12 25ug. I take these every day. It took about 3 months for my pee to turn yellow from the daily B vitamins which makes me thing maybe I had a deficiency before. \n\nEvening primrose oil: 1000mg after ovulation until the start of my period. This definitely helps with PMDD symptoms. \n\nMagnesium 266mg and zinc 10mg. I only added this in two months ago. The first month, I had no PMDD symptoms for the first time...since when? I don’t remember. The second month, almost none. \n\nThis month, I decided to experiment and see if the magnesium + zinc worked on its own without the evening primrose oil. I made it to day 20 before I gave in. Everything hurts, I feel awful and hungry and tired. Won’t try that again. This seems to be my winning combination 🤷‍♀️",

    "body": "Okay at the beginning of my AB eoutine, I went crazy with toners and lotions that I used almost everything that were raved about here on Reddit. My skin type is dry and dehydrated and I get hormonal acne on my chin whenever I get my period. These are all Japanese products. I haven't tried any Korean toners/lotions yet but feel free to recommend some to me. \n\n**1. Kikumasamune Lotion**\n\nShort Description: This was my first toner and still a staple in my routine. I know people are turned off by the smell but it kinda smells like bubble gum to me and I love it. It's a milky looking watery toner that is sake-based. \n\nPros: I love that it comes in a huge bottle that takes me a year to finish despite using it on my body and scalp aside from my face. It can get sticky though but it's a nice pre-hydration for my other steps. Used alone, it makes my skin feeling soft and supple.\n\nCons: Downside is the pump, I can't seem to get the hang of it. I've decanted it into a spray bottle to make it easier to put on my face. It has ferments and not good for people with fungal acne.\n\n**2. Sana Nameraka Honpo Lotion**\n\nShort Description: This was an unplanmed buy  because the online seller of AB products in my area didn't have Hada Lobo toner at the time and offered me this to try instead. SANA has lots of products including a facial cream and a face wash, all of which contain Soy Isoflavones. This one is milky much like the Kiku toner. \n\nPros: This is a simple, affordable toner that can be used by beginners of AB routine. It's light and can be used for the 7 skin method. You can even use it as a facial spray to refresh you in the summer.\n\nCons: I didn't notice any differences or changes to my skin so I didn't repurchase. It isn't for people with soy allergies. Also has ethanol if you're sensitive to that.\n\n**3. Naturie Hatomugi Skin Conditioner**\n\nShort Description: Hatomugi is Japanese for Job's Tears, also known as adlay or Chinese Pearl Barley. It's a type of grain-bearing plant and native all over Southeast Asia so Southeast Asian redditors may be familiar with this. Aside from Job's Tears being the star ingredient, it also has Licorice Extract or Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate if you read the ingredients, which is also good for the skin. \n\nWhen I went to Hongkong, this was advertised everywhere that I just had to get a bottle for myself to see what all the hype was about.\n\nPros: It's cool, light and watery. You'd think you're applying water if it weren't for the cloudiness in it. I used this with my compressed sheet masks. It comes in a bottle like the Kiku and is very affordable. For my skin, it helps a lot when I get splotchy red rashes when the weather here gets drier and humid.\n\nCons: contains alcohol and might not be suitable for people sensitive to it. \n\n**4. Hada Labo Gokujyun Hydrating Lotion (Moist)**\n\nShort Description: Even before discovering this subreddit, I have always read about Hada Labo and was disappointed that it wasn't available in my country. This product has a cult following and I'm pretty sure I don't even need to describe it.\n\nPros: I love the thick texture of this toner and a few drops goes a long way. It leaves my skin plump and dewy and I know I can't live without this anymore. It has been one of the best products for my severely dehydrated skin.\n\nCons: I can't find any! Although I've read that some people break out from this because of Butylene Glycol.\n\n**5. Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Lotion**\n\nShort Description: I've always wanted to try thid when I ran out of my OG Hada Labo but it was always sold out from my local online sellers. I had the chance to try it when I went to Japan last year and I regret not buying several bottles. It has five different molecular weights of hyaluronic acid which is probably why it's thicker in consistency. \n\nPros: Hada Labo Moist was my first love but you know how first loves rarely last. So now, Hada Labo Premium is my main bae. It has effectively made my face so plump and smooth that I just can't stop touching my face. I've also recently restarted my tret and this one has kept the flaking at bay.\n\nCons: it can be a bit tacky esp when I use it during humid da\nys. Also, like the HL moist, it has butylene glycol.\n\n**6. Matsuyama Hadauru Moisturizing Infusion Toner**\n\nShort Description: I bought this along with the HL Premium. I didn't even know what it was because there was no English name on the bottle and just dumped it into my cart when i was in Donki. I just opened and tried it a few weeks ago. The toner has 5 types of ceramide, allantoin, different forms of soybean and rice bran. \n\nPros: I looove the ingredients on this one. Ir has combined all the nourishing ingredients in one bottle! It's fragrance-free as well which is a bonus for those with sensitive noses. I stopped using my Kiku and Hada Labo for a while just to test out the effects of this one and it still kept the side effects of my tret at bay. \n\nCons: I can't find it in my local online AB stores. It has soy and may not be suitable for people with sensitivities to it.\n\n**7. Muji Light Toning Water - High Moisture**\n\nShort Description - While I was vacationing in Japan, I ran out of my decanted toners. I didn't want to get a full sized one yet because I was hopping around Japan and didn't want to lug around a heavy luggage. When I went to the 711 near my hostel, I found that they sold small bottles of Muji skincare and got the small bottle of this.\n\nPros: I've always loved Muji but haven't given their skincare products a try. At the time I couldn't read the ingredient list but I soon discovered that this is a perfect toner for those with sensitive skin because it's fragrance-free, doesn't contain alcohol and is paraben free.\n\nCons: It has that slippery feel when applied to skin. After three layers of it on my skin, I feel it's a bit oily and my skin didn't absorb it leaving a film-like residue on my skin.\n\n**8. Kose Sekkisei Lotion**\n\nShort Description: An impulse buy simply because the packaging looks beautiful. It has Job's Tears and Witch Hazel Extract.\n\nCons: I'm going straight to the point and say that I didn't like this at all. It stung my face and smelled strongly of alcohol. I didn't finish the bottle and it ended up being used on my legs since I didn't want to throw away an almost full bottle.\n\n**9. Mebika Moisture Lotion**\n\nShort description: Like Matsuyama has different types of ceramides, rice bran and a whole lot of extra goodness like royal jelly, Job's tears, soybean, licorice extract). It's relatively cheap as well for a big bottle. \n\nPros: I think this could replace Matsuyama in terms of performance on my skin since it both contains different types of ceramides and the effects are good too.\n\nCons: Has evening primrose oil, tocopherol and butylene glycol which may trigger acne in some. \n\n**10. Minon Moist Charge Lotion I and II**\n\nShort Description: Just like its name it has 11 types of amino acids. It claims that 9 of those amino acids are for moisturizing while the remaining 2 are for clarifying. Lotion I is for dehydrated and oily skin while Lotion II is for dry skin. I have used both not knowing the differences beforehand.\n\nPros: It sinks in fast and although light is surprisingly moisturizing. I've tried using this alone in the morning and just topping it off with sunscreen. I could see myself using this during times when I need to hurry for work. \n\nCons: has butylene glycol and tocopherol\n\n**11. Kuramoto Bijin Hakumai Fermentation Lotion**\n\nShort Description: I got this as a plus one after getting the milk which I love. It's produced by a Sake Brewery, Tonoike Shuzouten and the star ingredient is of course Sake.\n\nPros: It's hydrating snd soothing particularly on a hot day. I also love the smell although it can be a con for some. \n\nCons: It has a gel like consistency that somewhat feels tacky and would sometimes sting on my skin. If you're going to buy this, I'd suggest go for the milk instead.\n\nI do have more from my haul during my Japan trip last year but have yet to try it. Will post reviews after I have done some testing on my skin.\n\n \n\n\n",

    "body": "You guys may remember my post last week about a horribly behaved nurse shaming me for my induction. Well, I had a great induction experience and wanted to share for other moms going through GH. It was such a source of comfort to read success stories from other moms like me. \n\nI had been hoping for a drug and intervention free delivery, and basically everything I hadn’t planned on happening did. I’d read all the books : hypnobirthing, Ina May, etc. I found great information in their pages, and I’m glad I read them. However, when it came time to labor, I listened to the most important source: my body.\n\nI entered L&D at 4 p.m. on Thursday, and they started me on my first round of Cytotec. I was already 80% effaced and 1 cm dilated. I don’t know if it has ANY bearing whatsoever, but I ate the dates, drank raspberry tea and took Evening Primrose Oil during my last few weeks. I know from this subreddit that all of those things can be hit or miss, so make of it what you will. Anyway, I had three rounds of Cytotec total overnight and had thinned to 2 cm by the morning. I had light period cramping, but nothing too serious. They started me on Pitocin sometime in the morning, and the contractions started to ramp up. I’d only opened to 3 cm and the contractions were two minutes apart and strong. I started to wonder about an epidural.\n\nI hadn’t been against one per se, but I wanted to try to labor without. I wanted to be able to walk around, get into the tub, etc. I was also scared of a possible spinal headache and didn’t like the thought of being tied to my bed for hours after delivery. Honestly, I’d heard so much about how interventions like epidurals and induction can affect latching, breastfeeding, etc. that I didn’t want to take the chance. But Pitocin contractions are no joke. \n\nI started talking through my concerns about the epidural and my amazing nurses talked to me about my fears. And then I started to rationalize and really think about the situation. Our baby had been difficult to monitor all day and night. Really, the only position where they could get a clear read on her was when I was laying down. So, my plan to move around and get in the tub went out the window. I also knew if my BP went too high, I’d likely have to get an epidural anyway. So, what’s the point in enduring grueling contractions for hours with the same result? There is no reward for suffering. \n\nAfter maybe thirty minutes of bad contractions, I made up my mind and was then HUNGRY for that epidural. 😂 I’ll say my least favorite part of the whole process was the entry of the needle. I just really hated the feeling. But once it was in… hot damn was it sweet. They say it can take 15 minutes or so to take effect, but I felt a difference in my very next contraction. Soon, I was cuddled up with my pillow, napping and enjoying the heck out of myself. If we choose to have more babies, I will forever ask for an epidural. A true miracle of modern medicine. \n\nI sort of lost track of time with the napping, but I reached four centimeters and then eventually six. My doctor doesn’t mess around and would up my Pitocin every 15 minutes. You could see my contractions ramping up like crazy on the monitor, but I couldn’t feel a thing. But then baby’s heart rate started doing funny things. At the peak of my contractions, her heart rate would decelerate. I could hear it on the monitor, and listening to those fast beeps turn slow, made my stomach drop. They figured she was in an awkward position and moved me around to help fix the problem. Her heart rate would go back to normal, but then sure enough, it would dip down again. My nurse didn’t straight out say it, but it was clear we were going to start thinking about a c-section. I started crying worrying about baby’s safety, and my doctor assured me that she was going to be fine, and no matter what we’d get her out. \n\nOut of nowhere I started to feel some pressure, and this tiny almost knock-like sensation at my cervix. I told the nurse and she checked me, only to find that I was ready to push! The doctor came in, confirmed and said we were about to have a baby! It all happened so fast. I pushed for a max of ten minutes, three deep breath pushes at a time with my husband and nurse helping hold my legs. I felt the pressure of her head, but no pain. Shortly before she came out, “I’ll Be Seeing You” by Billie Holiday (whom our little girl now shares a birthday with!) started ringing out from our birthing playlist. And then our baby girl was born and placed right on my chest, where she stayed for the next hour before they did any tests at all. My husband cut the cord once it finished pulsing, and we cried so many happy tears. \n\nShe’s absolutely perfect. Despite my fears of intervention affecting breastfeeding, I’ve been very blessed in the colostrum department, and she has been full and fed from the start. Her mouth is so tiny, so we’re using nipple shields for now. But she’s fulfilled her diaper requirements easily and passed all of her health tests with flying colors. My milk officially came in last night, and she is one happy camper. \n\nI was up and taking a shower two hours after birth. My vagina was sore and the first pee burned, but really I don’t have much I can complain about. I only needed two stitches, and it’s barely noticeable. The first poop was a literal pain, but I found holding a cold cloth up against my vagina while pushing really helped with the pressure and got things moving, Also, take the stool softeners and drink juice. The second poop isn’t nearly as bad.\n\nI’m sore from the epidural site - I’m told that will go away in a couple of days. It feels like a bruise or a pulled muscle. The hospital provided me with all of the postpartum tools I need to heal, so I’m really glad I didn’t spend the money on the ones advertised online. We had also considered hiring a doula, and while I completely understand their value and worth, I was really glad we didn’t. With how quickly things changed, it would have been a lot of money wasted for us, during a really expensive time in our lives! My husband was the only support person I wanted in the room.\n\nIn total, I was in active labor for only four hours and pushed for just 10 minutes. It’s impossible to know if the epidural sped the process up by helping my body relax, or if it would have been a fast labor regardless. But what I do know is that I ultimately listened to what I needed and didn’t let the ideals I’d read about online and in books affect my decision. My nurse told me it broke her heart when moms would say they felt like failures if they got an epidural. There is no failure! Do what is right for your body. \n\nMy blood pressure went back to normal after labor, and then before being discharged 24 hours later, it went back up to the 140 range where it had been during my last few weeks of pregnancy. The nurses said it’s pretty common because your body breathes a huge sigh of relief with the birth, and then kind of recalibrates back to where it was and eventually goes back to normal over time. So, I’m still monitoring at home, as postpartum pre-e is always a possibility. But both baby and I are now home, healthy and happy.\n\nThis very long-winded post is a way to say that just because your birth isn’t exactly what you had planned or dreamed about, doesn’t mean it can’t be wonderful and positive. I’m so grateful my doctor did what was right for me and baby. We’re both here and healthy, soaking up all the cuddles and sleepless nights. I have a newfound respect for my body. The soft tummy and stretch marks remind me of what I’ve accomplished. I grew this incredible little human and then pushed her out in a matter of hours. I’m damn proud of myself. \n\nAlso, shout out to all of the incredible L&D nurses who were a part of our labor. I know from my last post that they can make or break the experience, and we really lucked out with some of the most amazing and supportive women I could have asked for. Thankfully, the guilt-tripper I encountered earlier in the week was nowhere to be found.\n\nInduction isn’t the monster it’s made out to be. Release yourself of the expectations of others and do what is best for you and your baby. Best of luck to all the mamas out there! We are all warriors.",

    "body": "I wanted to understand which brands performed the best in 3rd party testing, so pulled this together for myself. Sharing it with the community in case it's helpful for others.\n\n# Summary Results:\n\n1st (tie). Jarrow, Natures Bounty, NOW, Seeking Health: 100%  \n5th (tie). Nature Made, Swanson: 90%  \n7th. Doctor’s Best: 89%  \n8th. Life Extension: 80%  \n9th. Nature's Way: 78%  \n10th (tie). Nutricost, Sports Research: 75%  \n12th. Solaray: 70%  \n13th. Bulk Supplements: 57%\n\n\n\n# Method and Notes:    \n\n* These are the brands I currently buy, it's not a complete list of brands. I generally go for established, good, but moderately priced brands.\n* I searched for the brand on Consumer Labs and viewed the first 10 product reviews for each (or as many were available if less than 10). I ignored any results that related to tests not done by Consumer Labs.   \n* Herbal products were much more likely to fail. I already try to avoid herbal products and will do that even more diligently now. In fact, for multiple brands, herbal products were the only products to fail. \n* I felt bad for a brand that had a slew of herbal supplements show up in the first 10, but applied the same scoring method to each brand. \n* I'm not judging the dose, the fillers or the items themselves, just recording the sum of Consumer Labs Pass vs Fail.\n* A high or low score may not be indicative of the overall brand, of the products not listed, or even of new batches of the listed products. This meta analysis is simply designed to give me (and hopefully you) some awareness of the quality ranges amongst certain established brands.\n* I won't post specific information about Consumer Labs test results, they are a small business and I hope this list actually encourages people to subscribe to their content - which I do, and consider it a good investment. I have not posted any confidential Consumer Labs information, just the count of pass vs fail, which is a statement of fact and not subject to copyright. Sign up link [here](https://www.consumerlab.com/join/?cltrkid=HeaderDesktop).\n\n\n\n# Detailed Results:\n\n**1st. Jarrow**\n\n*Score:* 100% (10 of 10 of PQQ, Bone Broth, Alpha Lipoic Acid, CoQ10, Probiotics, Glutathione, Vitamin B, ALCAR, phosphatidylserine, lycopene)\n\n*My notes:* Perfect result for a well known brand for high quality. \n\n  \n**1st. Natures Bounty**\n\n*Score:* 100% (10 of 10 of Vitamin E, DHEA, Black Cohosh, Acai, Iron, Melatonin, ACV, Echinacea, Evening Primrose Oil, Lutein)\n\n*My notes:* Very impressive result for a budget brand, and doubly so given how many of these were herbal supplements. \n\n\n\n**1st. NOW**\n\n*Score:* 100% (9 of 9 of Psyllium Husk, D-Mannose, Lecithin, Taurine, Glutathione, Chlorella, Digestive Enzymes, BCAAs, Melatonin)\n\n*My notes:* Another impressive result for a budget brand. No wonder they are doing the press releases calling out competitors who sell underdosed or impure products.\n\n\n\n**1st. Seeking Health**\n\n*Score:* 100% (3 of 3 of Lactase, NAC, B Vitamins) \n\n*My notes:* Only 3 products were listed, but still all passed.\n\n\n\n**5th. Nature Made**\n\n*Score:* 90% 9 of 10 Melatonin, Vitamin B, Iron, CoQ10, Sterols, Multivitamin, Fish Oil, Gingko, SAM-e, Vitamin D\n\n*One failed:* Due to overdosing\n\n*My notes:* One 1 failure, and I don't mind overdosing. Continue to be really impressed with this budget brand.\n\n\n\n**5th. Swanson**\n\n*Score:* 90% (9 of 10 of Maca, Saffron, Glutathione, CBD, NAD Booster, Olive Leaf, PhosphatidylSerine, CoQ10, Lithium, Garlic)\n\n*Failed:* One was tested as having too much lead\n\n*My notes:* 90% is solid, disappointing about the lead.\n\n\n\n**7th. Doctor’s Best**\n\n*Score:* 89% (8 of 9 of Gingko, Glucosamine, Digestive Enzymes, *L-Tryptophan,* L-Citrulline, PQQ, ALCAR, NAC, SAM-e)\n\n*Only one failed:* Consumer Labs says the tests suggest it was low dose, but mixed with another similar product\n\n*My notes:* Great result for a mid-priced brand. Moving up in my estimation.\n\n\n\n**8th. Life Extension**\n\n*Score:* 80% (8 of 10 of Saffron, Alginate, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Vitamin K, Gingko, Green Tea Extract, Ashwagandha, Boron, Potassium, Theanine)\n\n*Two failed:* One had 10% of the stated amount! Another came close at 80%\n\n*My notes:* Disappointing for such an expensive brand, and one of the failures was not even of a herbal supplement.\n\n\n\n**9th Nature's Way**\n\n*Score:* 78% 7 of 9 Coconut Oil, Aloe, Valerian, Multivitamin, Digestive Enzymes, Ashwagandha, Boron, Rhodiola Rosea, Black Cohosh\n\n*Two failed:* Sadly, both due to lead\n\n*My notes:* Cheap brand, but I'm avoiding lead, so this brand moves down in my estimation.\n\n\n\n**10th. Nutricost** \n\n*Score:* 75% (6 of 8 of Citrulline, PhosphatidylSerine, NAC, Berberine, Whey, Choline, BCAAs, D-Mannose)\n\n*Two failures:* One had 88% of the listed amount (so close), but one had just 3%\n\n*My notes:* Personally, I give the 88% a pass, but 3% is unacceptable. I will avoid the herbal supplements from them.\n\n\n\n**10th. Sports Research**\n\n*Score:* 75% (3 of 4 of Coconut Oil, Collagen, Vitamin K, Theanine)\n\n*One failure:* And it had 150% of the stated amount - up to you to decide if that's a failure or a win\n\n*My notes:* I buy a lot of Sports Research, in particular their Omega 3’s which are sold at Costco. Personally, I don't mind the overdosing.\n\n\n\n**12th. Solaray**\n\n*Score:* 70% (7 of 10 of Red Yeast Rice, Lithium, Berberine, Vitamin C, Huperzine A, D-Mannose, Calcium, Vitamin A, Aloe Vera, Black Currant Seed Oil)\n\n*Three failed:* Two due to major underdosing (65% and 5%), and one due to labeling\n\n*My notes:* A poor result from a well known brand. Moved down dramatically in my estimation.\n\n\n\n**13th. Bulk Supplements** \n\n*Score:* 57% approved (4 of 7 of Taurine, Holy Basil, Potassium, Resveratrol, Ginkgo, Chaga, L-Citrulline) \n\n*3 Failures:* The 3 that failed were due to dose (one had half the listed amount), and unclear packaging / serving information (for 2 of them) - up to you if you think that incorrect packaging information constitutes a failure\n\n*My notes:* I’ve bought from them in the past, but last is last and I can’t recommend them.\n\n\n\n—\n\nEdit: 13 brands!

Thank you to the masses of people who gave info the help me expand this list, and hopefully this can help out some other folk too!\n\n*****\n\n**This is a guide to give personal input and experiences from valued members of the /r/skincareaddiction thread on reddit. This gives an insight into the different effects, usages and other desired info that might be desired from first hand users.**\n\n*****\n\nTo gain insight into the technical aspects of any oil please refer to [this](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/carrieroils.html) guide. If you don’t want to scroll simply use ctrl+f to search the page for the desired oil to read up on the base information for it.\n\nAll oils have a limited shelf life. Please use the above guide to check the shelf life of most oils if you purchase any. Don’t use oil you think may be out of date on any part of you. You can extend the life of an oil by keeping it in the fridge, or if you have loads and won’t be using a chunk of it for a while it can be frozen. Please store your oils in the best way you have available to you.\n\n*****\n\n###If any information within this is incorrect, you have anything to add to it, or any other anecdotes then please do tell me. This was built from peoples comments and experiences so I'm happy to alter it to give a more well rounded view or accurate information where needed###\n\n*****\n\n\n**Apricot Kernel Oil**\n\n* One of the thinner oils\n* Doesn’t have a particular scent\n* Doesn’t often cause bad reactions but as always, this isn’t the case for everyone\n* Very nourishing for the skin\n* Easily absorbed\n* Though I don’t know why you would, DON’T CONSUME. Can be very dangerous\n* Has anti-ageing properties\n* Can be used to treat eczema, razor rash and sunburn\n\n**Argan Oil**\n\n* Golden brown in colour\n* Smells vaguely nutty – if it doesn’t smell very nutty it’ll be diluted cheap stuff and won’t help you\n* Very popular as a multi-use for skin and hair\n* One of the thinner oils but a little goes a long way\n* Absorbs quickly\n* Can be used effectively around the eyes\n* A favourite with respected skin care bloggers\n* Moisturising and can even out skin tone\n* Described as having a “silky” feel\n\n**Avocado Oil**\n\n* Spectacular for hair\n* Easily available at most supermarkets and shops for cheap\n* Not recommended for skin\n* Comedogenic – can cause blackheads by blocking pores\n* Goes off faster than most oils – will smell horrible and turn dark yellow when it’s off\n\n**Black Cumin Seed Oil**\n\n* Can be very quenching and result in smooth feeling skin\n* Due to its colour it can leave you a slight glow. This can be beneficial to some, but be careful in case it doesn’t work as desired for you\n* Doesn’t often break out people who are prone to acne\n* Smells like toasted nuts with a hint of caramel\n* Similar to Argan oil in consistency – quite thin, not sticky\n\n**Black Raspberry Seed Oil**\n\n* Smells fantastic according to most\n* Light green in colour\n* Full of antioxidants\n\n**Carrot Seed Oil**\n\n* Dark green in colour\n* Very powerful earthy scent – smell can linger so be wary that you may smell like it for a bit\n* If used in its pure form then be sure to dilute it. However, most types of it are macerated. (softened/diluted with liquid)\n* Very rich – not suitable for acne prone or easily irritated skin\n* Has an average absorption rate – will take a while to soak in\n\n**Castor Oil**\n\n* VERY thick and sticky/waxy\n* Is supposed to be great for improving hair growth – including eyelashes, eyebrows, scalp, etc. While this can be beneficial, some people report using it on their skin makes their peach hair darker and similar effects whereas others report no change, so be wary that this may affect you\n* Very drying so MUST be used with something else\n* Works fantastically in lip products to give your lips a glossy appearance\n* There’s so many different types of it that cause such varying effects depending on them that it’s pretty risky\n\n**Coconut Oil**\n\n* Raved about for hair because it’s one of the only two known oils that can penetrate deeply into it, allowing your hair to really be effected by it and not just coated.\n* When used on hair it’s very effective at controlling frizziness\n* Can’t just be rinsed out of hair, must be lathered and rinsed out so if you’re doing a no-shampoo regime or something then don’t use it\n* A riskier oil for skin as while some peoples skin loves it, it can cause horrific break outs in others – especially on the face\n* Refined coconut oil shouldn’t be used. It can be identified due to having barely any smell of coconut – You should only buy unrefined, extra virgin coconut oil for bodily use\n* Said that it can be used to reduce the appearance of skin marks such as Keratosis Pilaris\n* Can even be used on dogs to keep their coats healthy, if that’s a bonus to you\n\n**Emu Oil**\n\n* Mid-range thickness and milky in colour\n* A slightly unfavourable smell but not overpowering (such as Neem Oil)\n* Can be used for hair but isn’t very popular as many people don’t see desired results, so other oils are likely a better choice\n* If used correctly, it can be very hydrating\n* Not vegetarian or vegan at all – it’s emu fat\n* Is supposed to help products penetrate better, reduce inflammation, increase healing and plump your skin\n* Good for dry skin\n\n**Evening Primrose Oil**\n\n* Good for people who are acne prone, have dry skin or eczema\n* Needs diluted\n\n**Extra Virgin Olive Oil**\n\n* Rich\n* One of the thicker liquid oils\n* Effective make-up remover\n* Leaves a “plump and smooth” feeling to the skin\n* Can be very effective at reducing the appearance of SF’s\n\n**Hemp Seed Oil**\n\n* Very, very popular. Especially for use in OCM’s\n* Thin, hydrating and quick to dry down\n* Can be used on its own if it works with your skin – as a cleanser and hydrator/moisturiser\n* Ensure to wear with sunscreen\n* Strange smell - can be off putting for some\n* Green in colour\n\n**Jojoba Oil**\n\n* Dark golden yellow in colour\n* Has an earthy scent\n* Very thick. Feels almost slimy on the skin – described as “liquid wax”\n* Takes a long time to absorb so can feel almost like wearing a face mask\n* Can cause break outs – definitely patch test thoroughly\n* Is another one that can help hair growth, especially eyelashes, so can be added to mascara’s that are drying out to help\n\n**Macadamia Oil**\n\n* mildly comedogenic\n* light\n* fast absorbing\n* slight nutty smell that disappears after a bit\n\n**Mineral Oil**\n\n* Clear\n* Probably one of, if not the, thinnest oils – similar consistency to water\n* Can’t soak into the skin so can only be used as a cleanser/occlusive – better to use a moisturiser with it, but it isn’t drying\n* The least likely oil to break you out, yay! Just make sure to use un-fragranced as the fragrance can break people out. If the fragranced works for you then go for it though. (Fragranced mineral oil is just baby oil)\n* Great make-up remover\n* Probably the most popular for OCM’s\n* Leaves the face feeling very clean\n* Some people say it can make redness more apparent, but this is more specific to the user as others say it reduces redness significantly. As it’s the least likely to break you out, it’s one of the safest to try\n\n**Neem Oil**\n\n* A dark honey colour\n* Can be quite expensive\n* Extremely thick in consistency and solidifies when cold\n* Horrifically bad smelling so not for the light-hearted\n* Incredible for treating acne of all types. Will almost completely clear deep acne in a matter of days, and can do the same for surface acne in as little as 24 hours in some people\n* Despite its strength, it’s quite moisturising which is a benefit over other strong oils such as Tea Tree which can dry you out\n* Contains steroids - same steroids can also be found in many fruits and veg and can be quite beneficial, so don't fear, but just a heads up for anybody who didn't know\n\n**Sea Buckthorn Oil**\n\n* Can help even skin tone and lightening PIH\n* Bright orange in colour – can stain the skin if not careful\n* Can be used to make DIY products\n\n**Squalene Oil**\n\n* Comes in bottle and capsule version\n* Capsule version is thicker and milkier\n* Really good at helping other oils be absorbed\n\n**Sunflower Seed Oil**\n\n* Golden colour\n* Slight scent\n* An effective cleanser similar to extra virgin olive oil, but can be less clogging than it for some people\n\n**Sweet Almond Oil**\n\n* Pale yellow\n* No real smell\n* Softening\n* Doesn’t often cause bad reactions\n* Reasonably thick\n* Great carrier/dilution oil\n\n**Tamanu Oil**\n\n* Very dark green, almost black, in colour\n* Strong nutty scent but isn’t overpowering\n* Reasonably thick\n* Doesn’t absorb immediately, takes a little time but will absorb well if you leave it a little while\n* Analgesic (can relieve pain)\n* Anti-bacterial\n* Due to the above things, it can be very beneficial for acne prone or irritated skin\n\n**Tea Tree Oil**\n\n* Must be used minimally and diluted so as not to dry out or burn the skin – if used without diluting it can make your skin dry and scaly, or burn it badly\n* If used correctly it can make an effective spot treatment. One such method includes making a diluted tea tree and jojoba oil mix.\n* Can be very effective at preventing/clearing clogged pores, whiteheads and the likes\n* Anti-inflammatory properties\n* MUST use with a moisturiser\n* Has a “clean” smell\n\n**Watermelon Seed Oil**\n\n* Light yellow in colour\n* Only has a mild scent\n* Very light\n* Absorbs quickly\n* Can be quite drying so use with a moisturiser, but this makes it beneficial for oily skin\n* Good for irritated skin as it can be calming\n\n*****\n\n###If any lovely person can provide info on the following oils, I'd greatly appreciate it, and the people who requested it would too ;)###\n\n* Rosehip Seed Oil\n* Sesame Seed Oil\n* Vitamin E Oil\n* Vitamin K Oil",

    "body": "Baby girl was born on January 20, exactly 14 days after her expected due date. Multiple induction methods were used, but I think this might be a case of \"who's to say if she was induced or decided she was finally ready\".\n\nI had two membrane sweeps: one at 41+1 and another at 41+3. I used evening primrose oil and drank a boatload of raspberry leaf tea. I had the foley balloon put it at 41+5, which ended up falling out on its own. That really helped my contractions get started, but I wasn't getting to the active labor stage quickly enough. So I finally had to move on to castor oil, which I took at 1am and 3:30am and my contractions went from every 3 minutes to basically right on top of each other.\n\nFrom the beginning of the pregnancy, I was committed to having a pain-med free, intimate birthing experience at my chosen birth center. Castor oil contractions are no joke though. In the middle of a seemingly never-ending cycle of contracting, I was talking to my husband about getting a transfer to the hospital for pain meds. He stepped out of the room to call our midwife who had us come in to stay so I could labor in their tub. I am really grateful for that advocacy, because laboring in the tub immediately relieved the most intense pain and it felt a whole lot safer than continuing to labor at home.\n\nFrom arrival at the center to birth ended up being five hours. I got to labor in a warm tub, did some movement with a peanut ball, and used a contraption to help move baby down my pelvis with the midwife manipulating my hips - that movement ended up allowing me to start pushing.\n\nI did some pushing on the bed, then more on a birth stool, and finally gave birth on the floor on my hands and knees. Baby girl's shoulder was stuck, so the midwife dislodged it herself. I thought the pushing had been intense, but damn. I truly cannot compare the sensation of having someone reach up inside while trying to push out at the same time. Oooof. But I handled it and we all got the baby out and I think I will never do anything more impressive in my entire life.\n\nBaby girl was born super healthy and strong. I ended up losing quite a bit of blood. I was already anemic, so I got a pitocin shot after delivery. Then I was put on IV fluids, with more pitocin and some other medication mixed in, once I did the first nursing session. But while I was recovering, my husband got some precious bonding time with our daughter and the midwives helped feed me my lunch. While it wasn't fun to be out of commission for a couple hours, I really appreciated the care I received and that my team was there for the entire process start to finish.\n\nIf you took the time to read all this text, thank you. I hope my story can be a useful contribution to the genre.",

I’ve put them off until now, but I have an induction scheduled at 41w (Feb 2) so they told me to come prepared to have one this time so they know what the game plan will be for cervical ripening. I’m terrified. I’ve heard so many people say they’re horrible. \n\nI really, really don’t want an induction. So many horror stories. I’m doing all the stupid things. Pumping, bouncing on the stupid ball, the tea, the dates, evening primrose oil. I can’t have sex until Tue because I’m getting over a yeast infection, but I plan to try that, too. \n\nI had a really horrible bout of prodromal labor 2 weeks ago that fizzled out and absolutely NOTHING since. So I’m just feeling frustrated and scared and like my body is failing to do what it needs. I totally understand why they book inductions way out for staffing and scheduling purposes, but I HATE having a deadline. It feels like I have to have a baby in 10 days or go to a torture appointment. 🙃\n\nUpdate: Saw my normal OB today and she said there was absolutely no reason to do a cervical check until next week unless I was curious. Reading all of your positive induction and cervical check stories really alleviated my fears about next week. I feel so much more comfortable now. Thank you all so much!!!!",

You could be 0 cm dilated and go into spontaneous labor an hour later and dilate to 10 cm in 5 hours or in 25 hours. You could be 3 cm dilated and not go for a week or two. It literally tells them nothing before you are in active labor, so there is no point in doing it until active labor, and that doesn't actually change whether your labor is spontaneous or induced.\n\nThat said, I was also terrified, but I didn't find it that bad. I was already in active labor having moderately strong contractions so I can't say if it would have felt better, worse, or the same in other circumstances.\n\nI do find it concerning that your care providers have indicated that this procedure that realistically tells them nothing is not something you can decline any further at this point. Personally, it was very important that I had a doctor who gave advice and explanation and then checked for consent on everything. Yes, some things are very clearly in my or the baby's best interest and it wouldn't be responsible to decline, but it was important to me that I was still in control of my body during my labor, not subjected to whatever the doctor decided without my input. It made *everything* significantly less terrifying.",

I was over at r/tretinoin and saw a shared post on how sunblock inhibits blocks UV ([original thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tretinoin/comments/jf7k06/psa_this_is_how_important_spf_is/)). People were commenting on how the model in the video missed the neck, chest, and under eyes. And then I realized, \"wait a minute, I don't put sunscreen on my lips...\" Further wake-up via the thread on r/SkincareAddiction that unprotected lip can also lead to skin cancer ([thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8q4vvd/psa_remember_to_use_sunscreen_on_your_lips/)). Hence the search for AB lip product with SPF.\n\nI searched within AB for product suggestions on this topic but most of the discussion threads seemed to be from 4-5 years ago. So I went on to hunt for some Japanese AB lip care products with SPF. I'm here to share my findings!\n\n**Edit:** I've added to the product info whether if the company test on animal (cruelty-free)!! Fortunately, all five companies don't conduct the tests!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Things to note:**\n\n* I can't find a conclusive study or expert suggestions on how much SPF there should be for lip products ([doc here says \"15 or higher\"](https://www.prevention.com/beauty/skin-care/g26934681/best-lip-balm-with-spf/), [another says \"30 or above\"](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lip-balms-spf-protection)). I know SPF 30 is the rule of thumb for face and body, but I only found THREE products with AB lip care products with SPF 30 or higher in my search so far. I used SPF 25 as a cut off point for my list below.\n* All products should be in production (hence listing official company pages below).\n* I haven't tried any of these products, so I can't comment outside of the product specs given.\n* I have ZERO affiliation with the brands below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Product info given below:**\n\n1.

    "body": "I know this is extremely long, especially because I’m including a lot of information about my emotional state and my pregnancy as well! I loved reading detailed birth stories before Freya arrived, so I’m hoping that this will be beneficial for someone. The following is a fairly detailed and graphic recounting of one of the biggest and most important events of my life. I wrote the majority of this in the week following her birth, finished it at 6 months, and am just now getting around to posting it here, on her first birthday.\n\nI have always been completely terrified of giving birth. Childbirth has always been deeply disturbing to me – the idea of it seemed so violent, so painful, so undignified; embarrassing, even shameful. Even before my husband and I married, we’d decided to adopt exclusively, so it was a really big emotional adjustment for both of us (for lots of reasons!) when we unexpectedly got pregnant in April of 2017.\n\nMy sister has two little girls, and I’ve witnessed part of both labors. In stark, surreal contrast with the screeching, swearing, thrashing women portrayed in media, my sister labors quietly and peacefully and seems to be in total control. Through her experiences and encouragement, I came to this really important conclusion that I could actually approach birth without fear, and that a peaceful birth was possible for my girl.\n\nI read my sister’s tattered copy of Natural Childbirth the Bradley Way and learned about what each contraction was accomplishing in my body and how to visualize it. I learned and practiced the relaxation techniques and told anyone who would listen about effacement and dilation and the new confidence I’d found. I kept finding myself saying, “My body was designed for this!”\n\nI spent weeks 38-40 diligently using my breast pump, eating dates, taking evening primrose oil orally and vaginally, and walking 3 miles daily. My due date rolled around, and my cervix was still high, hard, and closed. My baby was also occiput posterior, or face-up, and I was getting nervous. Much to my distress, my OB scheduled an induction for 40+6 and I became so fearful of what an induction would do to my plan. On the one hand, I knew a sunny-side-up baby would be more difficult and painful to deliver, and this combined with painful Pitocin contractions sounded really hellish. On the other, I really wanted to have that full control over the pushing stage that I’d been imagining and preparing for, and I felt really strongly about going without an epidural. I kept hoping that labor would start spontaneously and I did everything I could to get her to flip around, but 40+6 arrived and my husband and I packed everything into the car for our 6 pm induction.\n\nI was so, so sad. I don’t know how else to really express that. I was just so sad.\n\nI got checked in and met my AMAZING nurse, Liz. She asked if I had a birth plan (I did, a pretty long one) and she read over it and discussed it with me. I was so afraid that I would be seen as high-maintenance or that the medical staff would sort of punish me for making their jobs harder with all my requests and preferences, but that just wasn’t my experience at all. Liz sat by my bed and explained all of the methods they might use.\n\nMy first cervical check around 6:30 pm revealed that my cervix hadn’t changed at all since my last appointment, so they administered the first dose of Cytotec (a pill inserted vaginally which softens the cervix). Liz told me that they could give me one dose every 4 hours, as long as I wasn’t having more than 3 contractions per 10 minute period. She said that I should settle in for what would probably be a pretty quiet, boring night.\n\nI was excited about the idea of laboring in several positions and being allowed to move around the room. I started by sitting on my yoga ball and bounced while I listened to a podcast, but after a few minutes a doctor and two nurses ran into my room in a panic because my position was putting my baby in distress. They had me lie on one side and gave me oxygen while they watched her on the monitor and then left as quickly as they had arrived.\n\nSteady contractions began, and I was so excited that something was finally happening! My method was basically to play dead. I breathed deeply and focused on relaxing every muscle of my body, which gave brilliant clarity to the work my uterus was doing. My sweet husband was there to gently remind me to relax my face, my shoulders, my hands, my legs. I could picture what was going on inside of me, just like the diagrams from my book, and it gave the pain meaning and purpose.\n\nAt 11 pm I was due for another dose of Cytotec, and a second cervical check revealed that in the last four hours, I had dilated a single centimeter. I brushed away the discouragement that swept in – it was too early to be discouraged. Being a centimeter dilated meant that I could have a Foley balloon inserted, and Liz asked an experienced doctor to do it for me instead of one of the residents. I’m super thankful for that.\n\nWhen I was obsessively reading birth stories I always wished that people would explain stuff like the Foley balloon… sorry if this level of detail is annoying! It’s essentially a mechanical way to dilate the cervix, as opposed to a chemical way like Cytotec. Two balloons sit on either side of the cervix, one inside and one outside, and they’re inflated with saline until they’re about 4 cm in diameter. They press against each other and physically open the cervix until it’s wide enough for them to just fall out. It was definitely an uncomfortable process to have it put in, but I used the same relaxation techniques that I used during labor. Once it was in it didn’t bother me at all.\n\nIn four more hours I was due for another round of Cytotec, but my contractions were too regular, so I just kept laboring through the night. Baby was still facing up, and the pain in my back was what bothered me the most. My husband massaged his fist into my lower back through every contraction, which was totally brutal for him. My full-body relaxation allowed me to snooze for a couple minutes between contractions, but he had to stay fully awake and vigilant. I don’t think I could have done it without him.\n\nA few minutes before 7 am my best friend arrived, Liz went home, and my husband finally got to rest. He showed her how to massage my back and took a well-deserved nap. I excitedly told her about Cytotec and the Foley balloon and Liz, and asked her to read to me from a book I’d been half-heartedly reading for like a year. She began to read, pausing to massage through each contraction, but eventually I was too far away and I couldn’t hear her anymore. A heavy fog came down on me, and I felt weirdly locked into that quiet and still relaxed state. I rode through each contraction with a low hum, remaining completely still between them. I had wanted to move around the room, but I didn’t want to get up anymore. I just wanted to lie there forever. Everything was heavy. A nurse tried to read me a breakfast menu but I couldn’t open my eyes to tell her that there was absolutely no way I could eat anything. The nurses didn’t seem to really be aware of when I was contracting and when I wasn’t, so I guess the play dead method was working.\n\nThe worst part was breaking my focus to get up and to go to the bathroom. I typically had a contraction as I sat up, one on the way to the toilet, one on the toilet, one at the sink, and one as I got back into bed. I just wanted to lie in my bed in peace.\n\nI tried a couple times through the morning to tug on the balloon to see if it would come out, but no dice. I tried not to be discouraged that I’d been laboring for well over 12 hours and hadn’t even reached 4 cm, but the contractions were so powerful and steady. My husband and best friend took turns rubbing my back through contractions, and I could tell they were both getting tired. I wanted to thank them for working so hard, but I could barely get my mouth to move. So tired, so heavy, so limp.\n\nAt about 11 am I got up to pee and decided to try to remove the balloon again, and this time it came out! Felt just like taking out a tampon. Y’all. It was gross. My mucus plug came out with the balloon, so I was just holding this swinging, saline-filled, testicle-looking thing covered in blood. The word “mucus” happens to make my husband retch so I tried to shield him from this experience, but my friend got a full view of me sitting on the toilet looking at this thing with wonder and disgust.\n\nI got another cervical check which revealed…. a whopping 3.5 cm. I was officially super annoyed with my body. I got back in bed, brushed away my disappointment again, and went back to trying to play dead. I was shaken.\n\nMy sister arrived around this time, and I felt totally beaten down. I told her that I wasn’t sure if I could do this, but she told me with conviction that I CAN do it, that I was strong and brave. I was totally wiped out and afraid that if my body kept this pace I’d be in labor for days. I nodded and went back to playing dead.\n\nShe told me that I could do anything for ten seconds – this became key for the rest of my labor. A contraction would start, and I would silently count backwards from ten. And then I’d count backwards from ten again. And then again, until it was over. I could do anything for ten seconds.\n\nAt noon my water broke and it contained meconium. A doctor came in and sat on my bed holding my birth plan and gently explained why she wanted to start me on Pitocin. I was terrified, but she convinced me that it was the right thing to do. I think I was partially just too tired to argue. They started Pit at the lowest dosage, and over the next two hours I had contractions stacked on top of contractions. There wasn’t any break, there wasn’t any regrouping. I could do anything for ten seconds, so I did. Over and over and over.\n\nA group of nurses came in and told me that one of them had an idea of how to flip my baby around. They had my lie on my side at the edge of the bed, leaning against their bodies to keep me from falling off. She crossed my top leg over the front of my body so it drooped toward the floor, and kept me in that position through two or three contractions before trying the same thing on the other side. Nothing really felt different to me, so I went back to laboring in my weird dream state.\n\nIt was about 1:30 when my body started shaking with the intense and overwhelming urge to push. I told my body to relax, but my body had other ideas. I thought I was probably about 5 cm dilated and I was so afraid that if I told anyone that I was getting those pushing urges that they would take dramatic steps. I kept it to myself, focusing all my energy into relaxing and not pushing.\n\nI told my husband to ask for a cervical check. And then he asked again. Then he went into the hall and found someone else to ask. It took about 20 minutes of nonstop contractions and resisting the urge to push for someone to finally come and check my progress. She looked really surprised when she told me that I was at 10 centimeters and that although it would take a few minutes for everyone to get ready, I could push at will. My baby hadn’t full descended at this point, but I felt her drop down with the next contraction and knew it was show time.\n\nThe fog lifted and I came alive. Suddenly I was full of energy. I could open my eyes and sit up and I couldn’t shut up. I chatted happily with my husband, pausing to push when I felt the urge. The room filled up with doctors and nurses, and I got really emotional looking around and realizing that all of them were women.\n\nA doctor who I feel a lot of affection for gave me some pointers about how to breathe, and, embarrassingly, I enthusiastically discussed the Valsalva maneuver with her for a moment in terms of weight lifting and birth. I was bursting with energy. Someone handed my husband an oxygen mask to put on me between contractions (seemed like overkill at the time) and I really felt like I was directing this stage. I could tell the team when a contraction was on its way and was able to push however many times I wanted before taking a break and waiting for the next one.\n\nThe “ring of fire” sensation I’ve always heard about is definitely real, and I realized that I was withholding my full effort and force in order to get as close to that pain as possible without crossing any sort of threshold. The doctor asked someone to hand her the olive oil, and I realized that I would tear. If tearing was inevitable, I decided, I just wanted to get this done. I was finally able to push past the burning and quit hesitating. Someone said, “one more push!” and I distinctly remember thinking how mean it was that they would tease me like that. I gave one more push and then it was all over – she was on my chest, crying and purple and slimy.\n\nThe order of the next few events is really blurry to me. My husband cut the cord. I know I held her while they stitched me up (two second-degree tears described as “decent”) and I know I sang to her while she opened one eye at a time to look at me. I know they took her across the room to weigh her, I know I delivered the placenta as some sort of weird anticlimactic afterthought. I know she heard her dad’s voice and craned her neck around to see him.\n\nI breastfed right away and I was shocked at how automatic and natural it seemed. How weird that she’d never latched before but just did it. After a little while they encouraged me to get up and pee, and other than a puddle of blood between my feet when I stood, it all felt pretty normal. I could get up and walk around, no sweat.\n\nIt took a few weeks to feel like my stitches were really healed, but even as I finally finish writing this (six months later) I’m having to remind myself about that part. It was painful at the time, and sometimes difficult to get in and out of bed, but it’s faded now and feels really distant.\n\nI think it’s worth mentioning that Freya was born facing the right way, which I credit to the nurses’ method of positioning me on the edge of the bed that morning! I’m so thankful for that, as pushing only ended up taking about 40 minutes and seemed more like 10.\n\nI was totally blown away throughout the whole experience how respectful everyone was in regards to my birth plan. My best friend told me that every single person who entered the room read my plan before speaking to me. No one offered me anything I didn’t want, and everything was so quiet and calm and peaceful.\n\nI don’t expect to have another baby, but if need be I would absolutely repeat this experience! My feelings surrounding birth have completely changed – there’s no need for fear, embarrassment, or shame. It doesn’t have to be scary or frantic. Even in a medical setting, even through an induction, Freya’s birth felt controlled and peaceful.\n\nIf I did things over, though, I would have slept more before my induction and brought my own toilet paper in my go bag. You live and learn.",

Either I was bitching at someone or standing in the walk-in cooler and no one could find me. Lol. So I went back on HRT. Doc said hormone blocker won't work for you. Chemo. So here I am, wishing I had a basement to hide in but I'm too far south so it would be an indoor pool. Not a bad idea in itself. But then mold would be an issue.\n\nThis may make you feel somewhat better. I live in an almost 1000 sq foot mobile home with my ex husband. Hahaha! It could be worse, he did at least figure out why he became the ex and fixed that so is a great guy now. Still not marrying him again though!",

All over the world people are suffering for various political, health, and financial reasons.\n\nI'm trying a few techniques I learned from a writer/researcher named Shawn Achor, from his book The Happiness Advantage. I'm currently journaling 3 new gratitudes per day, then writing about one good thing that happened during the day and 3 things I can remember about that good thing. The theory is that if we train our minds to actively seek out the positive moments then mentally re-live them, then they take on a bigger importance in our lives and outlook. It's a simplistic response to a complex issue of living in this modern world, but I guess over time it builds into a more positive mindset. And research shows that if you approach a task with a positive mindset you are more successful at it than if you approach with a negative or neutral mindset, so internal positivity builds more external success.\n\nIDK I'm trying just about anything over here not to wallow in the negativity swamp.",

Rare Beauty is charging $20 for their lip oils while the Etude Glass Rouge Tint costs $7.21 over on YesStyle.com.\n\n\n\nRare Beauty Lip Oil:\nWater (Aqua/Eau), Diphenyl Dimethicone, Diisostearyl Malate, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Octyldodecanol, Bis-Behenyl/Isostearyl/Phytosteryl Dimer Dilinoleyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Sorbitan Isostearate, Polysorbate 60, Pentylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Menthoxypropanediol, Ceteareth-20, Squalane, Fragrance (Parfum), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Stevioside, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ammonium Polyacrylate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Butylene Glycol, Gardenia Florida Fruit Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Nymphaea Odorata Root Extract, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Eugenol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Yellow 6 (CI 15985), Red 28 (CI 45410), Red 33 (CI 17200), Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Blue 1 (CI 42090)\n\n\n\nEtude Glass Rouge Tint:\nWater / Aqua / Eau, Diphenyl Dimethicone, Diisostearyl Malate, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Octyldodecanol, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene (Glycerin), Bis-Behenyl/Isostearyl/Phytosteryl Dimer Dilinoleyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Dipropylene Glycol, Sorbitan Isostearate, Polysorbate 60, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Ceteareth-20, Phenoxyethanol, Squalane, Fragrance / Parfum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sunset Yellow FCF (CI 15985), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Fruit Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Blue 1 (CI 42090), Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Red 33 (CI 17200), Red 28 (CI 45410)\n\n\nThe only differences I can find is that Rare Beauty added menthol to give a tingly feeling. And the oils are different. Rare Beauty uses jojoba and Sunflower oils. ETUDE uses Shea Butter, Argan Oil, Apricot Oil, Evening Primrose Oil and Sweet Almond Oil. Rare Beauty also uses Florida Fruit Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, and Nymphaea Odorata Root Extract. While Etude just uses Mango Fruit Extract.\n\nHave you seen this before, where a company dupes another company's formula and then charges more for it?",

I try to be mindful of my own naivete and lack of life experience.\n2. While I have no interest in pregnancy, childbirth, and motherhood, I actually love children and hope to have them in my life in some capacity. This only gives me pause because so many childfree people seem to really dislike kids in general, which is not the case for me.\n3. Surgery is expensive and painful. I don't know if my insurance would cover it.\n\nThat being said, I'm starting to seriously consider getting sterilized in my 20s because I'm *completely* fed up with the miserable side effects of birth control.\n\n**The Pill**\n\nThe combo pill was actually pretty great for the few years I was on it, but it gave me ocular migraines, which I eventually learned is a very dangerous side effect that indicates a higher risk of stroke. I had to quit.\n\n**The Copper IUD**\n\nSwitched to a copper IUD, which was awful. The insertion was traumatic, the recovery took forever, and even once my body had \"adjusted,\" the periods were always a nightmare. Bleeding through a tampon and pad in a matter of hours, bedridden with cramps, and, to top it all off, iron-deficient anemia from all the bleeding. Still, I stuck it out for 4 years.\n\nI finally got it taken out after a truly hellish 8-month bout of recurring, treatment-resistant yeast infections. I still don't know how much of that was due to the IUD itself or unrelated autoimmune issues (possibly exacerbated by the anemia), but it finally stopped about a month after removal.\n\n**Condoms**\n\nI used condoms for a bit after that. Condoms are *FINE,* and a very important part of sexual health. But in a committed, monogamous relationship, they really do suck. They're an expensive, wasteful hassle, and I was always stressed about them tearing.\n\n**The Nexplanon Implant**\n\nFinally, I got the Nexplanon implant about 5 months ago. And, lord almighty, **the** **acne**.\n\nThis is where I really start to question myself, because it seems so shallow, but since getting the implant, my face, back, and chest have exploded with acne. It's completely destroyed my self-esteem.\n\nI've always struggled with compulsive skin-picking to some degree (a whole different story), but with the constant breakouts, it's started to actually become a chronic problem that impedes my daily functioning. \n\nNow, I'm no stranger to acne. I've dealt with this shit all my life, and I have a tried-and-true skincare routine that includes prescription retinol. Before the implant, I had my breakouts totally under control. Not anymore.\n\nTo top it all off, I bleed/spot continuously on the implant. It only stopped once I started taking evening primrose oil supplements, and it starts up again if I forget to take them for a couple of days.\n\nI'm emotionally exhausted and honestly kind of depressed, which could be a side effect of the hormones or just a side effect of life.\n\n**The thought of starting all over again with a new birth control method is borderline unbearable.** It would be a huge relief to stop wreaking havoc on my body and never have to think about any of this again. At the same time, I worry about making a rash, permanent decision simply because I'm fed up with contraceptives.\n\nI think I just needed to vent a little bit and get some outside perspective, because I feel like I'm going crazy.",

While nulliparous women are the least likely to experience sterilization regret, I'm concerned that you may fall into this category, and it might be best to reassess in 5 yr like you originally planned.\n\nI'm child free, always adored children. I love them so much I know it's best that I don't become a parent. And I am especially repulsed by the thought of pregnancy and giving birth, always have been, never wanted to role play that stuff as a kid.  Maybe one out of my 32 years was I sorta maaaaaybe open to doimg that whole thing, although my spouse and I were riskier for five years. But we are most likely infertile, my desperate teenage atheist prayers were answered, and I'm so relieved. Zero sorrow. Nothing has fundamentally changed. Only reasons I'm not sterilized is Paraguard is a great fit for my body. However, if I lived down south with their insane laws, I'd get sterilized, in fact I probably already would be. \n\nI just wrote all this stuff to give maybe a different child free perspective, from someone whose day is brightened by children, but aware enough to know I'm not up for the 247 tired messy loud neediness of actually raising children. Or the physical process of making this baby. Only you can know, based on your lifelong thoughts and pattern of imagination, whether you are truly ready for a permanent body modification. It will eliminate a potential path, and life tends to throw you in places you'd never expect. Or your luck in certain aspects is so incredibly perfect, you feel derealization (\"how can it work out just like I'd always hoped?\")",

(Some popular apps are Clue, Flo, Me v PMDD)\n* Art/Coloring. Lots of people seem to recommend adult coloring books.\n* Weighted blankets\n* ASMR/Relaxation videos\n* Online chat therapy (There's websites like 7cupsoftea that will connect you to a \"listener\" who is just a normal person that you can just chat with for free.)\n* Organize something around your house\n* Drink some tea (Raspberry leaf and spearmint both have positive effects on hormonal imbalances)\n* Make a to-do list\n* Scream into a pillow\n* Smoking weed (I do not recommend experimenting with it, and I'm not promoting illegal drug use, but if you know for a fact that cannabis has a positive calming effect on you, then you should utilize it if necessary)\n* Light incense. I recommend lavender because it's calming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Things to avoid:**\n\n* Caffeine\n* Alcohol\n* Toxic/negative people\n* Sugar/junk food\n* Making important decisions\n* &#x200B;\n\n**Positive Affirmations/Things to say to yourself:**\n\n* You are not crazy.\n* Your feelings are valid.\n* This will pass.\n* &#x200B;\n\n**Supplements**: (obviously check with your doctor first, these is just a list of supplements that have been recommended in this sub. As far as I know, all results are completely anecdotal and not backed by studies.)\n\n* Calcium\n* Magnesium\n* B6\n* Vitamin D\n* Iron\n* Fish Oil/Omega-3\n* Chaste Berry/Vitex\n* CBD oil\n* 5HTP (careful if you're on an SSRI)\n* Melatonin\n* L-Theanine\n* Pre-Mense T (a blend, but highly recommended in this sub)\n* Panax Ginseng\n* Evening Primrose Oil",

The only thing that works right now is taking Evening Primrose Oil (EPO) after day 14 till my period.\n\nI currently take 2 1000mg gel capsules in the morning and 2 1000mg in the afternoon. Relief is immediate (30min or so). I feel brainfog lift and my ADHD meds set in. Especially when I'm studying and need to focus, this has been a lifesaver.\n\nDo take note that EPO is a phytoestrogen and I don't take it from day 1-14 because your body eventually produces less estrogen because of it. There are a few other posts on this if you search. YMMV but I hope this helps someone at least - EPO is quite affordable and I know cost is an issue for so many of us. Keep your heads up!\n\nEdit: felt like this was important to add: 1000mg (1 capsule) did nothing for me, and I only felt effects at 2000mg.",

    "body": "Heading up to the birth my preference was to go as unmedicated as possible and avoid a c-section unless it became medically advisable. To that end I was able to get on with a midwifery clinic and made plans to use my local birth centre, which was equipped with nitrous but no other pain meds. \n\nMy due date was on a Wednesday and I woke to find that I had started to lose my mucous plug but no other signs that anything was progressing. I celebrated my due date by going for a pedicure. Seriously, take the time to do a little something for yourself when you hit 40 weeks. So worth it. The woman who gave me a foot massage offered to go hard on my ankles, because there’s supposed to be pressure points that can help trigger labour. By this time I was also drinking about a litre of red raspberry leaf tea per day and taking evening primrose oil. I have no idea if any of those things helped, but I was willing to try! That afternoon I had a checkup and the midwife offered to do a cervical check (my first one). She found that I was 1-2 cm dilated and about 25% effaced, but she warned me that I could stay like that for a while. I mentally prepared to be pregnant forever. \n\nThe next morning I woke up about 3 AM with irregular, painless contractions. They gradually built up in intensity during the day, and by noon they were at a point that I was concentrating through them and many were 8-10 minutes apart. I still wasn’t convinced that this wasn’t just false labour, so at 9 that evening I took some Tylenol and got into the bath to relax. Around 9:30 I realized that this was definitely NOT false labour, got out of the bath and told my husband he needed to start timing my contractions. He promptly began a detailed Excel spreadsheet that I mocked mercilessly. My midwife team advises their first time moms to labour at home until they meet the 4-1-1 guideline (contractions 4 minutes from start to start, lasting 1 minute, for an hour), so at midnight when I got to that point they came to my home to assess me. I was 5 cm and they gave me the go ahead to drive up to the birth centre. The thirty minute car ride was not fun. I kneeled in the back seat with a bucket because I couldn’t stop vomiting. \n\nWhen we arrived at the birth centre I immediately got in the tub, even though I hadn’t been sure beforehand that I even wanted to use it. I stayed in there the whole time, as the buoyancy really helped me to be able to move around and change positions often. Being on my back seemed to hurt so much more; I spent most of my time on all fours or squatting. During this stage I was still talking and joking with DH between contractions. The first check at the birth centre at about 3 AM showed that I was now 7-8 cm. I remember being pretty pleased at my progress and thinking that I probably only had a few hours left. Then my water broke. HOLY SHIT.  I did not realize how much that ramped up the intensity of the contractions. I totally expected that I would be one of those women who labour quietly. Not so much. With every contraction I could hear myself giving this horrible wounded animal sound that I had absolutely no ability to stop. My husband says this was the hardest part for him, to know I was in pain and not being able to take it for me. \n\nTMI bit- Shortly after I started to feel like I had to poop. I know everyone says that that is what birth feels like because it’s the same muscles, but I really thought I wasn’t ready to push yet and I was just pooping in the water. It wasn’t until the midwife did another check and told me I was about to crown that I even believed the baby was moving down. \n\nI pushed for about 45 minutes in total, and Jacoby Lawrence was born at 4:18 AM on November 4th. When he came out I was on all fours and the midwife passed him up through my legs so I could pull him out of the water myself. I took him from her and leaned back against my husband’s legs, and together we unwound the cord from the baby’s legs to see that he was a boy. That moment of finding out was the best part. I am so glad we waited to be surprised – DH, who had been a little frustrated with that choice, later said when we have number 2 he wants to do the same thing. \n\nThe placenta came out quickly after so they allowed my to skip the oxytocin shot. Then with me still holding my son they all helped me out of the bath and onto the bed to be checked out. I ended up with second degree tears, mostly internal stitches but a few on the outside as well. I was really careful about sitting down for the first two weeks as I was very sore but otherwise had no problems with healing. While they were dealing with my bottom half, my baby stayed on me. That newborn frog crawl thing is so weird- he went from lying on my belly to head right under my chin. And he pooped in my hand. When I was done being patched up they helped me sit, I tried to nurse, and the midwives brought in some sparkling apple juice to toast that DH helped me drink. Best thing I’ve ever tasted. \n\nDuring the newborn exam they found that my son had a cephalohematoma, which is basically a pocket of blood between the scalp and the skull. This usually happens when forceps are used but in my case they figure it was just from his position while labouring. Three months out it’s completely gone. Other than that, baby looked great so by three hours after birth we were in the car on our way home to get some sleep in our own bed. On the drive back I sat in the back seat, stroking my baby’s cheek with one hand and drinking the rest of the sparkling juice straight from the bottle with the other. It wasn’t until a week later that I realized I had completely forgotten about the nitrous while I was in labour. I’m still kind of bitter about that. \n\nPostpartum- I love postpartum tips and baby gear advice but this has turned into a novel so I’ll post separately. \n \n[Baby Tax!](http://imgur.com/a/Gey6Q)\n\nEdit: because line breaks matter.

    "body": "Hey all!! I had posted not too long ago requesting help finding a dupe for my now discontinued lip balm, the Bite Agave Lip Mask. I took recommendations and compromised on some of my wishlist for ingredients, as I realized no one else makes a balm with an identical ingredient list. I figured in case anyone else is struggling with replacing this, I'd share what I found. \n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/kV6xjSG) are the products I've tried. Not pictured is the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, which I emptied and tossed the container.  From left to right I have the Bite lip mask, Lanolips Lanostick, Lanolips 101 ointment, Glossier Balm Dotcom in 3 flavors (original, birthday cake, and rose), Go-To Lips, Jack Black, Aquaphor, and Vaseline.\n\n**Bite Agave Lip Mask** 10/10\n\n    Ingredients: Trans-Resveratrol, Lanolin (Pharma Grade), Organic Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Organic Butyrospermum, Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Rosinate, Organic Agave Tequilana (Blue Agave) Nectar, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil Unsaponifiables, Organic Cera Alba (Beeswax), Flavor, Vanillin, Siraitia Grosvernori (Monk Fruit), Vanilla Tahitensis (Vanilla) Fruit Extract, Organic Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Trans-resveratrol, Vitis Vinefera (Grape) Oil, Tocopherol Acetate, Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, and Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, +/- May Contain: Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Carmine (CI 75470).\n\nI think what has done it for me with this one is the occlusive elements as well as moisturizers. I can see it has oils and lanolin plus beeswax. I like the thick texture which is almost sticky as well as the tube packaging. I personally like the absence of SPF as when I am really chapped those can sting/burn my lips. I also really like the smell/taste of the original. The small tube lasts a long time and it saves me a lot of discomfort in the dry winters, especially working in a hospital with all the recycled air. \n\n**Lanolips Lanostick** 8/10\n\n    Lanolin*, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil*, capryloyl glycerin/sebacic acid copolymer*, cera alba (beeswax)*, caprylic/capric triglyceride*, persea gratissima (avocado) oil*, jojoba esters (simmondsia chinensis)*, aroma (nat flavour)*, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter*, euphorbia cerifera (candelilla) cera*, magnifera indica (mango) seed butter*, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil*, copernicia cerifera (carnauba) cera*, tocopherol (vit E)* *100% natural/naturel\n    \nI feel like this one on the lips is very similar in feel to the Bite. It is probably my favorite of the dupes that I've tried. It has a lot of similar ingredients such as the lanolin, castor oil, beeswax, shea butter, and some other oils. It has a different flavor/scent than the Bite mask. It is almost citrus in nature? I think I can see myself using this one once I go through my stash of Bite (thanks to the redditor who messaged me saying Sephora kept restocking, I was able to snag some). My complaint? The fact it is a stick and not a tube! I haven't lost the cap of this in my pocket yet but that happens to me with regular sticks. I also worry the stick will break because it gets too soft from being stored in my pocket. All in all the best dupe so far.  It too got me through days at the hospital without wanting to rip my lips off my face so win.\n\n**Lanolips 101 Ointment** 7/10\n\n    Ingredients: Lanolin, lanolin oil. *naturally derived/*Dérivé naturellement.\n\nI got this one because I was already ordering from Ulta and was able to use a coupon and my points, I imagine it is basically the same as the nipple creams and other straight up lanolin out there. It is good. Tube is nice. Cap doesn't stay on super great. No color or flavor so I can use it for my cuticles and other dry patches. I can't complain but I'm not gonna sing out from the rooftops or anything like that. You can get lanolin only products much cheaper for much more product elsewhere. It does do its job locking in moisture though.\n\n**Glossier Balm Dotcom** 8/10\n\n    Ingredients: Petrolatum, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Beeswax/Cera Alba/Cire d’Abeille, Lanolin, Theobroma Grandiflorum Seed Butter, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, BHT, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol.\n\nI know I originally wanted to avoid petroleum based products but I did have a sample of it that I liked well enough so I got the 3 pack on Glossier's site to try the other flavors. Original seems to be more sticky than the other flavors and feels more like the Bite mask. It does a good enough job, the flavors are fun. I like the tube packaging. The rose is so much better than the perfume co. rose balm which is rose flavored vaseline. I feel like it did a good job moisturizing and lasting to lock in the moisture while I was at work too.\n\n**Go-to Lips** 4/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tUltra Medical Grade Lanolin, Shea Butter, Apricot Kernel Oil, Beeswax, Sweet Almond Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Vitamin E, Fragrance (Pure Pomegranate), Pomegranate Seed Oil, Calendula Oil, Jojoba Oil, Avocado Oil.\n\nI think I might be rating this lower because I had higher expectations for it. The ingredients sound great. Its in a nice tube. But its so slippery, it feels like a lip oil on the lips instead of a balm or sticky mask. It has a strong scent/flavor but it isn't unpleasant. Its so messy out of the tube though because it is so slick! I wasn't looking for an oil so I'm a little bummed. I can't say it doesn't moisturize my lips though but it doesn't have the staying power to make use of the occlusives in it. \n\n**Jack Black Lip Balm** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tBeeswax, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, C 18-38 Alkyl Hydroxystearol Stearate, Camellia Sinenesis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Flavor, Lanolin, Microcrystalline Wax, Ozokerite, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Polyglyceryl 3 Beeswax, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\nPretty middle of the road chapstick. Theres some beeswax, some lanolin, some shea butter. It has SPF though which is a negative for me for a day to day balm. I guess there isn't a lot wrong with it, it doesn't dry me out but if I am dry it stings. Its a little slicker than Bite too. I got it awhile ago as a sample and it just didn't wow me but it is a popular item.\n\n**Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy** 5/10\n\n    Active ingredient: Petrolatum (41%) – Skin protectant Inactive ingredients: Mineral Oil, Ceresin, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenol, Glycerin, Bisabolol\n\nI use this at work when I leave chapstick at home because we have samples of it everywhere. Its good for prevention of radiation dermatitis if you're into that sort of thing. It has no flavor, no taste. Its slippery and greasy feeling due to the high petroleum content. Its a solid product in general just not for my dream chapstick replacement. Good stuff though. Will continue to have on hand.\n\n**Vaseline Lip Therapy Advanced Healing** 2/10\n\n    Active ingredient: White Petroleum, USP 100%. Inactive ingredient: Flavor.\n\nLiterally marked up vaseline. What makes it more advanced than regular Vaseline?? Doesn't do much for me but vaseline never did. I bought it from the pharmacy at work when I left my chapstick at home. I do like the tube so I guess it isn't pointless. \n\n**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tDiisostearyl Malate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytosteryl / Isostearyl / Cetyl / Stearyl / Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax / Cera Microcristallina / Cire Microcristalline, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Synthetic Wax, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax / Candelilla Cera / Cire de Candelilla, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Butylene / Ethylene / Styrene Copolymer, Ethylene / Propylene / Styrene Copolymer, Mica (CI 77019), Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Dimethicone, Fragrance / Parfum, Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Methicone, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax / Cera Carnauba / Cire de Carnauba, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Yellow 6 Lake (CI 15985), Red 6 (CI 15850), Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Water, Potassium Alginate, Propanediol, Glycerin, Alcohol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Sapindus Mukorossi Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Chamaemorus Seed Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Chenopodium Quinoa Seed Extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Beta-Glucan, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Ascorbyl Glucoside.\n\nOk at the risk of sounding crunchy granola AF what the hell is some of the stuff in this? Why does there need to be a million things in this? Theres some shea butter, some synthetic wax, other wax, silicones, and other stuff in it. No lanolin or petroleum. If you're allergic to lanolin its probably good. It's not bad. Its a little too slippery for my likes in a lip product. It doesn't stay on a long time. It doesn't seem to moisturize better than any other product. It doesn't seem to hurt my lips. I don't like the little tub it comes in because I don't want to wash my hands every time I wanna put lip balm on. It costs a little much for what it is for me. \n\n\n**Closing Arguments** *TL;DR*\n\nWhile Bite may be my ride or die, its going the way of the dinosaur. Lanolips has good products, the lanostick might be the most similar in terms of ingredients/feel although the packaging is different. Glossier's balm is suitable too although it does have petroleum in it. Most of these products do have lanolin and/or beeswax in them so they aren't suitable for vegans. \n\nI'd love to hear if there are any I missed trying, despite having tons of chapstick I am a chapstick junkie so I'd be interested to hear!!",

    "body": "Hi!  I have a really simple skincare routine that has helped my skin a lot over the last year.  I wash at night with facial \"grains\" made of ground oatmeal, clay, goat milk powder, and essential oils.  Then I use evening primrose oil as a moisturizer.  I don't wash my face in the morning, and when I wake up my skin usually looks awesome - smooth, good tone, not greasy or dry (not to say I have perfect skin, as I struggle with hormonal acne, redness, and dark acne marks).\n\nFor makeup, I use mineral powder by Laura Mercier, and a little eye makeup.  Unfortunately, my skin has too much redness and acne scarring that I don't feel comfortable not wearing makeup to work.  By the end of the day, my skin looks pretty bad - more clogged pores, makeup looks like it's sitting on top of my skin, some flakey spots, redness.  Even on days I skip makeup, my skin generally looks worse at the end of the day.  This has happened with a few different kinds of makeup.\n\nWhy does this happen?  What can I do to prevent it?  Thanks for any advice!",

    "body": "I’ll start off by saying this is going to be a long post so I won’t be offended if you skip to the products/routine that worked for me.\n\nLike most others on this sub, I developed SD for this first time in my life during lockdown. I’ve always had a dry, itchy scalp but nothing I was really concerned about. I used the Body Shop Ginger Shampoo and that kept the dryness and itch in check.\n\nIn March, my state went into lockdown and my stress levels began to rise. I’d just started a new job at the beginning of the year and was dealing with severe bullying at work from my boss. In April, my scalp began to itch a lot more, and I was developing ‘crusts’, weeping and tenderness. I tried every anti-dandruff shampoo on the market but nothing worked until I used Neutrogena T-Gel. Within a few days, it had all cleared up.\n\nIn June, I began to develop itchy patches under my eyes and on my cheeks. I tried using a OTC hydrocortisone cream but it didn’t work. My doctor prescribed Advantan and Elidel for me to use until I could get an appointment with a dermatologist. I was too afraid to use the Advantan as by then, I’d read about the effects of using a steroid on my face. The Elidel seemed to work but I kept my appointment by teleconsult with the dermatologist.\n\nShe looked at my condition via Zoom and said it was perioral dermatitis and prescribed an antibiotic, and told me to continue using Elidel. The doxycycline reduced inflammation but I developed more patches on my forehead and these didn’t respond to Elidel. They kept getting darker and redder until I looked like I had chemical burns.\n\nI went back to see the dermatologist and she said I had psoriasis without even checking my elbows, scalp, knees or anywhere else for the hallmarks of the disease. She prescribed Daivobet, a really strong steroid, and told me to sit outside in the sun without sunscreen.\n\nIt raised alarm bells that she had previously told me to stop using steroids because I had perioral dermatitis and was now prescribing me a super strong steroid that said clearly on the warning label it was NOT to be used on the face.\n\nI got a referral to see another dermatologist and he was much better. He checked my skin and said it was most likely not psoriasis but could possibly be SD and possibly rosacea as well. At the time, I was using Cerave cream which the last dermatologist had insisted I use even though I told her I was acne-prone. The Cerave broke me out so badly, I had acne where I have never had acne before. I even developed fungal acne, which I had never had before.\n\nThis was the lowest point in my skin journey. I was covered in acne, SD, and my face was constantly red, itching and sensitive. I would nearly cry coming out of the shower because it was so uncomfortable and I looked like an overcooked pizza.\n\nThe second derm suggested I do a punch biopsy to be sure of my condition and I agreed. The results came back positive for SD and that was when I began my recovery journey.\n\nThis was my routine for the first month:\n\nAM\nCetaphil Cleanser,\nThe Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid and Zinc,\nOlay Complete Defence for sensitive skin\n\nPM\nMicellar Water to remove makeup (if wearing any),\nUnpasteurised raw honey mask for 1.5 hours,\nThe Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid and Zinc,\nHada Labo Perfect Gel,\nAzclear Azelaic acid lotion,\nTacrolimus on affected areas (twice daily for two weeks, once daily for two weeks. Now I no longer need it at all)\n\nSupplements I was taking:\nZinc ,\nVitamin D,\nFish Oil & Evening Primrose Oil (7 capsules daily in first week, down to 3 capsules after skin had settled, now I take one daily),\nVitamin C,\nBroad spectrum probiotic\n\nWhat made the most difference:\n\nDiscovering the folliculitisscout website through this sub and r/asianbeauty. I was previously using sezia.co and it missed a lot of malessezia feeding ingredients. I’ve discovered that I’m hypersensitive to anything that can feed the fungus. If there’s even one ingredient in there, I will develop stinging, itchy patches within hours.\n\nHada Labo Perfect Gel. I believe that a lot of the issues with SD developed due to a combination of stress, lack of vitamin D and exercise and an impaired skin barrier. When we went into lockdown, I only washed and moisturised my face once a day (used to wash twice) and my hair, once every four days. I think the lack of moisture led to dryness and eventually, an impaired barrier. Hada Labo Perfect Gel has been my holy grail. Within a couple of days of using it, my skin felt plump, calm and happy. I also believe the urea in the cream helped with healing and keeping the SD at bay.\n\nAzelaic acid. This stuff is incredible. It not only got rid of the residual acne from using Cerave, it also faded the acne marks and pigmentation left by the SD. I believe the antibacterial properties in this is also keeping the SD at bay.\n\nRaw honey mask. I can’t recommend this enough. Within days of using the honey mask, my skin was less inflamed and just felt a lot calmer and softer. But if you are going to try using this, please only use unpasteurised raw honey. I tried normal raw honey and it actually made my SD worse. I get my raw honey from someone who keeps bees so I know it’s 100% unpasteurised.\n\nI have been clear for months and now my focus is exfoliating to even out skin tone and keeping my pores clear. This is my daily routine now:\n\nAM\nCetaphil cleanser,\nCosRX AHA/BHA clarifying treatment toner,\nTO Hyaluronic Acid,\nOlay Complete Defence\n\nPM\nMicellar water as makeup remover,\nCetaphil cleanser,\nClear Skincare 2% Salicylic Acid toner only on oily parts of my face,\nCosRX AHA/BHA clarifying treatment toner,\nTO Hyaluronic Acid,\nHada Labo Perfect Gel,\n(Wait 5 mins) Azclear lotion on acne prone areas and SD areas,\n\nIf anyone is interested in SD safe makeup, this is what I have been using:\nBourgeois Healthy Mix Serum Gel foundation,\nThin Lizzy mineral powder foundation or mineral liquid foundation. Both are SD safe,\nBare Mineral blush,\nRevlon Photoready Candid Concealer,\nNyx Can’t Stop Wont’ Stop Concealer,\nLipstick, mascara and eyeshadow don’t trigger my SD at all so I use any products\n\nI will add the disclaimer that this worked for me, but I’ve learned that every single SD case is slightly different. Our bodies are all completely different as would be our SD triggers. I stopped drinking caffeine and alcohol for weeks and it made no difference. The only thing that worked for me was supplements, going out for a walk every other day, and repairing my moisture barrier.\n\nI hope this helps people on this sub because I know how depressing and gut wrenching this disease can be. I spent countless nights awake at 3am reading up on how to fix it. I didn’t want to see anyone and hated seeing myself in the mirror. Now I can go makeup free without scaring anyone :)\n\nEdited for formatting",

    "body": "I've had hormonal acne since I was 18 (go figure, I got it after high school, so I didn't have it when everyone else did, but now I do as an adult) and now I'm 25. I've pretty much tried everything for it besides accutane and professional treatments. I usually break out on my jawline, they're painful, and they scar super easily. I've had to live with this my whole adult life, and have coped by wearing a full coverage foundation pretty much any time I'm around anyone, but it's always been my biggest insecurity.\n\nOver the years, I've tried all the different washes, masks, and at home remedies. I did the whole super minimal routine thing to see if a product or ingredient was breaking me out. I went to a dermatologist years ago who put me on birth control and while that helped diminish it slightly, it wasn't a total solution. She also put me on adapalene, and that helped the texture but didn't stop me from breaking out. I've done different products from The Ordinary like niacinamide and the peeling solution treatment (again, helped with texture and scarring but didn't stop the breakouts). I took evening primrose oil supplements because I read on here that they were helpful for some people; those didn't change anything. Spot treatments help clear up a blemish that already exists but nothing I've tried has been able to halt new breakouts.\n\nThen, I finally decided I'd try the whole spearmint tea thing. I figured it was one of the few things left I hadn't tried, and what could it hurt? I picked up one box of Traditional Medicinals spearmint tea, and made one a day in the morning. The box lasted me around 2 weeks. In that time, my painful jawline acne actually started to reduce! I wasn't sure if this was a product of the tea, or if it was just total coincidence (I'd also switched moisturizers at the same time I started the tea), but when I ran out, I was unable to get more for around 5 days. In that time that wasn't drinking it, my jawline acne came back with a VENGEANCE. And then as soon as I was able to start drinking it again, it started to heal and clear up, and the amount of new breakouts seriously reduced.\n\nSo, all of that to say: if you know your acne is hormonal, and you haven't tried spearmint tea yet, give it a go! I wish I would have done it sooner but I honestly thought that couldn't be a real solution and that it wouldn't have been worth it. I'm very very glad I gave it a shot and I'm curious to see what my skin will be like in a month and beyond!",

    "body": "*Long, TL;DR: at the bottom*\n\nLO2 is 10 days old today and I have a few minutes to share my birth story.\n\n\nWe have a 2yo DD, and I went to 41+3 with her and ended up being a cytotec induction. It was overall very positive, but I really wanted to experience \"real\" labor this time around. I just really wanted the classic contractions starting, getting closer together/more painful, looking at DH and saying, \"honey, it's time!\" experience. \n\n\nHowever, I'm also starting nursing school at the end of January. So I went ahead and scheduled an induction for 40+1, because as much as I wanted to let LO cook and come on their own, Mama's on a schedule right now. \n\n\nSo in order to try not to make it to my induction date, I started taking evening primrose oil, drinking red raspberry leaf tea, and bouncing on the exercise ball every chance I got starting about 38 weeks. At 39 weeks, I started pumping to try to bring on labor.\n\n\nNow, this time around, I had a unique perspective I didn't have with my first. I now work in L&D (in a clerical capacity) at the hospital where I delivered both babies. I've learned so much over the past year and a half about childbirth in general, but I've seen first hand how many moms roll up thinking it's go time, only to be sent home when their contractions started spacing out after rest or water. And I did *not* want to be one of those moms.\n\n\n\nSo I was trying all of these different methods to induce labor. One night, about 38 weeks, I started having regular contractions that were uncomfortable, but not painful. I told DH I would try to sleep through them, but if I couldn't, we were going in.\n\nI went to sleep and didn't feel another one.\n\nI had a couple more days like that. For at least a week I was having contractions 10 minutes apart lasting 60 to 90 seconds, they just weren't painful (my belly would just get really tight). Sometimes they'd space out for a while, but if I was on my feet, that's how they'd be.\n\nI spent all of my time at the desk at work bouncing on the birthing ball, hoping something would happen. My coworkers would offer to check me or sweep my membranes, but after being generously called \"probably 1, maybe 2cm\" at my 38 week appointment, I didn't really want to endure extra cervical checks to be disappointed.\n\nI worked my last day when I was 39 weeks exactly, on 12/22 (it was the last shift before my due date), and finally gave in to the suggestions. I'd been contracting 8-10 minutes apart for days and was hoping something had changed. \n\nOne of the nurses checked me and told me I was 3-4cm! Finally some sort of progress! I was optimistic that I would spontaneously go into labor now. She even offered to put me on the monitor for a bit and then call my doctor, certain she would keep me. \"You could stay tonight, have a baby, and be home before Christmas!\" she said. I would have taken her up on it, but it was 11pm, my parents live almost 2 hours away and were supposed to watch DD, and I personally wanted to keep baby's birthday further from Christmas if I could. \"Well,\" said the nurse, \"you go home and you grab him [DH] and take him to bed. You guys have some really rough sex, and I guarantee we'll see you back this week!\" (I have a really chill relationship with my coworkers, you can't really work in healthcare without getting relaxed with each other). \n\n\nSo I went home and decided to just relax. We didn't want a Christmas baby, so I took it easy, although my contractions never completely stopped. We enjoyed a nice, relaxed Christmas at home instead of a hectic one two hours away with multiple stops to see family, and it was just really nice.\n\n\nChristmas was over, so I set back on my determination to induce labor at home. I had my 39 week appointment on 12/26, doc called me still 3-4cm. So I went home and followed my co-worker's advice. DH and I went at it, then I walked circles in our house for a bit, then bounced on the exercise ball while I pumped.\n\nContractions had really picked up and gotten painful after sex. They were 2-4 minutes apart, but weren't unbearable and never actually got worse. I went on like that for about 6 hours then decided to get a hot shower.\n\nAfter the shower, my contractions spaced back out to about 10 minutes apart and just uncomfortable or mildly painful. So we stayed home.\n\n\nWe repeated this entire process every day until Monday morning. I would contract about 2 minutes apart, painfully, then they'd taper off or I'd be able to sleep through them. I just wanted my water to break so that I had a clear cut sign to go in.\n\nBut, we made it to induction day. My mom and sister came down to watch DD and off DH and I went to the hospital at 6am, stopping on the way to get donuts for everyone.\n\n\nIt was weird being on the other side of everything. I honestly was a little nervous that it would be awkward being in such an exposed position with my coworkers, but they were awesome. Everyone was chill and it was like it was no different than hanging out at work, but they were also  professional.\n\nSo 6:30am, we got all checked in and settled, and I was contracting on the monitor every 3-4 minutes, just not painful.\n\n8:00am, the nurse starts pitocin on 2mg and my doctor comes in to check me and break my water. It was light meconium, so respiratory would be present at delivery just in case. \n\n\n5cm. I rolled up to my \"induction\" at 5cm and 80% effaced. Ya'll, if I had gone into L&D at any point in the previous 4 days while I was contracting, I would have already had a baby by this point.\n\n\nThe pitocin never got increased because I was already in active labor. After the doctor broke my water, the nurse asked if I wanted her to start prepping for an epidural. I said, \"sure, why not,\" thinking if I decided I wanted it, I'd be ready, and if I didn't want it, no big deal.\n\n\nA couple of contractions later, I was definitely ready for it. Once your water breaks, everything gets more intense.\n\n9:30am, the anesthesiologist finally comes in to do my epidural. Now, I'd had an epidural the first time, ended up with a \"hot spot\" on my right side where I could still feel everything in the top of my right thigh, bottom of the right side of my abdomen, and basically the right half of my pelvis. When that happened, the nurse gave me the peanut ball and had me roll to my right side, 15 minutes later I was totally numb.\n\nThis time, I had the same \"hot spot\". I told them what happened last time, we tried to fix it, I had some relief but not complete. We tried everything short of taking the epidural out and redoing it, but I decided I had at least enough relief to not redo it. The anesthesiologist said it's probably something with my anatomy preventing the medicine from getting to the nerves on my right side. No biggie, just not entirely effective epidurals, apparently.\n\nAnyway.\n\n11:30am, got to 8cm. It was basically just a waiting game at that point. My coworkers were occasionally dropping in to say hi, and it was so awesome to see how excited everyone was. We didn't know LO's sex, so everyone was super excited to find out and everyone was taking bets. The general consensus at the nurses' desk was girl, so my nurse was saying boy.\n\n12:00pm, my epidural started wearing off. Not only was I feeling the hot spot, I was hurting all across my abdomen and each contraction was hurting worse. The nurse called anesthesia, and another doctor came to redose my epidural, which took my relief back to what it was before. The nurse wanted to check me since I was hurting worse anyway, and I was complete and ready to push!\n\nI got up in stirrups and started pushing. Maybe I'm weird, but both times I've made DH stand at the end of the bed to watch the baby be born. He can handle gore really well, and if I had to go through it, he had to watch it.\n\nThe nurse who had checked me the week before came in to say hi. \"They've got hair!\" says my nurse to the other nurse, \"you want to see?\" Y'all, it sounds weird, but I was seriously like, \"yeah, get in here and check out this baby coming out of my vagina!\" I really didn't care at all.\n\nSo, a few pushes later, the nurse calls everyone in. A tech, the doctor, nursery, and respiratory since there was meconium.\n\n12:26pm, about 20 minutes of pushing later, I looked up above me at a light that was turned off, and I can see my reflection. One more push, and I watched LO's head appear, then one shoulder and another, then a whole baby.\n\n\"Oh, we have a boy!\" says DH. I smiled so big, tears filling my eyes, and saw DH with tears in his as well. The only other time I've ever seen him cry was when DD was born.\n\nThey laid him on my chest and he started to cry. I had delayed cord clamping, DH cut the cord, and DS (!!!) immediately tried to lift his head from my chest and look around. Exactly like my DD did when she was born.\n\n\nHe came out and cried, but because I hadn't pushed for long, he still had amniotic fluid in his respiratory system that hadn't been squeezed out. He coughed and gagged a little, so I passed him to nursery and respiratory to suction him out really well.\n\n\nThe last few weeks of pregnancy, I kept telling DH that this kid had to be big. I felt like their head was already halfway into my vagina, but was feeling feet in my ribs. I swore they were an 8lb baby (DD was 7lbs 2oz). And I said as much when they went to weigh him. The nurses didn't think he was quite that big, but then put him on the scale.\n\n\n8lbs even, 20.5 in long. I'm 5'2\", weighed 115 lbs pre-pregnancy, so a kind of big baby for me. I had a first degree \"tear\", doc put in one single stitch just because it wouldn't stop bleeding. \n\n\nHe immediately breastfed for 30 minutes, then DH went and got DD from my parents in the waiting room. She was so calm and gentle, she kissed him and looked over his hands and feet, touched my face and told me how cute he was. \"He come out Mama's belly?\" she said. We'd told her the night before we'd be going to get the baby out of my belly. She totally connected it, it was so sweet. She was so excited to be a big sister, and is still so incredibly helpful and sweet with him.\n\nSo yeah, that's my story. Totally different from DD's birth, still positive.\n\nTL;DR:  Team Green. Prodromal labor; tried to induce labor at home, contractions would be intense, then taper off. If I'd have gone into L&D, they would have kept me, but I didn't think it was real labor. Rolled up to my \"induction\" at 40+1 at 5cm, got an epidural that partially worked, pushed for 20 minutes and had an 8lb 0oz, 20.5in baby boy 6 hours after getting to the hospital. First degree \"tear\", one single stitch. Positive experience, he is adored by all of us but mostly by his big sis.\n\n\nRowan Lee Grey H., born 12/30/19, weighing 8lbs even, 20.5 inches long.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/uTKLVAA",

    "body": "[Baby tax!](https://imgur.com/mpveDHP)\n[More baby tax](https://imgur.com/X0Xlmsa)\n[one more :)](https://imgur.com/vGoYO6V)\n\nIn honour of today being my due date, I will share my birth story! I like the wordy stories with lots of details so that's what you're getting.\n\nLast Sunday, I was 39w+0 and I hadn't seen a single sign of labour yet. I hadn't had any early contractions...in fact I hadn't even had any Braxton hicks my entire pregnancy. I hadn't lost any mucus plug or had any bloody show. Not a creature was stirring on the uterus front. I have no idea how dilated or effaced I was...I didn't have a single cervical check my entire pregnancy which I loved! I also never weighed myself nor did my midwives tell me I should, so I have no idea how much I gained. I LOVED this part of being in midwife care.  No peeing in cups or on strips either...they checked my blood pressure at every appointment and that was sufficient. But I digress...\n\nI had been given the all-clear by my midwife to start trying to bring labour on with all the totally unproven and unscientific methods so I figured why not....I was eating dates, pineapple, spicy foods. For three days prior I had been taking evening primrose oil (two orally one vaginally), and drinking red raspberry tea. I walked a lot and even managed to have sex (and enjoy it) once...what a feat at that stage!\n\nSo, Sunday night (September 18) my husband and I were watching the Walking Dead and eating Oreo ice cream sandwiches. I felt a tiny little cervix punch and thought it was unusual cause my baby hasn't kicked me there in months. Then I felt a tiny bit of fluid escape...it felt like I had gotten my period suddenly. I went to the bathroom and peed and wasn't sure if it was my waters because it really does feel exactly like peeing (I thought it would feel different for some reason). So, I was uncertain and I went back to the couch and debated whether or not to even say anything to my husband cause he is a super worry-wart and I didn't want to get him riled up unnecessarily. As I was considering this, I felt another gush and ran back to the bathroom....and knew for sure this time. My waters had broken, I was going into labour!  I sat on the toilet freaking out for a moment and realized I have a choice: I can freak out and start to panic or I can get excited. I chose the latter!\n\nI called my doula and midwife to let them know. The plan was for me to labour at home as long as I could, then my midwife would come to my apartment and assess if it was hospital time or not. I was GBS negative and the amniotic fluid was clear so rushing to the hospital wasn't necessary. \n\nI wasn't experiencing contractions yet so they told me to try to get some rest. I had to sent my husband to the drug store for Gravol to try to aid with sleep (as per my midwives recommendation). Somehow I did manage to fall asleep for a couple hours and I woke up to mild contractions around 12:30am (4.5 hours after my waters broke). I guess I'll consider this the start time of my labour?  I figured sleep was now futile so I woke up and started timing contractions. They were about 45 seconds and every 8 minutes apart and pain-wise they were quite manageable for a couple hours. Around 2am I woke my husband and told him I needed him to be with me cause they were really starting to hurt and I was having problems timing them on my own...and I was getting scared for what was to come!  Contractions are such an unusual pain, and they are so powerful.\n\nI got into the bath and it was helpful and pleasant but not for long. My contractions were really ramping up fast. Consistently 45 seconds but they were under 5 minutes apart for over an hour.  Our doula came over and we made the decision to call the midwife too. I was already in so much pain...I was amazed at my body and the things it was doing to get through each contraction.  Weird positions I never dreamed of, weird sounds coming out of my mouth.\n\nThis is interesting: my husband mentioned that I had a really strong, kind of musty smell and it reminded him of the first time we had sex. Pheromones at work!\n\nMy midwife arrived and checked me and I was so scared it would be bad news (hardly dilated) cause I was so so so ready to go to the hospital where there was pain relief. I was 4cm....hooray!  Off we went! The car ride was as terrible as everyone says. I was laying in the back seat writhing in agony. I remember hearing stories of women sitting and doing up their seat belts for this ride...ha ha yeah don't do that.\n\nFinally at the hospital (which was only a 10 min drive), I immediately requested gas and air. I was curious to see how this would work because I've done my fair share of whippits in my lifetime (ha ha) and I couldn't imagine how it would help with such intense pain. It was great though!  It immediately calmed me down because I had to really focus on my breathing, and it gave me a tiny break from the intensity of the contraction. It was very helpful, I highly recommend it.\n\nI was really uncertain about whether or not I'd get an epidural. I trust in modern medical technology and science and why wouldn't I get one? But I did want to try to go as long as I could without one because I really felt that gave me the best chance of an intervention-free birth. Also, having a doula really helped inspire me to do my best without meds. Not only was she so awesome at being supportive, but I paid a lot of money for her help and I wanted to make that worthwhile (oh goodness, amusingly I realize now there is some truth to that). One final thing that made me want to try to go without an epidural was my husband let it slip that he thought I had a 2/10 pain tolerance. This revelation made me so mad, so I kind of wanted to prove him wrong.\n\nOnce I was calmed by the gas and air, I did say that I'd like to discuss getting an epidural and my midwife told me that I'm progressing so fast that by the time the anesthesiologist arrived it would probably be too late...and that made sense and I didn't think about asking again. Which amazes me in retrospect!  I had a secret word to say to make my husband know I was serious about the epidural...this actually worked well for us because he had some amount of confidence that I was doing okay without one. Watching me in such pain was a crazy experience for him.  He later told me that it's a good thing we've watched so much Walking Dead lately as it prepared him for the gore he was witnessing...\n\nDetails start to get foggy here. I did go in the shower briefly but I couldn't handle standing or sitting there for long. Oh and apparently you can't bring the gas and air in the shower with you, despite what my midwife told me (she totally tricked me to get me in there in retrospect, LOL).\n\nI got checked again (probably around 7am?) and I was 9.5cm. Holy crap...things were moving along so crazy fast!  My contractions were taking on a whole new level of intensity. My back was aching after each contraction and I was told that was good as it meant baby was coming down.\n\nOne thing often missing from birth stories, cause it's impossible to describe, is how totally animalistic you become. I was INSANE, I was possessed, I was unleashing a super power...my body was taking over and I was just attempting to hold on for dear life. I was terrified of what was happening but only briefly because my body was too busy doing stuff to let me be terrified for long. \n\nMy body started trying to push around 8am. My midwife was scrambling for help because the second midwife hadn't arrived yet (you need two there for the birth, one for baby and one for mom). I was progressing crazy fast especially for a first time mom. I was checked at 10cm and given the clear to push and so I started pushing. \n\nAnd for the next three hours I pushed.  Turns out baby wasn't facing the ideal way (towards my back), instead he was facing sideways. So pushing was crazy hard, as I needed to move him around my pelvic bone. I had to try so many different positions and push in such bizarre ways. At some point the other midwife arrived and then a third came to help too....plus I had a student midwife there to observe for her schooling...plus my doula and my husband. It was crazy! So many people around me, feeding me water and juice through straws, massaging me, holding my hands, cheering me on.  I laboured on the toilet for a while cause it was opening up my hips really well and I swear I almost broke the toilet seat yanking on it all crazy like...that was memorable.  The other memorable position: they put this bar up on the bed that I could pull down on while squatting, and they got this birthing stool for me to squat on (round with a hole in the centre). What a sight that must have been!\n\nThis one midwife in particular was so freaking amazing. She came up to me and talked to me directly a few times to get me back to my senses. She could tell that I was shying away from the pain and she somehow convinced me that I needed to embrace that pain and go towards it because that was how I was going to finish this and I amazingly listened to her.\n\nEveryone kept saying I was going to meet my baby soon and I was at the point of not caring anymore...that was not an incentive. I decided I didn't want a baby anymore.\n\nI was pushing and pushing and nothing was happening and suddenly I felt this one push do something different and everyone cheered and I guess I finally turned baby to where he needed to be. \n\nI remember being briefly scared about having to push the baby out past the \"ring of fire\" and then realized I didn't care how much it hurt at that point, I just wanted to be done. And it wasn't bad at all. I mean it was bad, but after what I'd gone through it didn't matter. People were getting so excited, yelling about seeing hair and head. I was asked if I wanted a mirror and I did not. I didn't really believe them that he was coming cause they'd been telling me that for hours.  Finally at 10:50am his head popped out and his body slithered out after him on the next contraction. The midwife told me to pick up my baby and I said no (ha ha) and she told me again to pick him up and she put my hands around him and helped me to lift him onto my chest. He was wet and slimy and warm and had an unforgettable smell.  He started crying immediately and we just laid there in shock. I always imagined myself crying with happiness at this point. I did not cry. I was too relieved and tired and emotionally drained. \n\nHe looked like....exactly what he was supposed to look like.  Like I knew his face already, and I just needed to be reminded.\n\nThe placenta delivery is a total non-event. I could hardly tell it was happening.  I had a second degree vaginal tear and a perineum tear that needed stitching. They had to do some local freezing as I hadn't had the epidural. Again, pain was kind of irrelevant at this point so the stitching was uncomfortable but no biggie. The uterus massages they do after to get it to shrink definitely suck.  I kept experiencing small contractions for a few hours after, especially when baby was trying to nurse.\n\nIt is amazing how you go from such wild crazy pained maniac to this calm serene being in a matter of seconds. And you just lay there with your baby, this little human you've waited so long for. And all that pain fades away.\n\nHealing has been great. Way easier than I thought it would be. Yeah I'm a bit sore and bleeding but it's so worth it. Every day it gets better. Having an adorable little baby to distract me from any discomfort sure helps!\n\nI am really pleased that I did it without an epidural. I do think that had I got one, I would not have been able to push the baby into the correct position. I needed to be able to move around freely for that.  I also needed to be able to feel the pushing to understand how to change things up. I pushed for so long there was almost intervention...apparently the midwife was right on the verge of calling for assistance (forceps or c-section) but I got him out just in time. Hooray!\n\nThat's my birth story! What a wild ride. Good luck to everyone!\n\nBaby was 8lbs 8oz.\n\n",

I was terrified of an epidural but totally wanted one when transition hit (I only had active labor for like 40 minutes before transition started and I thought that was going to last for hours and FREAKED). I used my code word (beetlejuice for us) with vigor but they just don't give you an epi. when you're 9.5cm and in transition. ;)\n\nI cannot imagine pushing for 3 hours though! You are a total rockstar  for doing that epidural free for that amount of time. Love your description of labor being animalistic, I definitely felt that way too and thought that was a great way to put it.\n\nI'm so glad my health system now allows gas as well so I can hopefully utilize it for this birth. I haven't seen a lot of birth stories where it's utilized so I thanks for sharing! \n\nYou're little man is just sweet as can be. CONGRATULATIONS!",

    "body": "I had a **lip blush** PMU (permanent makeup) tattoo done this summer and chose such an intense color, and it ended up healing red/purple on my lips and the inside of my lips wouldn’t take any color so my lips became two-toned. I didn’t like that it looked like I was wearing half lipstick every day so I looked into removing it.\n\nFound out from multiple sources that **saline removal does not work**, and found out about the Quanta **Q-Evo laser** from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrobladingRemoval/comments/14fkr2r/lip_blush_removal_success/).\n\nI called every laser tattoo removal place in Los Angeles and **everyone was afraid** to laser remove face/red ink/lip tattoos lol except one place in North Hollywood called Pure Skin Laser Center. I was in and out of there in 5 mins, it’s so fast (very painful though, like an instant sunburn feeling).\n\nI was their first lip patient, and about 50% of the ink came out the first round, and after the second round, it’s about 80% gone now. I paid $250 per session, two sessions so far (might do a third but we’ll see if this continues to fade).\n\nI wouldn’t recommend any other laser for lip blushing removal, even for other tattoos. It seems like the Quanta Q-Evo one can target any color and is very powerful so there are fewer sessions needed than other lasers.\n\nThe ingredients of the **lip balm** I used to keep them moisturized was Avocado Oil, Coco Butter, Sunflower Oil, Castor Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Aloe Leaf Extract, Carnauba Wax, Candelilla Wax, Vitamin E.\n\nYou can see the **results in the photos**. If you have any experiences with saline or laser removal, please do share and if you have any questions, ask away!\n\n**TLDR:** I had lip blushing done, didn’t like it, got it removed with the Quanta Q-Evo laser at Pure Skin Laser Center in North Hollywood, CA for $250 a session. I was their first lip client and my lips are looking close to normal now after 2 sessions.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rw10l1kqwcnb1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=3083710e59325af9a7b5ba0d7dcf4f2fa645efbb\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8a96f7hizcnb1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=22dd285e3209f3c453b8c7e67e88e072f19b1201",

    "body": "First, [my birthplan](http://imgur.com/OcGSqYw). All the nurses got a kick out it :)\n\nTL;DR: baby trolls us, 23 hour labor, happy healthy baby, I am so in love I think I may explode.\n\n#The Prelude\n\nI went to my OB appointment on September 6 at 39+5 and was 1.5cm dilated and 80% effaced - the same I'd been for 3 weeks. He offered to sweep my membranes but the cervical check was so painful that I declined. (If I'd made it to my next appointment, I'd have definitely gone for it.) We scheduled an induction for 7:30 am on September 14 in case baby girl wouldn't budge on her own, and I immediately set about doing all the things that are \"supposed\" to induce labor: spicy food, sex, labor cake, evening primrose oil, raspberry leaf tea... I even went for long walks despite the ever-growing pain of my SPD. I lost my mucus plug over the weekend but had zero other signs of labor, so I was more and more convinced I'd wind up going to my induction date.\n\nThe night of Monday Sept 12 I noticed a decrease in fetal movement. I called my OB and he told me to head to the birth center for monitoring. Of course baby girl is fine. Heartbeat good and strong, and she gave the monitor a hard kick for good measure. The nurse said I had a small contraction while I was there, but I didn't feel it. She said they could keep me and induce then and there, but I opted to go home and get some sleep. My next OB appointment (where I'd planned to get the sweep) was the next day, so what the hell, right?\n\nDH and I stopped at our favorite ice cream place a block from the hospital on the way back. I am convinced the reduced movement was a ploy by baby to (1) give us a dry run at getting to the hospital and (2) get some ice cream.\n\nThat night DH slept in the guest room, as he'd had trouble sleeping the last few nights as I got more and more uncomfortable. He wanted to get one more night of solid sleep before possible baby time.\n\nHa.\n\n#The Birth\n\nI woke up at 5am on September 13 to a warm trickle. It was *not* pee, I could tell right away. I lay there for a minute trying to work out what was happening, and then sprang out of bed and into the bathroom.\n\nYou know how they say that washing a car is the surefire way to make it rain? Apparently washing your sheets is the surefire way to get your waters to break! I only got a drop or so on the sheets, but my jammies were soaked! (I put on one of those big overnight pads and continued to drip/gush for basically the rest of labor.)\n\nNot 5 minutes later I felt my first contraction. It was less painful than even my mildest period cramps, and they stayed pretty low-grade for a while. Since my water had broken, I gave my OB a call and he said that I should head into the hospital in the next few hours, by 10am at the latest. I decided to give DH a few more hours of sleep and went downstairs to knit and watch House of Cards.\n\nAt about 7:30 I woke up DH by saying, \"We're having a baby today!\" He was groggy and confused but then excited! So much for one last night of super solid sleep. He took a shower, we snuggled the cat for a while, then packed up the last few things we needed (some of which we would surely have forgotten if not for the trip to L&D the night before!), and headed out.\n\nFirst, a stop at Starbucks for a pumpkin spice latte. I have priorities, dammit.\n\nWe arrived at the hospital around 9am and they got me hooked up to the monitors. Contractions were painful by this point but not super bad. Baby was looking great, so they unhooked me and I labored for a while on the bed and the ball. (And yeah, I kept knitting in between contractions for as long as I could.) I had wanted to try walking around and getting in the tub/shower, but sitting was the most comfortable position for me.\n\nI didn't really keep great track of my contractions through all of this, but they were consistently a minute-ish long and 4-6 minutes apart the entire labor. Also, we joked with the nurses that I have a shy uterus. My contractions would be coming along regularly, then the minute one of them walked in the room and I had to talk to them (as opposed to just focusing on the contraction or relaxing with DH), they would slow down. Uterus does not like company!\n\nAt 1pm everything was ramping up and I was having a hard time. DH had to remind me that there is no medal for being in pain, and you don't win anything for have an unmedicated birth. So I asked for the nitrous at 1pm and ooooooooooh man that stuff is nice. It doesn't take the pain away, exactly, but it makes you feel all floaty and calm so that you can't really focus on it. They checked me at 2:30 (yay nitrous making that easier) and I was at 3cm. Not great progress but they were okay with letting me continue to labor without drugs for a while. I was able to eat in between contractions and huffs of nitrous and felt okay for several hours.\n\nBy 5pm the contractions were pretty terrible - I could no longer breathe through them and the nitrous wasn't helping much anymore - so I asked for the candyman... After my husband had to again remind me that you don't get a medal in pain. My main reason for not wanting an epidural was that I'd wanted to be able to move around freely during labor, but by that point I was pretty much stuck in the bed with pain anyway. The anesthesiologist was really great, and the whole process was smooth and not painful at all. It hurt less than piercing my ears. And the relief from the pain was like the sweetest drug ever.\n\nNote: They had to special-order my epidural meds because of my reaction to narcotics - I didn't have fentanyl in it, which was probably the cause of what happens later...\n\nI was totally dead from the waist down and couldn't move or feel my legs, which was fine by me. They checked my cervix again at 6pm and I was STILL only 3 cm! The nurse came in to talk to me about starting pitocin, and I decided it was fine with me since I had the epidural in. We kept the dose as low as it would go.\n\nI was able to rest a little bit and was 5-5.5cm dilated at 10pm. I think they dialed up the pitocin a little bit at this point but I was pretty groggy and don't really remember.\n\nI did slowly become aware that I could feel my left hip. Then I could feel my left thigh. Then I could feel my left stomach. By 11pm, the epidural had stopped working completely on everything north of my knee on the left side.\n\nYou guys. Holy crap. I could not deal with the pain. It took them an hour and a half to get things sorted out and I was in tears the entire time. It felt like I was being ripped apart. All I could do was cling to my husband and/or the side of the bed and sob my way through each contraction. Breathing was not an option. My husband was losing his mind trying to get them to just HELP ME. Finally I told them fuck my allergy, give me the stuff with the fentanyl in it and that worked. Sweet fucking relief, omg, I don't know what I would have done if they couldn't have gotten it to work. \n\nOnce I was nice and numb they checked me again and I was \"almost\" 10cm. Of *course* my epidural would wear off during the worst possible part of labor, right? Ugh. Anyway, they let me labor down on my own, drifting in and out, until 2am when I started feeling the urge to push. I was fully dilated and ready to go! I got the go-ahead to start pushing at 2:15 and they called my OB, who arrived pretty quickly. I'd originally planned on wanting to try different positions, but my legs were still totally dead and by that point I just didn't have any fucks left to give. Put me in the damn stirrups and let's meet this baby!\n\nI don't know how to describe the pushing. I could feel enough to know when it was time, which is great. It was like this wave that ran down my whole body, and I just rode the wave and tried to push it down and out with every ounce of strength I had. I remember chatting with my husband, OB, and nurse in between contractions/pushes but damn if I know what we talked about. And during each push, I was so incredibly focused on my job that a freaking truck could have hit me and I wouldn't have noticed. The whole world got reduced to just that wave and those muscles. Hubby said later that he was absolutely amazed with how strong and determined I was.\n\nI would get 3 or 4 contractions pretty close together, and then have a break of a few minutes. It was nice to be able to relax and catch my breath, though the pressure in my vag was incredibly weird and uncomfortable. The doc could see her head and I could feel her twitching as she came down. OB was massaging all around the vaginal opening with mineral oil, which I think made this all easier.\n\nAll told I pushed for almost 2 hours, but it didn't feel like nearly that long. The epidural was doing funny things so that by the end of it, I could move and feel my legs just fine but there was no pain in my vag at all. Just pressure. I gave one last enormous push, with everything I had, and the next thing I know my OB is telling me to open my eyes and look at my baby.\n\nI had this weird moment of \"wait, what, I specifically said I didn't want to watch the crowning\" and then they were plopping this screaming purple baby on my chest. This is another one of those things I just can't describe. Remember how the Grinch's heart grew three sizes? Mine did probably double that. I couldn't believe how cute and little and perfect and MINE she was. I still can't. I had no idea I was capable of loving anything this much.\n\nI had worried so much during pregnancy that I didn't feel too much of a connection to this baby growing inside me, but that all vanished the moment I saw her and held her. So mark it down: at 4:05 am on September 14, I fell in love with my baby. \n\nShe weighed 7lb 0.4oz and was 19.25\" long, with a head FULL of hair! Apgar scores were 9 and 9 - perfect baby! (But of course I knew that already)\n\nDH declined to cut the cord (it's really the only thing that has grossed him out in this whole process), and I was a little surprised when the OB asked if *I* wanted to do it. Sure, why the hell not! That was pretty cool!\n\nThe placenta plopped out with the next contraction and ew that was the weirdest feeling! I caught a little glimpse of it but it was pretty low on my list of priorities. I had 2 small tears, one on the bottom and one at about 7 o'clock, and my OB threw a couple of stitches in. My epidural was almost totally off by then, so I sort of felt them going in, but it was bearable. The post-birth uterine \"massage\" was worse. \n\nOh, and y'know how they say you won't notice if you poop while pushing? I totally noticed. I just pretended not to, and OB and the nurse said nothing. We will all take it to our graves.\n\n#After\n\nWe did skin to skin for close to 2 hours. DH had to leave the room at one point because he was so overcome with emotion he couldn't deal. It was honestly kind of adorable. We're both pretty private with our feelings, so it doesn't surprise me that we each had our own emotional surges separately. He went out for some air, I had a good sob of happy tears, and then we all just sort of snuggled and marveled at each other until the nurse came in to do baby's checks. \n\nI wasn't prepared for how hard that would be! My baby was only 5 feet away but it felt like miles and miles. I wanted to beg them to give her back to me, she's too far! She hasn't been out of direct physical contact with me *ever*! When she was back in my arms I cried with relief.\n\nThe rest of the hospital stay is kind of a blur. My biggest tip: STAY AS LONG AS THEY WILL LET YOU. We could have stayed another night but declined as it seemed like everything was going well. Then the first night home everything went to shit and we wound up rushing out to Target for bottles and formula and then back to L&D for some five alarm lactation consulting. I have never felt so guilty and helpless as I sat there trying to feed my screaming baby, every nerve in my body shrieking at me to feed her but my nipples so incredibly painful that I just couldn't make myself do it. I remember begging her not to hurt me, crying every bit as hard as her because she needed me so much and I couldn't do it. That's one of the worst moments of my life. If we'd stayed in the hospital that second night, maybe we wouldn't be having to re-teach her how to latch now.\n\nAnyway. This is massively long. I'll come back with more post-partum stuff when I'm further post-partum, but here's what I've got for now:\n\n* Keep notes during labor of what happens when. I wouldn't have remembered half this stuff if not for the notes we took. I'm going to tuck the paper in the  frame behind some baby photos, and probably this birth as well. \n\n* Post-partum hormones are no joke. I've cried nearly as much as my baby these last few days, both happy and sad tears. Just let it happen. You're not going crazy, I promise. If you're like me, those hormones may make you physically shake - I shook all through labor and the first 3 days PP. I still get them sometimes. I'm assuming things will return to normal at some point. \n\n* Stay in the hospital as long as they'll let you. There is no rush. Home will still be there tomorrow.\n\n* Fuck \"breast is best.\" FED IS BEST. I have felt so much guilt and shame over having to give my baby formula for a couple days when really all I'm doing is providing food for her any way I can and that's GREAT.\n\n* Every nurse and lactation consultant we've seen has had something different to say. It's all trial and error and highly individual. Forgive yourself if everything isn't perfect right away. BFing is skill that both you and baby will have to learn together.\n\n* Don't be afraid to ask for help. I called my mom in the middle of a panic attack and begged her to come up and help. She lives 600 miles away but was able to arrange things to be up here less than 24 hours later. Everything is going so much better now that there's an extra set of hands around. Just having her around is a great comfort to me. I'd wanted to tough it out with just me, DH, and baby, but that was just not in the cards for us.\n\n* Even if you are dead set on breastfeeding (like I was), have some bottles and a bit of formula on hand just in case. Emergency runs to Target when you have an infant screeching in hunger are NOT FUN. If you wind up not needing them, you can donate to a local women's shelter. We're using the [Playtex Drop-Ins with the newborn nipples](http://www.target.com/p/playtex-nurser-starter-3-pk-4-oz/-/A-10209185) on the recommendation of the IBCLC.\n\n* Blanket swaddling is for the birds. [Velcro swaddlers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01644OL78/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) all the way.\n\n* So. Much. Poop. OMG. You have no idea. Just know you may go through 3 or 4 diapers in 10 minutes because just when you think your baby is done, another fountain of poop comes out.\n\n* If you need to use bottles, check to make sure the nipples are all open and working! We couldn't figure out why she kept screaming and screaming for more food... until we realized the bottle was still completely full after an hour of feeding her. Blocked nipples are the worst!\n\nI feel like I have so much more to say and am forgetting everything but this is already so long and it's time to feed my baby soooo... if you really read all that, congratulations!

        "body": "Husband here! Wanted to note that when my wife said she thinks they upped the pitocin at 10pm, they did - they upped it from 1ml (or whatever) to 2. Basically doubled the dosage, though I'm not entirely sure exactly what the dosage level means. She didn't have a great reaction to it, baby's heartbeat started dipping a little bit (though nothing serious), so they lowered it back to 1. \n\nAlso, a bit of advice for men about to go through this:\n\n* The whole \"women are the weaker sex\" thing is bullshit. Men, you have NO idea what your partner is about to go through until you watch it. It's amazing how women can endure this marathon of pain and physical effort. \n* Early on, focus on taking care of your partner. She'll take care of the baby - just do whatever she needs to be comfortable. Now, I don't mean ignore the baby. I've changed her, swaddled her, bottle fed her, whatever. But I've let my wife take the lead - she figures out what she wants to do, and I take care of it when she needs a hand with a change or a feeding, or just needs food/water/a breather/whatever else. Recognize that your partner has just been through an incredibly difficult thing, both physically and emotionally, and do whatever she needs to support her through it. \n* Be prepared for your partner to go a little bit crazy. There are a ton of hormones being pumped through her, plus she's just had this exhausting delivery. Part of your job is to be the emotional rock for her to lean on - make sure she knows she's doing an amazing job. This shit is hard and your partner is likely going to need some reassurance along the way.\n\nAnd yes, fed is best. The whole \"breast is best\" thing may be true from a scientific point of view, but (at least at our hospital), my one complaint about everything was the huge focus on breastfeeding and neglect of any discussion about bottle feeding. Yes, breastfeeding is the healthiest option - but it isn't an option for all women, and it isn't an option right at the beginning for many others. I wish they had gone over bottle feeding and had educated us on other options, such as pumping into bottles while making a transition to breastfeeding. If your partner can't breastfeed 100% of the time right away, she may feel like she's failed somehow - you need to reassure her that she hasn't. Bottles are fine, formula is fine, and lactation consultants are amazing resources.",

    "body": "Pre-birth tips and (possible) tricks:\n\n*Eat Your Dates!!! I had five hours of active labor with thirty minutes of that being pushing. I am crediting the short labor to having eaten the prescribed amount of dates beforehand (70-75g/day starting at week 36). Study [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21280989).\n\n*Get a birth ball (exercise ball) and use it the weeks leading up to birth and during early labor! [Here](http://rootedforlife.wordpress.com/2013/09/14/im-birth-ball-crazy-ways-to-use-the-birth-ball-during-pregnancy-birth-and-after/) are the ways you can use the ball to move the baby into place for a faster labor.\n\n*Do whatever else you think might work... Evening Primrose Oil, Red raspberry leaf tea, exercise, sex. Can't say definitively if any or all of them worked, but I was happy with my outcome :)\n\n*Ask for hep-lock if you are required to have an IV. I didn't have an IV at all, but should you be in a hospital or have GBS for a birth center of homebirth, you'll have to have an IV. But if they give you a hep-lock, they can plug you up for fluids or antibiotics or anything, an then detatch you so you can move during labor without trailing an IV.\n\n\nThe Birth:\n\nI had my midwife appointment on Tuesday, December 16th at 11am (39+3weeks). I was in an absolutely terrible mood and was just over it (a sign that later the midwife said she uses to judge if it's time or not...I'm normally well put together and upbeat, but I came in in sweatpants and sobbing that day...There's your sign). She said she'd do a cervical check, but that if she did it'd probably put me into labor and was I \"prepared to have a baby today?\" Now, when someone asks you point blank \"today is the day. are you ready?\" There is a fleeting moment of the answer being \"No. We're not at all ready.\" And that's okay :) Cervical check done, we mosey home. \n\nPeriod-like cramps started around 12:30 and were a steady five to eight minutes apart by 1pm. Sat around all afternoon, cleaned a little, went to eat at the husband's parent's house, and were back home by 9pm. Around 11:30, shit started getting real. Those period cramps had engulfed my midsection and lower back and started radiating down my hips and thighs. I was on all fours swaying during conractions in the living room. We headed to the birth center at 12pm. By 12:30, they had dopplered the baby and measured all of my vitals. So far so good!\n\nAround 1:30, my husband suggested to use the ring sling as a hip squeeze. [Here](http://www.pregnancy.com.au/birth-choices/active-birth/rebozo-use-for-labour-the-hip-squeeze.shtml) is the video on how to do this! As soon as he cranked that piece of fabric around my hips, I heard a crack inside me (baby had basically realigned and fallen into my pelvis perfectly) and screamed for the midwife. The next contractions were WAY worse than the previous ones.\n\nBy this time, it feels like your hips and legs are just going to pop off your body. Literally. I would rather have had no legs at this point. But I had to keep moving during contractions. The midwife had me squatting, swaying, side lunging, and in the birth tub for the next two hours. I credit this for a faster labor too...keep moving that baby down! She then said I should start feeling the need to push, and I tried, but nothing was happening...\n\nSo she did a cervical check. DURING A CONTRACTION. Turns out my cervix had a lip that was preventing the baby from descending, so she \"moved\" that. Intense pain. I had not been crying until then, but that was really awful. \n\nThings happened quickly after that! Pushing, for those of you who haven't gone through it yet, is like having food poisioning times 100. Your body is in evacuation mode and there is nothing you can do but go with it. There is also a reason women poop on the table (hopefully, you'll clear out your system beforehand. I did. Pretty proud of not pooping the bed!) because birthing feels exactly like taking a massive poo. \n\nThe midwife made me relax during some of the last contractions so she could apply some olive oil to my perineum so I wouldn't tear/tear as badly. By this point I was on the bed on my knees leaning over a birth ball; not the most graceful of positions, but as comfortable as I could get. And then, the ring of fire for three pushes. There was a lot of screaming. And crying. And pleading with God to make it stop. The husband later said that he was terrified for me, but he kept looking at the midwives and they weren't worried. They were putting on their gloves and getting their stethyscopes ready, so he said he couldn't be too concerned if they weren't. And then she was out! Born 4:31am, 19.5 inchs, 7lbs.\n\nOver the next four hours, we layed in the bed with each other holding her while they checked her vitals. I delivered my placenta (think giant greased water balloon) and was stitched up (two minor tears). I had to have a good pee, eat a protein laden meal, and take a shower before I was allowed to go home. And since baby was perfect....\n\nWe left the birth center at 8:30am :)\n\nPost-birth tips:\n\n*Don't be a hero...use Depends. There is a lot of blood. And I know the mesh panties and pads work, but...Depends are amazing. \n\n*Make sure you are getting a good latch during breastfeeding! You should not have cracked or bleeding nipples if it is done correctly. [Here](http://unboundbirth.com/2012/05/breastfeeding-101-proper-latch/) is how you do it. Also, our little one had a tongue tie that was clipped before we left the birth center. Discuss with your provider what would be done for your little one should they have a lip or tongue tie.\n\n*Co-sleeping might be the only way you get sleep. I was severely anti-cosleeping, but after nearly a week of crying all night and switching out every two hours, I put her in bed beside me. We, on day ten days out, are sleeping from 10:30pm to 2:30am, and then from 2:30 until 7 or 8am. It's magic. Please read up on people who should not cosleep and how to cosleep safely. [Here](http://cosleeping.nd.edu/safe-co-sleeping-guidelines/) are some of those guidelines.\n\nThanks for reading and happy births!

    "body": "TLDR: Isabelle Rose, born 12/20/17 at 8:38 AM weighing 7lbs, 20 inches long after 13 hours of labor, 9 hours of which were without an epidural. Baby born after an hour of pushing.\n\nSo my last day of work before maternity leave was December 15th and I decided that I was going to try nearly every trick in the book to get this baby out before her due date of December 21st. Starting on the 15th I ate spicy food, bounced on the yoga ball, took long walks, had sex multiple times, used the breast pump, drank red raspberry leaf tea, took tons of evening primrose oil, and then finally ate castor oil.  I also had a stretch and sweep on December 18th, which may have helped. \n\nDH came home around 5 PM on December 19th and we ate dinner around 6:15 PM. At 7:15 PM I went to the bathroom, wiped, walked out, and then realized my water broke.\n\nSince this was my first baby and my water broke (GBS negative) the OB told me to come in. We were admitted around 8:30 PM, confirmed my water had been broken, and were shown to our room. The contractions were just starting and they were manageable, though not regular or timeable. They let me progress on my own with minimal cervical checks due to my water being broken. After my contractions started to really ramp up I requested pain medication and was given Nubane and Zofran at 1:15 AM on December 20th. The Nubane really took the edge off and I was able to micro nap between contractions, but it apparently really slowed down my contractions and made them weaker, so at 3:15 AM they told me they needed to start me on pitocin. I finally decided to get the epidural, but now I had to wait the hour for IV fluids. These contractions were no joke and I was practically screaming on my out breaths. DH felt so awful and was on the verge of tears seeing me in so much pain. At 4:13 AM they gave me the epidural and it was sweet relief. I slept until 7 AM when they checked me and noticed I was already crowning. I officially started pushing at 7:40 AM and my baby’s slippery body came out at 8:38 AM. She was 7 lbs 20 inches and pretty quiet upon arrival. I’m not sure what her Apgar scores were, but everyone said she looked great, so I wasn’t concerned. I ended up with a small 1st degree tear requiring stitches and a slight tear that didn’t require anything near my urethtra. \n\nOverall recovery has been much easier than I expected and I feel like my normal self for the most part. My stomach is pretty much back to normal despite my gnarly stretch marks. My milk started to come in the first night at the hospital and baby was cluster feeding like a fiend. We have not gotten a super successful latch yet, so my nipples are really painful, but I think it’s getting better. I still can’t believe I gave birth to a tiny human and that I get to keep her!\n\n[(Christmas) Baby tax](https://imgur.com/a/4mpPc)\n\n",

This goes for both oral and vaginal use. She said it isn't a problem, but that if you want an intervention free birth (as I do) that it is better to avoid taking it, as once your water has been broken for 24 hours you need to be given Pitocin if your baby hasn't been born yet. She said that the hospital transfer rates for women at the midwifery birthing centers were staggeringly higher for women taking EPO than those not, due to the early water breakage. \n\nShe told me I could keep taking them if I wanted, as it does help soften and dilate the cervix, but that she recommended against it if I wanted to do everything I could to avoid a hospital transfer. \n\nI figured I would pass along the info, as I wasn't able to find anything online or in any books about that. :)\n\nEdit: forgotted a words",

    "body": "I have been looking for a good sunscreen for YEARS now, spending hours lurking this subreddit, cosDNA, and the curology website for one that won't make me break out. I tried all of the popular ones on here, including (but not limited to): \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBiore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF 50+ / PA++++ (caused cc)\n\nBiore Perfect Face Milk SPF50 (caused cc)\n\nElta MD UV Clear Broad Spectrum SPF 46 (caused cc)\n\nShiseido Senka Mineral Water UV Gel (caused terrible cystic acne)\n\nLa Roche-Posay Anthelios 50 Mineral Ultra Light Sunscreen Fluid (caused cc)\n\nTizo Solar Protection Formula, Facial Mineral Fusion SPF 40 (my face hates silicones)\n\nBare Minerals Prep Step Mineral Shield SPF 50 (was discontinued for a while but it looks like it's back!) \n\nMurad City Skin Age Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 50 (expensive AF) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe closest I came to HG was the Bare Mineral Prep Step, but as a very fair individual, the tint was a bit too intense for my skin and I ended up looking quite orange. I found out quickly that chemical sunscreens seem to break me out. My acne is fungal and trying to find a FA safe product has been extremely challenging and frustrating.\n\n  \nIn one of my late night Amazon sessions, I somehow stumbled upon Endurance Shield High Performance Sunscreen SPF 45: [https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Sunscreen-SPF-Ounce/dp/B00B2SJL9K/ref=sr\\_1\\_3\\_a\\_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1544137555&sr=8-3&keywords=endurance+shield+sunscreen](https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Sunscreen-SPF-Ounce/dp/B00B2SJL9K/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1544137555&sr=8-3&keywords=endurance+shield+sunscreen)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are the ingredients: \n\nActive ingredients: Micronized zinc, 9%. Octyl methoxycinnamate, 1.5%\n\nInactive ingredients: Allantoin, aloe vera (certified organic), alpha bisabolol (chamomile), alpha lipoic acid, borage oil, cucumber extract, evening primrose oil, grape seed extract, hyaluronic acid, plantains, safflower seed, slippery elm, squalane, sunflower seed, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll admit I was a little bit skeptical about the vitamin E and octyl methoxycinnamate, but so far I haven't had any issues with it clogging my pores. I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and my acne has.... improved? My freckles and dark spots are fading and I finally feel okay about all of the actives I use since my skin is protected during the day. It is non-greasy, smells amazing, slightly moisturizing, and has NO WHITE CAST! It works well as a primer under makeup. \n\nI haven't seen it mentioned on this sub before, so wanted to give it a shoutout! ",

I was a virgin when I got married mostly because I have zero interest in sex and didn't want an unplanned pregnancy.\n\nIf we're being real, the first step is to put the brakes on having a baby until there's been a conversation where you directly say \"I'm pretty sure I'm asexual\".  You've told him you have a low libido, but having literally no interest in sex is a very different beast.  You and him need to be on the same page about that before having kids, else you run the risk of being another depressing story from r/DeadBedrooms in a few years.  Please please please do *not* have a baby until this discussion has happened *and* you have both agreed on a plan that meets *both* of your needs long term- your need to not have sex, and his (presumed) need to have passionate sex with a committed romantic partner.  I'm not going to say that a couple with one high-libido partner and one asexual partner can't be successful, but you need to figure out what the plan is for everyone's needs to be met before starting a family.\n\nIf this has already been discussed, with the word *asexual*, (not \"low libido\" but actually **asexual**) please disregard my post and go with the remaining excellent advice in this thread.",

What has helped us immensely is communicating before, during, and afterwards about how the experience is for each of us.\n\nThe other thing that has helped immensely is mixing in an at home insemination kit. I used it to successfully conceive my first LO. I find it helpful because it takes the pressure off of me to have penis in vagina sex if I'm not feeling up to it and works well with other things I may be interested in doing (manual stimulation, etc.). \n\nI've read from other ace folx here that using an OPK to narrow down when you may ovaluate is also helpful if you want to maximize chances from minimal amount of intercourse. I've never tried that myself personally but it may be helpful.\n\nOh I almost forgot, during my fertile week we have sex every second day. It usually works out to 3 or so times before I ovaluate.

Even orgasms were kinda... whatever... if I got that far. Couldn't feel much. No positive reinforcement lead to a general disinterest in it all. Being a virgin when I married, I didn't have any other experiences to compare. I thought maybe I was asexual. But honestly I think I've been largely disconnected from sexuality, I was repeatedly told sex was a chore and that it was boring from a young age. Regular therapy also helps.\n\nI don't like spontaneity. I find ttc more enjoyable if we focus on building emotional intimacy outside the bedroom. Also had to overhaul foreplay. Think crockpot, not light switch. I don't pretend to enjoy it if I'm not. I tell him, and we work on finding touch I like. And I'm not talking \"like\" as in it makes me feel whatever I think I should be feeling or experiencing, some imagined concept of feeling sexual, but \"like\" as in \"this is okay/relaxing\" and \"I can feel that and it doesn't hurt.\" Having a good laugh also helps. \n\nI saw a huge change in CM when I went on the pill just before getting married, ewcm disappeared.  After I came off BC it never returned to the way it was before. It's minimal. Who knows. \n\nSperm decreases in quality if there are long periods of abstaining. We aim for every 2-3 days after my period until day after ovulation. But some times it doesn't work out. Going on our 6th cycle. \n\nThis isn't advice, just experience.

But see if your partner is okay with you using a vibrator on your clitoris while he penetrates you. It helps bring more blood flow and stimulate the more sensitive area while he’s penetrating you (which also helps with blood flow and g spot stimulation). You can also request for him to do a bit of foreplay prior to penetration and then use the vibrator during. \n\nAlso, a tip I read on conception is to try and orgasm before he does. Orgasms help the vagina become more alkaline which allow more sperm to survive and the contractions from the orgasm help the sperm travel to fertilize the egg.\n\nPs - try looking into using Maca or vitex in your daily vitamin supplementation. As well as eating oysters, they’re high in zinc. It helps regulate hormones and bring up libido.",

After months and months of completely annovulatory cycles while trying to conceive our first child, getting that answer was as devastating as it was empowering. Yes, I knew something was wrong. But now I knew what it was.\n\nI dove head first into research, studying clinical trials and journal reviews, reading every blog post and article I could find. I experimented on my own body, becoming a walking, talking TTC lab – like many of you are. I know how it feels.\n\nWe were finally able to conceive our first using Clomid, Pre-seed, and a few of the things I'd learned.\n\nOur second was conceived naturally after 6 months of trying and only 2 annovulatory cycles in that time, because I applied more of what I learned.\n\nMy third pregnancy ended in a devastating late term miscarriage (15 weeks), but was something I never thought I'd experience - it had been a surprise. I had been using birth control.\n\nMy fourth pregnancy, our third child, came after just 3 months of trying with regular cycles, no assistance, and only a few PCOS symptoms.\n\nAfter he was born, I learned even more about PCOS and the long term impacts it can have on your body, and I started a specific dietary and supplement regimen for myself. I lost 50 lbs, my acne disappeared, my hormonal migraines were gone, my carb cravings vanished, and my anxiety lifted.\n\nThis complete change from when I was first diagnosed at 22, with terrible migraines, belly fat, uncontrollable carb cravings, acne, backne, hirtuism, and erratic, annovulatory cycles inspired me to go back to school and study nutrition. I received my certification as a nutrition coach in November, 2017, and got to work applying everything I learned from my certification to actually research the evidence and science behind the changes I had made and why they were successful. Hint: it is actually ridiculously cool to see some of the research behind the way *what we eat* impacts *how we feel*. It is still very much an emerging science, but a totally cool one!\n\nI've now taken everything I've learned - from almost 10 years of battling PCOS, 4 pregnancies, 3 children, endless experiments, thousands of hours of research, and university-level courses in nutrition, biology, and biochemistry - and turned it into a protocol that anyone can follow. I thought it might be fun to share it with you all so you can use it.\n\nHere it is:\n\n1. Check your fertility. Learn to track ovulation using your basal body temperature, OPKs, and other fertility indicators. Work with your medical team to eliminate secondary causes, such as endo, fibroids, or your partner's fertility.\n\n2. Stop restricting calories and listen to your body instead. Eat to 80% full at every meal, trying to have your bigger meal earlier in the day. Reduce or eliminate soy, wheat, dairy, and foods high in omega 6 fatty acids (this includes most processed foods.)\n\n3. Fill your diet with low-carb vegetables. Broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, green beans, spinach, zucchini, celery, kale, tomatoes, bell peppers, cabbage, cucumber, eggplant, avocado, onions, garlic, swiss chard, white mushrooms, iceberg lettuce, arugula, alfalfa sprouts, and more. Unlimited amounts of low-carb vegetables, balancing cruciferous vegetables with others to prevent thyroid issues. The fastest way to prepare these vegetables is to steam them and toss with the nourishing fat of your choice.\n\n4. Eat more fat. Specifically mono- and poly-unsaturated fats with an emphasis on plant-based sources such as coconut, avocado, and olive oil. If you choose to include dairy, limit it to 1-2 servings of full fat dairy per day - hormone free and organic if you can. The last thing a body with imbalanced hormones needs is another animal's artificial hormones!\n\n5. Eat moderate protein from healthy sources. Free range eggs, nuts, low carb legumes, and organic, pasture raised meat. It doesn't have to be expensive! Eat less of it. Fill your plate with those delicious vegetables and supplement your diet with small amounts of super healthy animal protein. If you feel you're not getting enough protein, add a minimally-processed dairy- and soy-free low-carb protein powder to your day.\n\n6. Supplement in a careful, targeted, evidence-based way. Take a prenatal with folate, add vitamin D, calcium, a slow-release B-100 complex (especially if taking metformin!), omega 3/fish oil supplement to reduce inflammation, Vitex, and use 1500mg evening primrose oil orally from cycle day 1 through day 14 to improve cervical mucus.\n\n7. Move your body! Specifically exercises that don't elevate cortisol levels higher than needed for longer than needed are optimal. Strength training is a fantastic tool, but the most important thing to do is to find something you love and can do consistently. Even though it elevates cortisol for extended periods, I love long distance running and do it consistently - which helps my insulin sensitivity. I add strength training to help me meet my running goals and prevent too much adaptation to my running training, which would reduce the effectiveness.\n\n8. Practice self-care. Get a support network, like this one. Sleep 7-9 hours each night at a minimum to reduce cortisol levels. Find a way to relieve stress. Add hobbies outside of TTC so it doesn't consume you. Professional supports exist to help you do these things and give the kind of daily support and attention your OB/GYN, RE, or MD don't have the time and resources to provide - use them if you need it. That's what they're there for.\n\nThat's it. That's everything I did to improve my fertility and almost entirely eliminate my PCOS symptoms. I can cite research articles from pubmed for just about everything in this list and will happily do so if needed! Please - ask me anything. I want to help you get that BFP! You deserve it.\n\nKnow that you don't have to do *everything* on this list. Just a few things will be enough to get you on your way. You can also add other things to this, like Maca or spearmint or whatever else you want to try.\n\nAlso feel free to ask me anything else if you want to get to know me. I’ve been reading through many of your posts and you all seem like we could be friends IRL! <3",

    "body": "*This is my first ever post on this sub. I'm mostly a reddit lurker and definitely a posting noob and will likely need to reformat. This sub has been incredibly helpful through my acne struggle. I know there is at least one person out there who is where I was a few months ago: at rock bottom with hormonal acne, desperate, insane, and broken.*  \n\n**Skin Type**: Combination. Born with oily skin, but Accutane made me dry. Now I'm a bit of both. Also, I'm a few shades darker than translucent, which really emphasizes the redness acne.  \n\n**Acne Type**: Cystic and hormonal. Since about age 18 it's been hormonal and only on my chin/jawline. My breakouts were painful, deep whiteheads and cysts that would take 1+ week to heal and always left PIH and PIE.  \n\n**Lady Parts Type**: I'm 99% sure I have undiagnosed PCOS. I've been to many doctors, none of whom have diagnosed me with PCOS because I'm not overweight and don't have insulin resistance. However, for my entire post-puberty life, I have had painful, heavy, long, nasty periods. My cramps were so bad I struggled to move. I often wrapped portable heating pads around my abdomen to go to school and work. Also, for most of my 20s, I've had painful ovulations that are likely due to ovarian cysts. Doctors would tell me just to deal with it. I have tried all the treatments for PCOS anyway (see below), so a diagnosis would not have likely changed this.  \n\n**History**: I've had acne for over 20 years. Not just some mild acne, but massive, painful cysts and whiteheads. I started getting cysts when I was 8 and I'm now 28. I have tried basically every prescription and non-prescription treatment known to (wo)man. I've spent thousands of dollars on products, weeks at a time hiding in my house, and years miserable with depression. Here are the highlights:  \n\n**Prescription Medications**  \n  * Accutane (3 rounds at ages 11, 12, and 21): First two rounds cleared me until age 17. Third round only worked while I was taking it, as my acne was hormonal (chin/jawline).  \n  * Spironolactone: Temporarily cured my hormonal acne for ~ 2 years. Eventually worked my way up from 50mg/daily to 200mg/daily while still getting huge, painful outbreaks.  \n  * Estrogen-based BC pills: Temporarily cured my hormonal acne for ~ 5 months until I had to stop taking due to migraines. Also made my cycles more bearable.  \n  * Mirena: Made me grow facial hair. Yep. Mild acne improvements.  \n  * Paraguard: Made me bleed non-stop. No effect on acne.  \n  * Nuvaring: Mild acne improvement. Did this for ~ 5 years not knowing it was giving me migraines. Stopped when my periods got bad again.  \n  * Antibiotics: Mild and temporary acne improvement.  \n\n**Prescription Topicals**  \n  * Differin, Aczone, Clindamycin, Epiduo, Tazorac, Azelaic acid: Nothing  \n  * Clindamycin and sulfacetamide (wash): Nothing  \n  * Tretinoin: Cleared my acne, but my skin was permanently bright red and peeling, which was as equally bad as the acne. If I applied it every other day, the redness would fade and acne would come back.  \n\n**OTC Topicals**  \n  * Benzoyl peroxide: Nothing  \n  * Salicylic acid: Nothing  \n  * Glycolic, lactic, and malic acids: Improved skin texture, but didn't help acne.  \n  * Sulphur: Nothing  \n  * Tea Tree oil: Nothing  \n  * Neem oil: Nothing  \n  * Other OCM oils (tried em all): Nothing  \n  * Niacinamide: Nothing  \n  * Snail essence: Nothing  \n  * Clay masks: Helped with blackheads, no effect on acne  \n \n**Supplements**  \n  * Vitamins (A, Bs, C, D, E, multis): Nothing  \n  * Minerals (Calcium, Chromium, Selenium, Zinc, and many more): Nothing  \n  * Estroblock: Nothing  \n  * DIM: Nothing  \n  * Evening Primrose Oil: Nothing  \n  * Green Tea Extract: Nothing  \n  * Myo-inositol: Nothing  \n  * Omega 3s: Nothing  \n  * Cod Liver Oil: Nothing  \n  * Spearmint Tea (capsules): Nothing  \n  * Saw Palmetto: Nothing  \n  * NAC: Nothing  \n  * Turmeric: Nothing  \n\n**Misc**  \n  * Blue Light Therapy (at a derm clinic and at home): Nothing  \n  * Acid peels (at a derm): Lots of skin redness and peeling, minimal acne improvement.  \n  * Spearmint and green tea (beverage): Nothing  \n  * Progesterone cream: Nothing  \n  * Exercise: Nothing  \n  * Changing pillowcases/sheets: Nothing  \n  * Not washing my face: WORSE  \n  * Antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications (prescribed for other reasons): Nothing  \n  * Drinking lots of water: Nothing  \n  * Therapy: Nothing  \n\nI have likely forgotten things I have tried over the past 20 years. Needless to say, I tried anything and everything that might have helped.  \n\n**So how did I fix it?** Diet. Not the diet you're thinking of. I had already eliminated all the usual suspects. I haven't eaten dairy since I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease at age 12. I have also tried going vegetarian, gluten free, and added sugar free (was still eating fruit, veggies, and grains), all to no avail. Then three months ago I went keto and shunned all carbs. I went from eating TONS of fruit, vegetables, and whole grains to a high fat, medium protein, and low carb diet. Haven't had a single breakout. I've had some tiny bumps along my jaw that are skin colored and not even noticeable. That's about it. I've also stopped having painful ovulations and periods. The best part? I've stopped wearing makeup, stopped hiding in my house, lost some belly fat, and REGAINED MY SANITY. I take no medications or supplements for acne and have a basic and reasonable skincare routine that doesn't take hours to layer on in the morning and at night.  \n\n**What do I eat now?**    \n   Mostly: Nuts (almond, macadamia, pistachio), nut butters, nut milk, salmon, eggs, chicken, avocados, spinach, zucchini, cauliflower, hummus, olive oil, and quest bars (I unfortunately still love dessert).  \n   Moderately: Broccoli, bell peppers, berries, grass-fed butter, shrimp and other seafood. I also make my own stevia-sweetened chocolate bars for dessert.  \n   Rarely: Beef, bacon, and sausage. Processed meats aren't good for you, despite what r/keto says.  \n   Never: Most fruits, high carb veggies, grains (not even the \"healthy\" ones), all the desserts I used to love.  \n\nI have a pretty bad sugar addiction, so I keep the stevia products limited. Watch out for other artificial sweeteners like Malitol, because that shit will give you the shits and some people find throws them out of ketosis.  \n\nLots of people tell me they could never give up [insert carb here], and I can honestly say I'll never go back. Once I got over the initial hump, it was pretty easy. A few weeks in, I thought I would eat oatmeal (one of my former daily snacks) as my carbs for the day and instantly regretted it. I felt like my guts were going to explode. Not. Worth. It. Also, the world is full of hidden carbs, so I have constant vigilance when I'm eating out. A price I am definitely willing to pay to have clear skin.  \n\nI really hope this will be helpful to someone out there who has tried everything with no results. If you have questions, please send me a message!",

    "body": "My LO and husband are currently asleep doing skin to skin and I'm laying here in shock over the whole experience. Baby girl L was born yesterday (11/19) at 39+1., weighing 7 lbs and 15 oz, 20 inches long. \n\nTL;DR - birth center birth almost turned hospital birth. [baby tax ](https://imgur.com/a/wnFXK) \n\nBackground: I ran throughout my pregnancy up until 33 weeks. Then I walked 3-5 miles a day up until 38 weeks. About a week ago I started drinking red raspberry leaf tea and inserting an evening primrose oil tablet vaginally before bed at night, per instruction of my midwife. Saturday (11/18), I upped it to two pills. Had sex with my husband Saturday night as well. I only gained 13 lbs and tried to be as healthy and active as I could. I say all of this because I was determined to do what I could to have a quick and easy (HAHA) unmedicated labor. \n\nContractions started Sunday (11/19) early morning around 2:30am. I didn't time them and just sat in the bath from about 4 to when my husband woke up around 6. I was losing my mucous plug and having my bloody show.  When my husband woke up he initially freaked out that I hadn't woken him up immediately. He called my mom and she got over around 9am (she stayed at our house with the dogs and fixed us a bunch of freezer food while she hung out ... best mom ever. 💜). They were both urging me to come to the birth center. Contractions were 5-8 min apart when I was laying down on my side (what I preferred) and 3-4 min when I got up to use the bathroom. I mainly just laid in bed and watched tv, focusing on keeping my hands as loose as possible during each contraction (loose hands = loose body). The hardest part was keeping my husband distracted, he was so nervous. My mom gave me a pedicure and we sent him to Bojangles for biscuits. \n\nFinally around noon we agreed with the midwife to come in for a check around 2:30. Got here after a car ride where my husband drove with the flashers on (unnecessary lol) and about 10 miles over the speed limit. Contractions were still very manageable and I could talk through them for the most part. \n\nThe midwife checked and I was 5cm dilated and fully effaced so I got to stay! Got set up in a birthing room and our doula arrived about 10 minutes later. All together throughout the birth we had a doula, 2 midwives, and a student midwife. \n\nContractions were still manageable at this point. I thought I'd utilize the tub but all I wanted to do was keeping laying on my side in bed. I hadn't slept more than 12 hours over the past 3 days (thanks pregnancy insomnia) and was already tired. My husband played his guitar for me and I breathed through the contractions and made small talk with our doula.\n\nAfter a few hours, the contractions started getting closer and stronger so the midwife suggested I start the nitrous soon if I wanted it. I did and this was my biggest reason now for not getting in the tub - I couldn't use the nitrous in there. \n\nStudent midwife checked and I was 7 cm with bulging waters. Midwife recommended breaking them so I could progress quicker. This was around 6pm I think? It didn't hurt at all but felt so weird - really hot gush of liquid all at once. \n\nContractions ramped up after they broke my water and soon I was 8 cm dilated and in transition. I felt soooo much pressure in my butt and like I needed to push but it was too soon. The nitrous helped I think. It definitely made me high-ish and I started to not care about the sounds I was making. I felt like an animal - I was moaning sooo loud... or at least it felt like it. The downside of the nitrous was that it broke my focus/concentration. All along, my strategy had been to really concentrate on each contraction and on the pain and on keeping every muscle in my body loose. The nitrous broke my concentration and made coping so, so much harder. I'm not sure I'd use it again, tbh. Inhaling/exhaling in the mask became my new focus. \n\nThe midwives and doula  had me switch sides a few times with the peanut ball, get on my hands and knees (not comfortable for me), and sit on the toilet. The urge to push became so much stronger and I was almost in tears because I just wanted to give up. But I knew I wouldn't be able to transfer to the hospital with the amount of pain I was in and I felt so stuck. My doula and the the student midwife were awesome... they were encouraging and helpful. They both stayed by my side and physically supported me and held me up while I labored. My husband stood in front of me for the most part and held my free hand (other hand was clutching the nitrous mask for dear life). \n\nThey had me move back to the bed when I said that it felt like my body was pushing on its own. They checked and I was at a 10 with a slight lip. The student midwife pushed it out of the way during the next contraction and then I was ready to push! It took me a while to get the hang of pushing - I wanted to keep yelling and moaning but they coached me on grunting and pushing like I was having a bowel movement. They took away the nitrous so I could focus, which scared me at first because breathing in the mask had been my coping mechanism for the past 2 hours. Pushing was so hard for me - it felt like I was literally pushing my butthole inside out and I was terrified. \n\nThey suggested I use the squat bars, so I did and I'm pretty sure I pooped. Using the squat bars wasn't comfortable for me; my legs were so shaky and tired! During this time, baby's heart rate started dropping so they wanted me back in bed. I tried hands and knees but her heart rate continued to drop. They had me lay back on my side with my legs propped open. It was sooo hard because all I wanted to do was curl into a ball. I felt like I was pushing so, so hard and not getting anywhere and I could see them start to get concerned. The midwife mentioned an episiotomy and I freaked out. Baby's heart rate continued to go down and they told me at one point it hit the 60s! They gave me oxygen at this point.\n\nI couldn't see what was happening (and I didn't want to look), but they kept saying that they could see her head and my husband said she had hair! I'd push so hard and almost have her head out, but then she would slip back in. The student midwife was rubbing olive oil on my perinium and trying to manually stretch it to help.  Later my husband told me that she basically dumped half a bottle of olive oil in the birth canal. They said if I didn't get her out in two pushes we'd have to transfer to the hospital. I was crazy at this point. It was all so intense and painful and I couldn't imagine being conscious and going to the hospital. They'd literally have to knock me out to get me to move, I was so scared. On the next push everyone was yelling at me to give it all I had. The midwife stuck her finger IN MY BUTT to push down and give baby room to come through. I screamed and feel like I lost my memory because the next thing I know, she was out on the next push. Her cord was super short and she could barely reach my belly button for skin to skin. She also has really wide shoulders, so those two things were causing her to get stuck and in distress. I am SO GLAD I was able to get her out. \n\nShe was born after 2 hours in transition and 1 hour of pushing. I had 2 tiny tears up top that only needed one stitch each. I felt like I had torn all of the way to my butt but nope. The midwives really helped to ensure that wouldn't happen. And I couldn't have done it without our doula. She was amazing and a rock for my husband and me. \n\nThey helped me get her to latch and my doula left to get us Cookout, my celebration meal! The postpartum fundal massages hurt like a bitch and that's the only time during the whole experience that I dropped the f bomb. Lol. I used the nitrous for that and the stitches. Bleeding has seemed profuse but the assured me it was actually way less than they'd seen before.  I took a shower about 3 hours after having her and it felt so amazing to just sit under the hot water and know that it was all over. I remember saying over and over again during transition that I just wanted this to end and they assured me it would--- and it did! Contractions literally stopped as soon as she was out and I barely felt the placenta. And I checked in the shower - my butthole did not prolapse like I'd feared it had. Lol. It has taken me about 3 hours to stop shaking profusely too. They said it's normal, all of the adrenaline, especially from the scary experience at the end. \n\nShe's currently doing skin to skin with my husband and they're both passed out. [and she has my lips and dark hair! ](https://imgur.com/a/wnFXK)\n\nI should be sleeping, I haven't slept in almost 24 hours now and barely have slept since Thursday. But I'm just so amazed with her and the fact that I actually did it. Transition and pushing is NO JOKE! I thought I was going to just give up but the thought of having to move made me realize I couldn't. Which made me panic, but with my incredible support -husband, doula, and midwives, I did it!! ",

    "body": "Hey everyone -- there's a lot of detail below, but it's organized as favorite to least favorite. And [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionLux/comments/102f0zu/i_spent_2k_on_skincare_so_you_dont_have_to/)'s a link to my last post, where I speak to some of the products that I skip mentioning here.\n\n**Product reviews**\n\n* **iS Clinical Active Serum 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is my HG exfoliant. It's the perfect strength for my skin. p50 was perfect before I started using retinoids (although I never tried the lower strengths), but this formula is the perfect formula to purify my oily T-zone while not causing irritation on dry-tending cheeks.\n   * *Cost:* $88 for 15mL\n   * *How I use it:* Either in the AM or PM, every other day (alternating with a retinoid). I use 5 drops on face and neck, applied with my hands on dry skin.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Lots of common suspects: glycerin, butylene glycol, alcohol denat., phenoxyethanol. None of these are terrible worth going into, although super sensitive folks may have trouble with the alcohol denat.\n      * Arbutin: skin-lightening ingredient that [works differently](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8632348/) than Vit C or licorice, so their effects can be complementary.\n      * Salix Alba (willow) bark extract: natural source of salicylic acid.\n      * Saccharum Officinarum Extract: natural source of glycolic acid.\n      * Bilberry extract: blueberry-like fruit with soothing and anti-aging properties. It's a [strong antioxidant](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-vaccinium-myrtillus-fruit-extract.html) due to the anthocyanins in the fruit (which give the skin its dark blue color).\n      * Polyporus Umbellatus Extract: source of kojic acid, which has skin brightening properties. It is also antimicrobial, according to the iS Clinical [website](https://isclinical.com/ingredient/view/index/id/5778).\n      * Menthol: this one is controversial. It's listed as an irritant, and I certainly don't want to dispute that. I also know that menthol is used in a wide variety of formulas (e.g., IcyHot), so I think it's worth trying and maybe backing off if you have trouble. \n* **Tata Harper Superkind Softening Cleanser 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* It feels like washing your face with floral honey, and it really does calm the skin. A 100% RP.\n   * *Cost:* $88 for 125mL\n   * *How I use it:* Everyday once (try to minimize since it's pricey). In the shower and rinse. Sometimes on dry skin.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * A powerful suite of emollients (which I'm OK with as an oily-combo skin type since it's a cream cleanser): evening primrose oil, apple seed oil, castor oil, jojoba seed oil, squalane, grape seed oil, and sunflower oil. Note these are all mid-low comedogenicity.\n      * Lactic acid serves as a very gentle exfoliant, although % is not listed.\n      * Olivem 1000, which is a combo of ingredients used to emulsify the formula. However, Olivem 1000 puts the products into a liquid crystal structure, which is supposed to absorb into the skin with increased efficacy. *To look for Olivem 1000 in a product, look for Sorbitan Olivate and Cetearyl Olivate.*\n      * Soothers in this formula are abundant (hence \"Superkind\"): prickly pear, calendula (#1 ingredient), and chamomile are the stars.\n      * Magnolia extract is another ingredient worth mentioning in this formula: it's a popular addition [for Nivea](https://www.nivea.com.au/advice/skin/magnolia-extract) as well. It has antioxidant, antimicrobial, and softening effects.\n      * There are a number of natural surfactants (it is a cleanser after all): decyl glucoside, and shea butter glycerides as the primary ones.\n      * As for all of Tata Harper's products (that I know of): there is fragrance. If you're super sensitive, proceed with caution.\n* **Tata Harper Regenerating Cleanser 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a physical/chemical exfoliant mix and is loaded with natural goodies in classic Tata fashion. It works well with the resurfacing mask, and is an effective formula for increased shine and deeper subsequent product penetration.\n   * *Cost:* $88 for 120mL\n   * *How I use it:* Twice a week, once with the resurfacing mask (see below for details).\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * This is a physical/chemical exfoliant mix: physical exfoliants include kaolin clay, apricot seed powder, and rice extract. These are quite small and I have found to be pleasant as a compounding abrasive agent. For chemical exfoliants, we have Salix Alba extract and pomegranate enzyme.\n      * Some more under the radar ingredients: Olivem 1000, radish root extract, superoxide dismutase, which is an effective antioxidant for protecting against reactive oxygen species (ROS). \n      * Aloe juice is near the top of the list and is soothing (as we know).\n      * Plenty of other good emollients in this formula as well (sunflower seed oil, olive oil). \n      * Lots of powerful fruit extracts in here, too (classic Tata): elderberry extract, alfalfa, and meadowsweet are the major ones. These are mostly antioxidant and antimicrobial actors in the formula.\n      * There are a few potential irritants in this formula, so maybe try the small size first to see if it agrees with your skin.\n* **Obagi Professional-C Serum 10% 5/5** There are only 5 ingredients in this formula, with AA as one of them. It's a good alternative for me vs. SC CE Ferulic since it's less comedogenic. It will oxidize quickly (as I've heard) so I usually keep this in the fridge. Retro-fitting a pump (vs. dropper) is a good idea, too. It smells good, too. It's $94 for 1oz. I use it after cleansing in the AM.\n* **EltaMD UV Clear Broad Spectrum SPF 46 5/5** Enough has been written about this brand and formula, so I'm not going to dive deep here. That said, it's physical/chemical and broad spectrum, has niacinamide, lactic acid, and is oil-free. It's a great option for sensitive, acne-prone skin. The tint was too obvious for my skin, so I prefer the clear version.\n* **Tata Harper Clarifying Moisturizer 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* If you have very oily skin, I would maybe avoid this formula. There are a number of somewhat comedogenic oils, but it may still be worth a try as comedogenicity is not always 1:1. It's a gorgeous formula and truly unique. My skin is oily-combo, and it works (and smells) like a charm. 100% RP.\n   * *Cost:* $130 for 1.7 fl oz.\n   * *How I use it:* I absolutely love this moisturizer. I use it everyday during my morning routine.\n   * *Ingredients:* Same idea as the mask. I can't speak to everything in this…you'd have to be a cosmetic botanist to do that…\n      * A number of interesting oils in this formula which tend to not be comedogenic: sandalwood oil, squalane, apple seed oil, evening primrose oil, sea buckthorn oil. Sandalwood oil is high in Ximenynic acid, [which is a potent anti-inflammatory agent](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/Detail/1777/556915/Pure-Australian-Sandalwood-Seed-Oil). Evening primrose has a lot of [antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects as well](https://www.byrdie.com/evening-primrose-oil-for-skin-5215964), although it falls in the middle of the comedogenicity rating. Sea Buckthorn oil is also an-\"it\" oil recently. It's also high in antioxidants incl. vit C., regulates sebum production, has antimicrobial properties, and obviously moisturizes ([source](https://www.byrdie.com/sea-buckthorn-oil-5210082)). Since this is a formula for blemish-prone skin, the formula is sebum-conscious. That said, if you have very oily skin, I would test before committing to the full bottle.\n      * Lots of soothing agents in here: Aloe, calendula, lactobacillus ferment, arnica, multiple types of HA, tremella extract (mushroom with outstanding humectant properties).\n      * The antioxidants in this formula are powerful (including the oils mentioned above): borage leaf extract, Tasmanian pepper extract, fermented bamboo, sea fern extract. \n      * As far as anti-acne agents, Zinc + Salix Alba bark extract are the main factors. \n      * There's also Alpha-Glucan oligosaccharide, which is [supposed to be](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/eu/PersonalCare/Detail/2510/74697/BioEcolia) beneficial for the skin microbiome.\n* **SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Gel:** **5/5**\n   * *Summary:* So this serum is a go-to for me as someone with combination skin that tends toward redness. A 100% RP. 5/5.\n   * *Cost:* $78 for 30mL\n   * *How I use it:* The serum is something I put up to augment any active I use, and I love it for that reason. It’s hydrating, calming, and smells good, and it ultimately is the most frequently used product in my routine. \n   * *Ingredients:* There are a number of interesting ingredients in this formula: \n      * Olea Europaea Leaf Extract is olive leaf extract, and it’s shown some promise in [this](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32333467/) study (although it’s a small group, not double blind or randomized, and technically doesn’t meet statistical significance thresholds). That said, PC has [great things to say](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredients/ingredient-olea-europaea-leaf-extract.html). Major benefits are improvement in skin texture, some photoprotection, and antioxidant properties (high in catechin and rutin, both bioflavonoids). \n      * There’s also cucumber fruit extract, which has moisturizing (no surprise, it’s 95% water), antioxidant (some Ascorbic Acid, some flavonoids), and conditioning properties. Cucumber is one of the rare instances of a non-sensitizing fragrance. \n      * This formula also has grapefruit extract and thyme extract — consensus from outside SkinCeuticals seems light to mid on both of these. \n      * The formula has a small amount of Morus Bombycis Root Extract, which is derived from mulberry and has arbutin in it, which as we know is good for skin lightening as it’s a hydroquinone derivative. \n      * There are a few icks in this formula (fragrance, linalool, etc.), but overall I have found it to be very calming and pleasant. \n* **Dr. Jart+ Cicapair Tiger Grass Sleepair Intensive Mask 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a thick, non-comedogenic formula with intense soothing effects. It will likely pill, but it's intended for night use, so that shouldn't be an issue. I prefer this to the SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Masque. Will RP.\n   * *Cost:* $42 for 110mL\n   * *How I use it:* I only use this for irritated skin, which it promptly resolves over night.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * As far as moisturizing factors, this product has over ten humectants: propanediol, glycerin, trehalose being the highest on the ingredient list\n      * There are a smaller number of emollients: only true oil being moringa seed oil, which is far down the ingredient list. Point being: *this product is thick but has not been comedogenic in my experience.*\n      * The real power of this product is in the soothing ingredients it offers: gotu kola (cica) being the featured #1. Gotu Kola contains a number of active compounds, including madecassoside, which has been shown to work as a [wound-healing agent](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18503551/), an [anti-hyperpigmentation agent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6290557/), and a soothing ingredient [potentially effective](https://www.seppic.com/en/clean-moisture-lotion-as40140a) for atopic dermatitis (eczema). There are more soothing agents in this formula—without listing them all, suffice it say that Dr. Jart+'s chemists know what they're doing.\n      * There is also Niacinamide, Curcumin extract, Adenosine, Cacao seed extract, and other antioxidant ingredients for a nourishing blend.\n* **CeraVe SA Cream for Rough and Bumpy Skin 5/5** \n   * Summary: It's a standard (not lux) product which is effective for KP. It works.\n   * Cost:\n   * How I use it: I use it on the body (esp. on the thighs). 2x/day.\n   * Ingredients:\n      * It's a thick formula (lots of ceramides, corn oil, paraffin, mineral oil, cholesterol), but it's interestingly not comedogenic (also because it's indicated for body use vs. face). \n      * In terms of actives, we have lactate, vit E, salicylic acid, niacinamide, and phytosphingosine.\n* **SkinMedica TNS Advanced+ Serum 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* A multi-tasking superformula with growth factors derived from human fibroblasts. It's very expensive, and it's something that I don't think I will repurchase (not because it doesn't work) but because anti-aging isn't my #1 priority. While my skin is young, I'm focused on anti-acne and hyperpigmentation, but for folks who want to improve collagen and elastin production, this is it.\n   * *Cost:* $295 for 1oz.\n   * *How I use it:* After microneedling at home, once or twice a week. \n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * TNS (total nutrient system): this is a medium that is harvested from propagated human fibroblasts. This medium is rich in nutrients and signaling compounds that trigger collagen and elastin production.\n      * Lots of other goodies: peptide complexes such as whey, lactococcus ferment, algae extract, usual suspects for humectants, fruit extracts such as apple and grape, pullulan, lecithin (for creating liposomes which deliver actives deeper into the skin).\n* **SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel: 5/5 — with caution**\n   * *Summary:* This is a strong cleanser and should only be used for folks with oily skin. It has a cooling effect, which is pleasant, but the combination of actives in this is no joke. If you have really congested, clogged pores, I would recommend it. It's cheap enough, and strong enough, that I only need a bit and can use it as a semi-regular purge. It's an RP for me.\n   * *Cost:* $42 for 240mL\n   * *How I use it:* I usually only use it in my T-zone, leave it on for no more than 3 minutes and rinse.\n   * *Ingredients:* \n      * Sodium Laureth Sulfate: Chief Bubble Officer. [Less irritating](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12641575/) than Sodium *Lauryl* Sulfate.\n      * Glycolic acid: most researched and effective AHA. We know this sloughs off the top layer of dead skin cells. \n      * Salicylic acid (SA): an HG for acne treatment. Is lipid soluble so it can penetrate more deeply into the sebaceous gland and provide a better decongesting effect. This is in addition to exfoliating properties acting at the skin surface (although inferior to glycolic in that respect).\n      * Capryolyl Salicylic acid (LHA): this is a compound developed by L'Oreal to be a more lipophilic version of SA, providing better penetration. The study is from 2007 and 100% sponsored by L'Oreal but you can read it [here](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(06)03022-2/fulltext) if you're interested. There is some hubbub about pregnancy safety; do your own research on that front if that's applicable to you.\n      * Menthol: provides a nice cooling but can be sensitizing. [PC](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-menthol.html) is pretty adamant against it, but I don't really give it too much stead. They cite pretty old research. I don't think my skin has been sensitized from it. There is [some newer evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8620938/) of it promoting wound healing.\n      * [Sorbitol](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-sorbitol.html): A sugar substitute that acts as a humectant. Interestingly, it can also act as a prebiotic. Certain bacteria on your skin can convert sorbitol into beta-glucan, which calms the skin. Beta-glucan is partially responsible for the calming effect of oats and seaweed\n* **PCA Clearskin Lightweight Moisturizer:** **4/5**\n   * *Summary:* Overall, I find this product to be hydrating and non-offensive. To be honest, I don't know that it surpasses my OG in this category (non-comedogenic moisturizer) which is Neutrogena HydroBoost Water Gel. Although, if you need something more emollient than that, this is a very good option.\n   * *Cost:* $57 for 1.7oz\n   * *How I use it:* This is a good option for night time for those with oily skin. It might be too thick to put under an occlusive sunscreen during the day esp. if you run oily. Otherwise, daytime fine, too.\n   * *Ingredients:* \n      * Ethylhexyl Isononanoate (say that 5 times fast) is the primary emollient here, and to be honest I can’t find much in the way of research on this compound. That said, I really trust PCA because your ingredients must really be top notch if you’re going to have the most bland packaging known to man. Murad and EltaMD also seem to be fans of it, which is a good sign. There are a number of other emollients, preservatives, and viscosity controlling agents which are probably not worth mentioning (they're pretty inert as far as those go). \n      * Borage seed oil has a comedogenicity rating of 2 (out of 5, 5 being instant pimple) and is very high in GLA (gamma linolenic acid) which [PC](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-gamma-linolenic-acid-gla.html) considers to be a \"best\" rating. There is some good consensus that it has skin regulating properties (eczema, seborrheic dermatitis, etc.). \n      * Other calming ingredients: aloe, calendula, cucumber, chamomile (bisabolol). Has glycerin as well (although not too much). \n      * There is retinyl palmitate, which is a bit confusing to me, to be honest. If you're making a moisturizer for oily skin, I don't know why you would include one of the least active forms of vitamin A. \n* **SkinMedica HA5 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* I think this is probably a miracle product if you have deep wrinkles. The five different types of HA are going to sit on various levels of the dermis, provide different hydration profiles, and sustain moisture in different ways. For me, as a younger person without deep wrinkles, it's nice but not worth the $ for me right now.\n   * *Cost:* $184 for 2oz\n   * *How I use it:* Usually replaces a proper (?) moisturizer during daytime for me and put sunscreen on over.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * 5 types of HA. I'm not going to go through them, but there is crosslinked (bigger HA, which sits on top of skin cuz there's no way it's penetrating any deeper), hydrolyzed (smaller version but SkinMedica doesn't give the weight so hard to say exactly where it's going to land in the skin), plus the regular HA. I actually see 3 obvious HAs in the ingredients, not 5. Someone help.\n      * Texturizing compounds (HDI/Trimethylol Hexyllactone Cross-p, polymethylsilsesquioxane) which give it a really nice slip feel\n      * Pullulan (mentioned this [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionLux/comments/102f0zu/i_spent_2k_on_skincare_so_you_dont_have_to/)) but this is the compound that tightens the skin and is used to create the Listerine sheets.\n      * Vitis Vinifera Seed Extract (grape seed), which [PC loves](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-vitis-vinifera-grape-seed-extract.html). It's antioxidant containing and many of them at that (resveratrol, anthocyanins, flavonoids, etc.)\n      * Vibrio alginolyticus ferment filtrate: This is actually a pathogenic Gram-negative bacterium, but this is obviously not a live form of it. Hard to find a lot of info on it, but[ it seems like](https://trulux.com.au/products/vibrio-alginolyticus-ferment-filtrate#:~:text=Vibrio%20Alginolyticus%20Ferment%20Filtrate)%20organizes,exopolysaccharide%20synthesized%20by%20kopara%20microorganisms.) it claims to be helpful in epidermal organization. \n      * Porphyridium cruentum extract which is a red algae derivative that has zeaxanthin, which is in the vitamin A family and has photoprotective properties. Jury seems to be out on efficacy.\n      * Moisturizing factors: Serine, Urea, Trehalose. Urea is interesting because it does have a function in rejuvenation (by breaking down a protein called filaggrin which helps organize the keratin in the skin at the top layer). This is thought to free up amino acids in the ECM.\n      * Skin communication ingredients: Whey protein, Plankton extract\n* **Tata Harper Repairative Moisturizer 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* It's not for me since my skin is oily, but it's a fab product if you're OK with emollients and fragrance (very well harvested and preserved via pump).\n   * *Cost:* \n   * *How I use it:* Since my skin is oily/combo, I don't often use this to be honest. This would be perfect for daily use for dry skin types or those that can get away with a product that gives some more shine.\n   * *Ingredients:* Simply too many to list. Check them out [here](https://incidecoder.com/products/tata-harper-repairative-moisturiser). \n* **SkinMedica TNS Ceramide Treatment Cream: 4/5** Also not going to go super in depth here. TNS is the same as mentioned above, but this formula is a lot cheaper and has a much more emollient feel. I only use it post-procedure. Will RP when I have another procedure (esp. microneedling or Morpheus).\n* **SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic: 4/5** Not going to say a whole lot here. But I did figure out that the Vit E in this way causing some closed comedones, so I had to stop using it on the face. Won't be RP for that reason.\n* **First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream: 4/5** Want to revise the record and say that I do believe this broke me out a few times on the face. Great for dry areas on the body, eczema, or post-procedure. Not great for face if oily.\n* **SkinCeuticals AGE Eye Complex:** **4/5 since I am 26 and advanced glycation end products probably not a huge issue for me**\n   * *Summary:* I wrote a review of this in my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionLux/comments/102f0zu/i_spent_2k_on_skincare_so_you_dont_have_to/), and I don’t think much has changed, although I do think that I can effectively minimize any irritation from this product with applying a small amount. I’ve taken a deeper dive into some of the ingredients. \n   * *How I use it:* Just a little bit below the eyes in the morning\n   * *Cost:* $105 for 15mL\n   * *Ingredients:* \n      * First off, like 7/10 first ingredients are about viscosity and skin-feel and that definitely comes through when you apply the product. It’s hard in the jar but slips on the face very nicely. This is also good for ensuring it lasts a long time. \n      * There are also a number of compounds that scatter light such as Nylon-12, reducing the appearance of fine lines. \n      * It also obviously features Pro-Xylane (thanks L’Oreal). I tried to find some independent research on this (and [this](https://www.wcd2019milan-dl.org/abstract-book/documents/late-breaking-abstracts/45-wound-healing/proxylane-a-plant-sugar-derivative-9.pdf) is the closest I could find). Basically L’Oreal claims that it helps restore the ECM (extracellular matrix, which is where collagen, elastin, and many of the other things responsible for skin appearance lie). \n      * We also have Ascorbyl Glucoside (AG) in this formula, which makes sense regarding skin firmness and lightening. Jury is still out on in-vivo skin penetration of AG but it does create a reservoir of Vit C in the skin because it takes time for it to be converted into ascorbic acid (AA). \n      * There is caffeine in this formula as well, which we know is an antioxidant and helps with circulation.\n      * There is some UV protection from titanium dioxide. \n      * There’s also Hesperdin Methyl Chalcone which is derived from citrus and has blood vessel protecting properties. It’s at minimum an antioxidant and at maximum can help reduce dark circles due to its effect on vasculature. \n      * There’s anthocyanins in the form of bilberry extract but it’s far down on the ingredients so who knows how impactful that is. \n      * There are also a number of peptides in this formula which should help contribute to a firming effect. \n* **Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a cult favorite from an iconic brand in the Green Beauty space. \n   * *Cost:* $68 for 1oz.\n   * *How I use it:* I use this once a week with the Regenerating Cleanser ([as Tata suggests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfrVxpoG_Nw)), which I use on dry skin and then layer with this mask. Leave on for 5 minutes, rinse, and my face feels great.\n   * *Ingredients:* If I had to write a complete summary of ingredients for all of her products, we'd be here all day & I would hit the word limit. So I'm going for an abridged approach.\n      * The primary active in this product is Salix Alba Bark Extract (willow bark) which is a natural BHA source. \n      * Despite being a resurfacing mask, there are a number of effective soothing complexes in this formula, namely 2 types of aloe. You could argue that Beet Root is a soother as well, although it's primarily a source of antioxidants and functions as a humectant.\n      * There is lactobacillus ferment, which Estee Lauder introduced in 2009 as a DNA repair enzyme and an antioxidant. There's also pomegranate enzyme which is extract using lactobacillus, although this functions more as an exfoliant.\n      * Radish Root Extract, which you'll find in Dr. Barbara Strum products + some (all?) versions of p50. This works both as a preservative in the formula but also as an antimicrobial on the skin.\n      * Kaolin clay — a gentler alternative to Bentonite which work as a mild abrasive and oil-wicking agent.\n      * Note there are a number of irritants in this product, so if you're sensitive to fragrance, be cautious.\n* **Maya Chia The Straight A Gentle Retinol Treatment 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* I used this for 2 weeks. For the first week, my skin had a glow like no other. For the second week, I broke out. It's comedogenic for folks with more oily-type skin.\n   * *Cost:* $125 for 30mL\n   * *How I use it:* At night, after cleansing and a serum (optional).\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Lots of strong emollients which are plant derived and serve double duty as antioxidants as well: Chia seed oil, Rose hip oil, Raspberry seed oil, Buriti oil, Sunflower seed oil, Vitamin E\n      * Encapsulated retinol optimizes the retinol delivery system into the skin, and keeps it fresh for longer\n      * Natural retinol alternatives: Moth bean extract and bakuchiol which promote cell turnover (retinol's main mechanism of action)\n      * Tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate (THDA) is a form of vit C which has [shown promise](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrahexyldecyl-ascorbate) but is less proven than straight up AA. \n* **Neocutis Lumiere Firm Eye Cream 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* I really like this eye cream and I might RP. I love the pump, and I love the packaging. It does make a difference and my sensitive eyes tolerate it well. I wonder if it has been slightly too thick for my oily skin even though the eyes and cheeks run drier.\n   * *Cost:* $108 for 15mL\n   * *How I use it:* In eye area (not above) once a day, very small amount gently rubbed in\n   * *Ingredients:* Not going to go into too much detail here: it has caffeine, vit C (as THDA, AA, and ascorbyl palmitate), beech tree bud extract, lecithin, HA, licorice extract for brightening, peptides, growth factors, and chamomile. It's a multi-pronged formula with a lot of promise and gentle but effective actives.\n* **Consonant Hydrextreme 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is an excellent humectant product. It's very simple. I will not be RPing at this time because it's a bit too simple for me + feels like it doesn't go as far as some of the other options in this space.\n   * *Cost:* $112 for 30mL\n   * *How I use it:* After actives, before moisturizer, with wet hands.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Glycerin: it's probably the least offensive and most popular humectant. You probably already know it :). This is a high concentration formula that is not tacky or sticky.\n      * Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide: this is a plant sugar with emollient properties and is a good source of antioxidants ([source](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-cassia-angustifolia-seed-polysaccharide.html)).\n* **Aveeno Tone and Texture Renewing Night Cream 3/5**\n   * *Summary:* It's a good product. The PHA exfoliant is not quite strong enough for my KP so I will not be RPing, but it's a good choice if you have more sensitive skin on the body.\n   * *Cost:* $10 for 8oz on Amazon\n   * *How I use it:* On the body, roughly twice a week.\n   * *Ingredients:* I love the way that Aveeno breaks down the ingredients so see [here](https://www.aveeno.com/products/tone-texture-gentle-renewing-night-cream) if you're curious.\n* **Tata Harper Body Revitalizing Oil 3/5** Not going to do a deep dive here. The ingredients are quality, but it's too small of an amount for the price (considering that it goes on the body so you need much more).\n* **Tata Harper Resurfacing Body Serum 3/5** Same thing here. It's a fabulous formula but it's way too expensive for how much you'd need to use on the body. The bottle might give you 15 uses on the full body, which is just hard to justify.\n* **SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Masque: 3/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a calming masque and SC claims it decreases your skin surface temperature by something like 5 degrees (ok). It's been sitting almost full in my cabinet for a while — it's nice but won't RP unless it's for post-procedure for something majorly irritating (phenol peel?).\n   * *Cost:* $66 for 60mL\n   * *How I use it:* Almost never lol. Would be great for post procedure.\n   * *Ingredients:* There is not a whole lot of extra detail to add here as compared with the gel described above. There are a few additional ingredients that are worth mentioning: Acetyl Dipeptide-1 Cetyl Ester is a dipeptide that has skin calming and fibroblast protecting properties (PC agrees but [here's](https://www.activepeptide.com/product/acetyl-dipeptide-1-cetyl-ester/) the link to buy it raw if you want to experiment yourself yikes).\n* **SkinMedica AHA/BHA Cream 2/5**\n   * *Summary:* It is confused about what it is and who it's for. I don't understand why there's so much more bilberry extract than exfoliants. I understand that these can be irritating products, but it feels like SM is putting the cart before the horse here. It should exfoliate first and foremost, and for me, it doesn't. No RP.\n   * *Cost:* $48 for 2oz\n   * *How I use it:* Almost never. It's probably fine to use morning and night, but depends on your face + wear SPF always but esp. in the AM if using AHAs.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Lots of Bilberry extract (2nd ingredient)\n      * Moisturizing/calming: Aloe, Glycerin, Squalane, Chamomile (2 types), B5\n      * Natural AHAs: Sugar Cane Extract, Orange Fruit Extract, Lemon Extract. To me, these are not astringent enough to be effective. Perhaps it's the rest of the moisturizer and emollience of the rest of the formula, but I just don't feel that this sloughs off the dead skin in the way that I want it to.\n      * There's also BHA (Salicylic acid), Vit E, and Vit C (as ascorbyl palmitate). Like I said — confused.\n* **Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay 2/5** Not going to go in depth here. I don't think I'll ever \\*have\\* to RP (since it's huge), but I don't think I would. It's very good for removing sebaceous filaments and pulling oil from the skin. It's a bit strong, but it's a good option if you struggle with oil control.\n* **Avene Eau Thermale 2/5**\n   * *Summary:* It's just water. \n   * *Cost:* $20\n   * *How I use it:* On my face\n   * *Ingredients:* Mineral water. Be careful — it's pH 7.5. If you put this on immediately after any actives that require a narrow pH range (e.g., AA, AHAs/BHAs), you are going to inactivate them. \n* **Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask: 1/5** Not going to go in depth here. Will not RP. It works but so does Aquaphor.\n* **Darphin Intral Inner Youth Serum 1/5**\n   * *Summary:* No change noticed during 2 months of use. Fragrance is a bit sickly-sweet. Will not RP.\n   * *Cost:* $50 for 15mL\n   * *How I use it:* At night after an irritating product (retinoid or exfoliant).\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Chief function of the serum is soothing: it has panthenol, chamomile, and Alteromonas ferment (which is used across the cosmetics industry as a soothing agent).\n      * There is moisturizing action here, too: glycerin, glycosaminoglycans, castor oil (low comedogenicity). This is obvious from the serum nature of the formula, but it's certain not a moisturizer in and of itself.\n      * Peony extract is one of the chief ingredients and scents. Cannot find anything about the benefits of this.\n\nIn the queue next for me: is Clinical Cleansing Complex, Herbivore's Nova and Bakuchiol, Chebula Serum by True Botanicals, SkinCeuticals Retexturing Activator, Glytone Brightening Cleansing Powder, and UltraCeuticals Vitamin A serum, Vivier V-Stat Scar Gel — any experiences or thoughts are welcome!!",

For those that don’t wish to watch the whole video a quick summary- rosacea inflammation could be a byproduct of hormone imbalance and gut inflammation. Amongst the more extreme recommendations of getting fully checked for gut bacteria etc, they recommended evening primrose and vitamin d supplements to regulate. \nWilling to try anything I picked some up at target a week ago. I’ve been taking the recommended three a day. (As well as gummy vitamin d) My skin is totally different In a week. The cysts underneath have shrunken away and the redness is starting to dissipate. I’m hoping this isn’t just luck or that I’m being too premature in posting this. I was diagnosed last year after the stress was causing what I thought was cystic maskne. Since then life has been hell dealing with this. I did the metrogel, the antibiotics that made my stomach ache, it just kept slowly coming back. I never suffered from acne as a teen or young adult, and this has been the worst. My heart goes out to all of you.

Annoying. Currently finding how to control hormonal acne.\n\nBut I think my wacky sleep schedule has definitely put my hormones on a rocker too I suspected. Simply because I remember sleeping at 11:20pm last year and I woke up at 4am then went back to sleep till 7 or 8am ish, and I was feeling so amazingly energetic, strong and pumped up to take on the day pretty much.\n\nBut my schedule then went back till now where I sleep at 2-4am, and my face hasn't been balanced so to speak. And my menstrual cycle hormone change clearly flares it up the most.\n\nI don't think I can go on birth control because of medication I take for a health condition, so I'll have to check this evening primrose supplement out.

Clinical evidence about Vitamin D has also been very mixed, with some studies finding that [rosacea patients might have elevated levels of Vitamin D](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23713748/#:~:text=Patients%20with%20rosacea%20have%20relatively,larger%20epidemiological%20studies%20are%20needed), suggesting that supplementation might be unhelpful or even counterproductive.\n\nReaders should note that rosacea is a complex condition, and what works for one person (especially for as little as a week) might not work for others. If you're concerned about your Vitamin D levels, it might help to **discuss this with you doctor(s)** to consider a blood test and discuss whether supplementation might be beneficial for you.",

And yours are probably out of whack too but in your own unique way. My advice would be to find a hormone specialist in your area and get some testing done. It’s not cheap but in my opinion it’s definitely worth it to be able to deal with the root cause of your acne. You can have your hormone levels checked, figure out what’s low and what’s high, and then learn how to balance them with the guidance of a legit professional. That way you don’t put your body through even more stress by trying all these different things that might honestly cause you more damage than what’s already been done. I’d keep things simple (in terms of skincare routine and diet) in the meantime and make note of the bad breakouts (when during your cycle, how were your stress levels, did you eat anything weird, etc). I wish you the very best in figuring it out because I know how hard it is to deal with ❤️",

    "body": "(Warning: Very long, but well organized.)\n\n**The bottom line: most of the physical changes brought on by HRT cannot be initiated by herbs alone.** However, herbs hold promise in a number of specific areas. First is that many are good at causing a few of the specific physical changes associated with HRT such as superficial facial fat redistribution and softening of the skin; I review an herb that is promising for hair growth. Second is that many can bring on positive mental effects that a number of trans people say are helpful to them, and some trans people report that herbs can give them a ‘taste’ of what estrogen is like as they decide if HRT is right for them. \n\n**Potential Advantages of Herbal Estrogenics**\n\nFirst, herbal treatments can be used in conjunction with prescription treatments to help transwomen reach specific gender goals. For example, if a trans person has only a partial response to their treatments (which can be caused by many things, such as [a genetically-heritable insensitivity of the estrogenic receptors which in such cases do not activate even in the presence of increasing blood levels](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/102/1/93/2804767?login=true), an herbal approach might help fill in gaps and facilitate changes in appearance and mood. That is, herbs could have an additive (‘adjunctive’) effect, potentially increasing the speed of certain changes or reducing side effects without doing much on their own. (See the last section for a discussion of whether/to what extent herbs may interact with prescription hormones.)\n\nSecond, herbal treatments could be used by ‘trans curious’ people who want to start experiencing changes but feel the pharmaceutical treatments would have too strong an effect for them. I would include in this group individuals who do not want some of the long-term effects of HRT (such as changes in the size and function of the genitals) while still desiring some degree of feminization. I have talked to a trans person who used Pueraria Mirifica alone because they did not want any changes to their genital function. \n\nLastly, some transgender women use herbs for ‘natural breast enhancement’, but I do not recommend this at all unless it is done with utmost care and only in conjunction with prescription treatments. I review 'natural breast enhancement' and talk about its pitfalls in a later section.\n\n**Most Promising Therapeutics**\n\n**Pueraria Mirifica (PM)** I consider to be the herb with the most potential for those on feminizing HRT. I first saw this recommended multiple times by trans people who said the following things: first, that it caused some slight physical changes (primarily skin changes, but even breast growth when it was taken in combination with other herbs). But these physical changes did not rival what can be achieved by pure estrogen. Its main advantage seems to be in terms of mental changes. I read a few trans people who claimed that PM helped them feel a calm that they said helped them feel ready to transition, and that helped them ‘test’ what taking estrogen might be like before considering use of the pharmaceuticals. \n\nPM seems to contain stronger estrogenic than any other plant I’ve read about. Interestingly, it seems to contain a mix of many of the same estrogenic found in other plants, but also some unique and powerful ones. Like soy it contains some estrogens that are isoflavones, which are quite weak plant-based estrogens but that seem to have lots of health effects. It contains [genistein, the chief isoflavone in soy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0731708506004626); it also contains [a number of other classes of plant-based estrogens such as coumarins](https://academic.oup.com/chromsci/article/55/3/214/2937908). What is most significant is that, in addition to essentially acting like a ‘super soy’ with all the strongest components of soy, it contains an estrogenic only found in this plant, ‘deoxymiroestrol', which is said to have very strong actions at the estrogen receptor – [at times close to or comparable to those of estrogen itself, according to this study which looked at its binding affinity to estrogen receptors.](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/np990547v)\n\nMirifica extract appears quite safe compared to many other hormonal herbs, with the most common side effect being nausea from overindulgence in it; further, it is used all over the medical system of Thailand as a ‘rejuvenating’ treatment and so has established itself as being reliable. The easiest route is to take 500mg of an oral extract (I recommend the brand Ainterol) and eventually increase to twice a day. A trans friend of mine, however, takes 3000mg. Other routes are possible: it could be made into a cream or spray. I have seen it recommended that trans individuals in addition to taking some of it orally can apply some spray of it 2-3 times daily to the breast and butt to potentially encourage feminization of those areas. While it is a documented ‘side effect’ that the herb alone when taken by men can make them grow breasts, I don’t think this is a very typical result that trans people can expect from using PM alone. I have seen people get results in the use of PM to grow breasts, but only when it was used with a few herbal anti-androgens which I consider to be of questionable safety (see the last section on the dangers of ‘natural breast enhancement’). \n\nPM need not be taken daily and it need not be taken long-term, although I don’t think it would be very unsafe to do so in most cases. Some trans people may prefer to use it for a time until they can see results from it and then phase it out. One can read stories of many using mirifica on the ‘natural breast enhancement’ forum Breast Nexus. What is generally reported from growth with mirifica is that, unfortunately, in genetic women much of it does revert when it is stopped along with the herbs that are typically taken along with it. However, I do think it is possible that if mirifica does cause changes at strategic times during the transition, these might be lasting due to the strength of the pharmaceuticals taken with it. One could imagine, for example, taking mirifica only in the first few months of a transition, or only before one begins pharmaceutical treatments. I do not think it is likely to interact negatively with prescription HRT drugs. While some phytoestrogens seem to compete with estrogen and block it, PM does not seem to be likely to do that as, besides the strong and powerful deoxymiroestrol, most of the estrogenic effects are isoflavone based meaning they are mild and mostly work in the background.\n\n**Mint** acts as [a mild anti-androgen according to clinical studies](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ptr.2900?casa_token=mJIY3VfTbhAAAAAA:wRxTzjJ-c-0yRsUjs956vA2XVPCO1m4SlGjgp7vHT_PaCMXRY_W4F1sGix6P170bx91la3gRB8fSHuh9), and I’ve seen many positive reports from trans people about it. It seems to quite reliably soften the skin when taken as a tea. Further, many report anxiety-reduction from the regular use of it. This would likely be in addition to its digestion-promoting properties, which it has been used for over thousands of years. Mint is likely safe and healthy when taken as a tea, but it can be overdone, as the chief constituent – menthol – can be irritating in high doses (everyone who has ever used mouth wash knows this). I recommend using spearmint over peppermint when making the tea since spearmint has a lower menthol content; if you wanted some peppermint taste, you could try making the tea with 2/3rds spearmint and 1/3rd peppermint.\nHowever, while high-menthol preparations of mint aren’t safe internally, they can be applied directly to the skin which can help you experience the skin-softening effects of mint. I recommended medicated soaps and lotions made with strong quantities of mint, of which I think the finest are those soaps and lotions made by the company Dr. Bronners. \n\n**Bhringraj** is an estrogenic herb in India that is known as ‘food for the hair’. It is infused into a body oil and used as a hair growth treatment, to prevent or reverse balding as well as to make hair  grow faster and shinier. It contains a number of [coumarin estrogenics as well as some alkaloids unique to the plant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4897414/). Its ability to grow hair is attested to not only by thousands of years of medical practice in India but also by science, as in a study of the rat it [performed well in a head-to-head with minoxidil.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18478241/)\n\nThough properly made Bhringraj oil cannot easily be obtained in the United States, it is easy enough to make. I made some according to [this recipe](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2013/03/25/how-to-make-bhringraj-oil-for-hair-growth-video/), but leaving out the other herbs and milk and merely using 2.5x the bhringraj called for in the recipe along with the base oil. I tested it out on my hair (which was very short at the time), leaving it in overnight before washing it out (yes it was very greasy). I cannot deny that it worked because I noticed something very strange with my hair the next few days: I began having new hairs sprout in many new directions, which looked strange and very noticeable with my short hair. I do admit it looked disheveled for a while, but if I had continued the treatment I believe the new sprouting hairs would’ve been strong enough and vibrant enough to look nice. \n\n**Soy** alone is very unlikely to cause any kind of feminization. But, it is still a good idea for trans women to take soy given its well-proven positive effects for women’s endocrine health. We simply do not need another study to show [the considerable anti-cancer effects of regular use of soy](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/acamc/2013/00000013/00000008/art00005); it has been established clearly enough.\n\nSoy contains isoflavones in the same way that PM does, and it even contains some of the same ones – both soy and PM contain ‘[genistein](https://academic.oup.com/carcin/article/17/2/271/269781?login=true)’, which is perhaps the most well-studied phytoestrogen. Both are genetically related and found in the legume family. Unlike PM, however, soy does not contain some of the more potent estrogenics found in PM which explains its much weaker effects. \n\nI highly recommend whole-plant soy over any kind of bottled extract. One simply will not get the full range of isoflavones using an extract, and there are sometimes benefits to some of the constituents in plants that are only found in small concentrations in it. So, I’d recommend the addition of whole soy to the diet a few times a week. Again it won’t cause immediate or noticeable changes, unless you consider a slight increase in healthiness a noticeable change. \n\n**The challenges of herbal anti-androgens: Why ‘natural breast enhancement’ is suspect**\n\nThere is no doubt that herbal breast growth ‘works’ for trans people in the sense that there are in fact combinations of herbs which can be taken and can semi-reliably cause breast growth. Such things are attested to by enough evidence, and I already mentioned breast nexus as once such place where one can find accounts and timeline evidence. But the concern with ‘natural breast enhancement’ (NBE) is that the herbs needed to make it work tend to be toxic. While the herbs I discussed earlier in this review are those that I think can make good consistent medicines, people who do NBE use herbs known to be more dangerous when taken long-term. One common example of an NBE regimen used by some trans women is the combination of mirifica, fenugreek and saw palmetto. Saw palmetto works a bit like Finasteride in [stopping the conversion of testosterone to DHT](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2840915/), however it carries effects some trans individuals do not want such as [an increase in test levels, and potentially a decrease in estrogen levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2525623/); Further, many studies show it to be unreliable in doing things like reducing prostate problems. It thus hardly counts as an anti-androgen in any concrete sense. Fenugreek is taken to increase progestin levels, but it also [might act as an aromatase inhibitor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6191980/) and so, again, may increase testosterone levels. Further, fenugreek seems to exert downright [toxic effects on the reproductive system when used long term, negatively impacting not just test but estrogen too](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27498339/). Neither of these things should ever be used for more than a few weeks; they cannot be part of a long-term treatment plan.\n\nAnd so, most ‘NBE’ stacks do ‘work’ to grow breasts at the cost of being generally unhealthy and causing a lot of unwanted effects. Further, they may not cause feminization of any other parts of the body, and this can in my opinion create a kind of ‘unnatural’ look where the breasts don’t seem to fit the body and which makes it look like one has gotten implants installed even though they were grown 'naturally'. \n\nAnd so the number one issue with feminizing herbs is that it is very very difficult to take any herb that can reliably suppress testosterone and yet lack significant side effects. Simply put, there doesn’t really ‘exist’ a simple, effective herbal anti-androgen. Peppermint is about the closest one can get, but its effects – while apparent in the skin – aren’t likely to be enough to initiate breast growth on its own even with herbal estrogenics. One reason herbal estrogenics simply don’t do much in the body of a trans person is that, unlike endogenous estradiol, they simply aren’t present in high enough concentrations to really suppress T. One option in the use of herbals might be to combine them with a low-to-medium dose of something like bica, a pharmaceutical anti-androgen. Of course, this defeats the purpose for some who seek the herbal approach precisely to avoid the long-term changes brought on by pharmaceutical treatments. \n\nI am still exploring whether there are any reliable herbal anti-androgens. Neem is a strong anti-androgen but it is also an anti-estrogen. The best herbal anti-androgen I have seen so far seems to be licorice. Licorice reduces serum test levels in men: this study found that [the average in respondents went from 740+/-216 to 484+/-181 after only a week of a strong licorice extract.](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJM199910073411515?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed) A [similar anti-androgenic result](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15579328/) was obtained in women. Unlike Fenugreek, licorice seems to have less of a risk of long-term side effects, although I have yet to review the safety studies. Further, some say that white peony roots are an aromatase promoter and reduce testosterone levels, though I have not yet reviewed those studies yet. Ultimately, while you can find positive results for both these substances, it is merely a theoretical guess as to whether they can realistically suppress T enough to allow a trans person to transition from herbs alone. If it would safe, one would probably want to extract the main chemical principles from licorice and apply them in a more reliable form than an oral tablet. I do not know whether that might be possible but I offer it as an area for future study.\n\nIn the meantime, I am of the opinion that mirifica, taken orally and also applied to the breasts in a cream or spray, is unlikely to impede growth brought on by pharmaceuticals and may help it along. In that case, there really is such a thing as ‘natural breast enhancement’ but only if one does not use herbs alone but rather uses them as additive treatments in addition to prescription HRT. \n\nAs a last note, I should say that palmetto and fenugreek could potentially be mixed together and made into a cream and applied directly to the breast. This *might*– emphasis on ‘might’ – be absorbed enough locally to encourage growth while not being absorbed enough throughout the whole body to experience the reproductive-toxic effects of fenugreek. I would still recommend caution with this approach, and I still think it would be a bad idea to do for more than a few weeks. \n\n**A Note on Safety**\n\nMany of these herbs which I call safe are only safe in the quantities typically given as treatment – for most, this amounts to between .5 and 4 grams. The problem is the ‘supplements’ market contains many products boasting of ‘strong extracts’ which, if you looked at their chemical constituents, would be the equivalent of 4 grams or more. (See, for an example, [this Ashwagandha extract from the quality Indian brand Himalaya](https://himalayausa.com/products/organic-ashwagandha) – Himalaya is a good brand and so I do trust their claim that one tablet is equivalent to 4600mg of herb. But that’s not per se a good thing. 4 grams is over the dose typically given of it to those who aren’t habituated, such that just one single tablet of the Himalaya extract could be ‘too strong’ a dose). The best way to dose is to use powdered herb measured with a scale or in teaspoons. Even this does not guarantee a consistent dose however as even some of those powders are ‘extract powders’ that are many times stronger than the herb itself.\n\nSo, given that consistency is hard to find, the best approach is the careful one, trying out just a little at a time to see if you feel anything. Many of these herbs have the advantage of causing at least some noticeable changes in mental state upon the first day to week in which they’re taken; so you can use this to adjust your dose and not rely on what some company claims is the optimal dose. In fact, I’d wager that with herbs, dosing tends to be more individual than in pharma treatments (since they seem to exert their effects mostly down-stream, and in a less predictable way). So, start with one herb at a time and go slowly in evaluating its effects. If one enjoys the experimental aspect of this, they might really like the herbal approach. IF, however, one would have a hard time moderating themselves in this manner, I’d suggest they go on pharma treatments fully before trying herbs. Though I do not have specific evidence to point to for this claim, it seems quite logical to me that herbs are less likely to cause hormonal side effects if one is taking consistent daily medications that they can use to guarantee their estrogen levels. That does not mean side effects CAN’T happen (and many of these estrogenics do not exert their effect by direct action on estrogen levels – such that the estrogen level could stay the same despite them having efficacy), but I am merely hazarding a guess that side effects would be less likely.\n\nSome of the herbs discussed here contain aromatic compounds that are available in extremely potent extracts known popularly as ‘essential oils’ (although these extracts are not actually oils and contain no fatty acids, but types of alcohol). Though some essential oils are more toxic than others, **all essential oils are extremely dangerous and are basically types of bleach - very strong, volatile and toxic solvents that will irritate the skin, lungs and digestive tract.** Even if the herb itself is extremely safe, the essential oil will still be highly toxic because of its concentration. To give a sense of how concentrated, it is said that there are over 2000 roses in a single drop of rose oil. Needless to say, **never consume anything made with essential oils, and do not mix any medical preparations with them unless you know how to do it exactly.** \n\nBut you might ask how it is that there exist some edible products sold at supermarkets that contain the essential oil if it is so toxic. For example, Fentiman’s rose lemonade is a soft drink that is infused with rose oil. The answer is that these products are made by experienced producers who know how to mix these oils and what percent is safe for consumption. If you lack that knowledge, don’t even try it. It is far harder to mix them into food than it might appear because of their thickness, and so the end result of using them can be a food product with the oil unevenly distributed, and eating this could make you sick. While some diffuse these oils in a diffuser, I personally find even this to be too irritating. I find the best way to use them is in waters, sprays and soaps formulated to have appropriate concentrations of these oils, as many of the oils which are toxic internally can be good when used on the skin. If some of the herb is wanted internally, it is better to get the plant itself and make a proper tea and leave the oils behind. \n\n**Estrogenics in skincare**\n\nSo much of the use of herbs in skincare is basically taking advantage of their hormonal effects. Name an herb that is commonly used on the skin, and nine out of ten times it generally has a clear effect on the levels of the two biggest sex hormones. If aromatics are applied to the skin, not as much is absorbed into the whole body; mostly it exerts its effect in the area of the skin where it was applied. I maintain that estrogenic herbs could play a role in helping trans people achieve gender goals related to their face and their skin. While it is of course extremely unlikely that topical treatments could do anything mimicking the long-term facial changes that occur after years of HRT, I am actually quite certain they can bring on some of the early changes HRT brings on in the face – skin smoothening and superficial fat reorganization. I have observed this myself, both in seeing before-after pictures of my own skincare regimen and that of others. Further, this is the entire principle behind a ‘spa treatment’, in which a number of estrogenic herbs are used to create a look of ‘youthfulness’ (which is to say, a feminized look.) There is a clear science behind this in that these herbs do exert clear hormonal effects, as I will now review. \n\nEstrogenic flowers seem well-suited for use in skincare.  The active ingredients in estrogenic flowers are usually aromatic compounds – linalool in lavender, geraniol in rose and rose geranium, etc. Aromatic compounds, unlike some other plant estrogens discussed earlier (e.g. isoflavones in PM and soy), are highly reactive and their effects don’t last long. Further, as compared to other estrogenics they seem to exert more immediate effects on mentality, with some describing some flowers and flower oils are ‘calming’, ‘stimulating’, etc, when applied to skin or used in a diffuser. \n\nThese aromatic compounds are the very same plant-alcohols which, as I said earlier, are present in large toxic concentrations in the ‘essential oils’ of the plant. If you want a high dose of them, you cannot take them internally in their essential oil as this is quite caustic and can give you a chemical burn or seizure. So, if you want systemic effects from them, you’d have to settle for a tea made from the whole flowers. I do say that lavender tea and rose tea create pleasant calming effects. I doubt however that either of these when used alone would ever cause any significant feminization of the body (e.g. breast growth). While there were reports of lavender oil and tea tree oil in a lotion causing breast growth, this was only four isolated cases in prepubescent boys and it would be very very unlikely in an AMAB adult with functioning genitals. \n\nOf flowers, the most estrogenic in [this study](http://nel.altamira.sk/userfiles/articlesnew/NEL370816A06.pdf) (as measured by the increases in saliva estrogen concentrations in the study participants) was found to be **rose**. Rose in the form of rose water is most efficaciously used in skincare as a toner, applied and rubbed into the skin after cleansing but before moisturizing. Any changes in the skin will be subtle at first and most apparent after consistent use.\n\nHowever, the very strongest estrogenic skincare herb is **Centella Asiatica**. While some take asiatica by mouth, and it is a potent [anti-androgen](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20589353/) and [estrogenic](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.5061907)  as evidenced by studies, to me it is inadvisable to take internally because this would make one develop a tolerance to it that may weaken its skincare effects. Centella asiatica’s estrogenic action in the skin takes the form of a potent, fast-acting skin calmer, [acting on the same neurotransmitters in the skin (GABA) that alcohol acts on in the CNS.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27062315/)  (Of course it won’t get you drunk, but you might feel a tiny buzz from heavy use of asiatica concentrates on skin. But your mileage will vary). Asiatica acts faster than most skincare treatments, as it is capable of quickly reducing redness in acne and shrinking it. Where other acne treatments mostly kill the acne, asiatica leaves it alone and just calms the skin by its strong estrogenic action. \nI maintain that trans people should use asiatica differently than genetic women. Genetic women typically use asiatica as a ‘spot treatment’, applied directly to acne or acne scars and capable of reducing the redness overnight (its efficacy at this was confirmed by my own experiments). However, trans people’s faces unlike genetic women’s faces need the estrogenic action all over. So, I have found the very quickest way to feminize the skin in my face is to apply strong asiatica ‘spot treatment’ all over my entire face (I use the ‘asiatica serum’ and ‘asiatic ampule’ by the brand CosRX, which are VERY concentrated). This creates a smoothening and shininess of the skin overnight which, by my judgement, results in a noticeable and quite quick feminization of the face.\n\nOne should take care not to overuse asiatica. Since its calming action is strong, one can develop a tolerance to it. It is best rotated and used a few times a week or even less depending on results; but one can perhaps use it on acne spots on a more consistent basis. \n\nNeem, an Indian herb, is mainly used on the skin as an acne or fungus treatment. It is powerfully anti-microbial. Pure neem oil is often dabbed onto a cotton swab in very small amounts (say, 1-5 drops) and then used as a ‘spot treatment’ for acne. Neem is [very strongly anti-androgen and when given in high doses in an oral extract reduced testosterone levels substantialy](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/399/1/012106/pdf#:~:text=Neem%20leaf%20extract%20affects%20the,into%20a%20male%20contraceptive%20candidate.) however [it is also anti-estrogenic too](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.4983425). It is ‘safe’ to take internally in the sense that it is not very acutely toxic (the lethal dose is very high), but the proper way to do it is only small amounts of powdered herb (1-3 tsp). (Of course never taken neem pure oil internally: see the note on safety.) An Indian doctor I talked to said neem must be rotated at least 2 weeks on/2 weeks off because taking it for too long internally could be damaging to the microbiome. This seems quite plausible given its strong anti-bacterial action.\n\n**Hormone balancers and adaptogens** \n\n**Shatavari** is a medicinal herb cultivated and used in India as a ‘beauty tonic’, that is, something taken regularly that is meant to encourage youthfulness. In practice, what ‘beauty tonic’ means is nothing other than that it is capable of causing some superficial feminization of outer features. In this author’s own experience, 4 weeks of shatavari caused subtle changes in the look of the face, which were subtle enough that no one could identify them specifically although one who did not know I am transitioning noticed that there was some kind of change (though they didn’t associate it with any gender). I myself began noticing changes after 2 weeks. Shatavari is known as an ‘adaptogen’, and what that means in practice is that it is neither a stimulant nor calming agent, but has different effects depending on one’s body.\n\nWhile Shatavari seems to be a powerful and potentially very useful herb, *it’s effects will GREATLY depending on the state of your hormones when you start it.* In men struggling with impotence, it actually increases testosterone. If estrogen is high, it can be anti-estrogenic. \n\nThough it is a daily medication in India, however, Shatavari is not to be taken lightly. **I do not recommend taking shatavari if one has recently increased their dose of hormones and anticipates large changes.** Shatavari is a hormone stabilizer. The main purpose of shatavari is to prevent any major drops in hormone levels one way or another. The second purpose is that it can be added for the aforementioned ‘beauty tonic’ effects (that is to say, slight, superficial facial feminization) ONLY if one has been on a stable dose for a while.\n\nShatavari can easily be overdone. I’d recommend not using any ‘bottled extract’ of shatavari as that will probably give too high a dose (some of those extracts are the equivalent of 4g or more of the powdered herb). Instead, start with 1-3 tsp of the herb mixed with warm water and drank; it could also be filtered into a tea if you wanted a more pleasant drink but weaker effect.\n\nShatavari appears to slightly increase progesterone, and is traditionally used as a ‘galactagogue’ to encourage the production of breast milk. However, I doubt very much that it can be relied on as a ‘progesterone treatment’ due to the other effects it has which might counteract any changes that could be brought on by the progesterone. \n\n**Other Herbs not reviewed**\n\nThere are many herbs used as supplements for hormonal conditions like menopause that I did not discuss here. I didn’t do so because I simply do not know much about them. This includes motherwort, which is sold as a menopause supplement in China; and evening primrose oil, which is also widely used as a menopause supplement. The only note I’d make on primrose oil is, one should probably mix it with food for better absorption. \n\nIf I were to add to this, I’d focus specifically on whether there are any herbs that can reliably and safely increase progesterone. (Though I discussed that shatavari has the potential to do this, it of course is not the reliable choice for this due to its many different and sometimes unwanted effects on hormones.) I’d also look into a safer alternative to fenugreek that might more specifically promote breast growth.\n\n**On the Concern that herbs may interfere with prescription treatments**\n\nSome worry that these herbs might actually counteract the effects of their prescription medications. This is sometimes a concern depending on the substance, but generally this worry is unfounded. The studies that show some of these to possess ‘anti-estrogenic’ effects usually get this result when these phytoestrogens are cultured in breast cancer cells. But if these are anti-estrogenic in cases where estrogen is making the body sick, such as breast cancer, that is a positive and not a negative. This type of study, which uses very high concentrations of the phytoestrogens, do not at all tell you what the phytoestrogen is doing in the body in the concentrations found in the blood from oral administration. Making this even more complicated is that many of these phytoestrogens seem to exert their effects beyond their direct and immediate action at the receptor, and seem to continue having some residual effects even after they are no longer in the blood (which explains why these herbal medicines can even work at all even when their bioavailability generally is found to be very low.) To me, it seems extremely unlikely that estrogen could be outcompeted or blocked by any of these compounds which bind to the estrogen receptor at generally much lower affinity than estrogen; so I doubt that any of these phytoestrogens usually block estrogen except in cases where estrogen is exceptionally low. And if it activates the receptors instead of estrogen in those cases where concentrations are very low, it might actually be more estrogenic than the endogenous hormone in those specific situations. All this is speculation, but it is just as much speculation as is the claim that phytoestrogens ‘block estrogen’. \n\nThese indirect effects might, rather than undermining estrogen when combined, work along with it: while estrogen binds to the receptor, these phytoestrogens might exert their effects down the line at other estrogen receptors, and could work in concert. Of course, as I make clear in this post there are some herbs that bind to estradiol receptors and are *definitely* anti-estrogenic (see neem.) And some herbs like pomegranate seem to be quite selectively anti-estrogenic. Pomegranate I judge to be very unlikely to initiate physical changes and may even slow them, as it appears to undermine the actions of the main estrogen b-17-estradiol. However, it directly activates a-17-estradiol receptors, the other type of estrogen receptor found mainly in the brain. I am not sure if this has any medical applications for trans people, but I give the example to show how varied the effects of these phytoestrogens can be. One must look specifically at what has been found about the specific herb in question. Even if we find it binds to estradiol receptors we must investigate more to see if it is a blocker, agonist, selective agonist or modulator.\n \nNow, I do not discount the possibility that some herbs which help some may interfere with the actions of estrogen in others. Hormones are very individual. If herbs are to be used at all, careful monitoring must be done.",

    "body": "We did it!!\n\nPregnancy:\nI classify my pregnancy as \"eh.\" I threw up A LOT for the first five months. At least once a day from week 4-16, then around once a week until week 20, 21ish. At six months I got a stress fracture (from dancing in high heels!) and was put in a boot for 6 weeks. Living in hilly San Francisco (and working as a nanny) this was tough. \n\nI stayed very active throughout the pregnancy (was always active before), running a few races and when I got the boot moving to yoga. So some sort of activity 3-6 days a week, up until week 41.\n\nBy week 41 I had had no progress. No Braxton Hicks, not even a fingertip dialated.  Nothing. I was scheduled for an induction for 41 + 5 (the 21st at 4 pm) and was really stressed about it. I was hoping for an unmedicated delivery and I know inductions can be slippery slopes. \n\nI decided to try ALL THE THINGS. I had been eating dates since week 38, but I added evening primrose oil, Mother's Blend tincture, sex, ball sitting.  Acupuncture. Everything.\n\nI think the primrose oil pills (stuck up my vagina) worked once I figured out to shove them all the way back. The very next I started losing my mucus plug (41+3). Also acupuncture was GREAT both mentally and physically. I went three times (on the 13th, the 19th, and the 20th). Each time I left my uterus was rock hard all day long. The acupuncturist specialized in \"induction acupuncture\" so she was very understanding/soothing to a very frustrated overdue pregnant woman.\n\nThe day before I went into labor I was in a rough spot. I was binge watching 16 and Pregnant, crying at the TV, crying at my husband about how there was just no. more. room.\n\n\nThat night, right before 2AM, I turned over in bed and felt like a little pee came out. No big deal, I had a pad on, it didn't feel like much, and at this point in pregnancy I was used to such bodily fluids. (spoiler alert: my water broke!)\n\nA few minutes later I woke up to a sharp pain. I noted the time (2 exactly) and tried to go back to sleep. 7 minutes later I was awakened again, the pain pretty strong right away.  A period-like cramp that got worse and worse until it felt like my insides were being squeezed, then the pain would subside. 6 minutes later I was awake again, then another 6. Time to get up.  I went to the toilet and peed while I labored (or so I thought it was pee...). \nI downloaded a contraction timer and was very quickly timing 45 second contractions, roughly 3 minutes apart.\n\n...Now here's the thing. I volunteer as a birth doula several times a month at a local hospital.  I know that (especially for FTM) labor takes time. I've seen countless people come into the hospital ready to have their kid only to find out they are hours if not days away...\n\nSo I was sort of in denial about the frequency of my contractions. Surely they would slow down.\n\nI suddenly got very, very cold.  Shivering. I decided to get in the bathtub to see if things slowed down and to warm up. At this point my husband woke up and asked if I was okay. \"I'm fine, I'm just in labor.\" He came in and poured cups of water on me as I labored which was amazing. He eventually put a towel on top of me because I was still shivering even though the water was pretty hot. We texted our doula and gave an update, but I told my husband it wasn't time for her to come over because there was a long way to go.\n\nShit got real painful.  I read Mindful Birthing and planned on using a lot of breath work during labor. Well that went out the window when the contractions made it very hard to breathe.  I started to panic. If things hurt this bad now, how would I make it through labor the way I wanted? How was I going to climb this mountain when all my \"tools\" weren't working?  I started focusing on parts of my body that weren't in pain. I'd run my fingers through my hair or think about my fingernails my toes, anything to try and isolate the painful feelings. \n\nI got out of the tub and tried laying down again but that was more painful than anything. I found that bracing myself between the sink and towel rack and swaying back and forth seem to help. \n\nThe whole time my husband was there watching, timing the contractions, gently asking if I'd like to try some hip compressions or other things we had learned. I wanted none of it. I wanted to go inside myself, be alone, and work through the pain one second at a time. \n\nI got back in the shower and this is when shit got real. By then it was around 5:30AM. I was in my zone when suddenly my body started to bear down. Again, in denial about how quick things were moving, I figured I needed to poop.  I decided to try and poop in the shower because that's what was going to work. The urge came again and it's at this point I realize that I don't need to poop, I need to push this baby out and my body was going to start trying whether I was ready to or not.\n\nI told my husband that it was time to go, to call the doula, that we had waited too long for everything.\n\n\"Should we call 911?\" he asks.\n\n\"No, call the freakin lyft let's go!\" He brought me clothes to wear and helped me put them on (lol he thought I would want to put a sports bra on). We walked downstairs and a very young Lyft driver picks us up. \n\nI wait for the next contraction before getting in the backseat. \"Sorry, Sir, I'm in labor.\" I barely remember the driver/ride (mainly because I was laying down and pushing in the backseat) but my husband said he was pretty overwhelmed by the situation (rightfully so). \n\nAfter the longest 10 minute car ride of my life we pulled up to the hospital. My husband rushed in as I tried my best to follow behind. He found a security guard and a wheel chair and once the very nice woman saw my condition (I think I said \"Hi, I'm pushing\") she got me in the chair (painful) and rushed me to labor and delivery.\n\nWe wheeled past admittance, past triage, and straight into a room (I think someone called up). \n\nThings from here moved quick. Nurses worked in a flurry to get things set up and the on call doctor comes in to check me (I think I stripped my clothes off the moment I was out of the wheel chair). As I was thrashing around on the bed I hear her say \"Yup, she's complete, you can start pushing.\"\n\nMy doula shows up just in time. I keep shouting, \"this is too fast! This is happening to fast! I'm not prepared!\" The nurses assure me that this is the way to go. The doctor gently asks me if I wanted a natural labor and when I said yes she responds \"good.\" \n\nI pushed curled up in Happy Baby pose, my doula holding one leg and my masseuse friend (who my husband texted and who came just in time) held the other. (Side note: my husband is kind of a germaphobe and we discussed beforehand that although he would very much be present during birth he would probably not do well in providing the support I needed, hence the friend and doula.)  In between contractions/pushing they helped me soften/relax between my eyebrows, in my jaw, etc. This softening really helped me focus on the task ahead. \n\nI've read on here that pushing is satisfying and hurts less than contractions and while yes, I agree with that, it still really fucking hurts. I switched to a squat position and as he descended further down it felt like he hit every back nerve on the way down. After thirty more minutes of pushing I switched back to the Happy Baby pose (elevated by the bed) to help him get around my pelvis. \"GET HIM OUT!\" I kept shouting. The nurses, my doula, and my friend all kept assuring me he was right there, only a few more pushes, but I didn't believe any of them. The OB mentioned getting the vacuum (I had been pushing for an hour), I think because they could no longer find the heartbeat (the doppler thing was the only thing they managed to attach to me). I decided fuck that and pushed him out on the next push.\n\nWallace was born February 21st at 7:11 AM. He came out, sucked his thumb, then shit all over me.\n\nI tore pretty bad (3rd degree) and really really hated how the doctor had to push my stomach to get the placenta/blood clots out. I bled a lot so they gave me a few shots of stuff to help stop that. \n\nAfter:\nWe spent one night in the hospital before deciding to leave early. Too many people in/out of the room combined with really shitty beds led to this decision. And there's just no place like home.\n\nHealing has been rough. As someone who has stayed very active I was expecting to bounce back a little faster, but this tear has me moving very slowly. We walked to the grocery store yesterday (about half a mile) and I was exhausted afterwards.  Breastfeeding has been rough. It hurts when he first latches and I'm now dealing with engorgement (what I like to call Monster Boobs). But one step at a time, ya know??\n\nAll and all I am very happy with my birth experience. Unmedicated is what I wanted and I am so thankful for a fast labor, because who knows how it would've gone down if I had experienced a longer labor (and had choices!). And what I like to tell people is yes, I had a 5 hour labor, but to me it felt more like 41 weeks, 5 days, and 5 hours. :)\n\nI've included my baby tax as well as an updated progress pic (taken 3 days a.b)\n\nThank you so much to the baby bumps community. You were all so supportive, so valuable, and so fucking funny. \n\n[Progress Pics](http://imgur.com/a/jmQab)\n\n[Baby Tax](http://imgur.com/a/jmQab)\n(I didn't cover my face in the baby tax pic because it's not a shirtless pic of me.  Got a few creepy PMs during my pregnancy about how I looked in those pics. Weird!)\n\n\n",

        "body": "Useful list, thanks for making it! I’ve tried a few of them and have opinions on some others: \n\nPolypodium - it really works, I use it when I go to the beach or something else with a lot of sun exposure. The whole SPF from the inside thing does freak me out a bit so I don’t take it daily. \n\nZinc - good for wound healing, immunity, and nails. You can get it from food (pumpkin seeds and sesame seeds are great sources) but supplements are very safe so long as the dosage is low and/or it’s combined with a small dose of copper because the largest risk of getting too much zinc is copper deficiency. Up to 15mg/day of zinc is ok without copper or you can get a higher dose that includes like 1mg copper.\n\nCarotenoids - wouldn’t recommend isolated beta carotene supplements because of link to cancer risk but getting lots of beta carotene from carrots and sweet potatoes is completely safe and healthy. Can give you an orangeish tinge that some people like. Lutein and zeaxanthin supplements are safe and good for older people at risk of macular degeneration especially if they have blue eyes. Astaxanthin is safe but probably not necessary. Lycopene is very good for men with increased risk of prostate cancer or who already have it. \n\nI would not recommend anyone ever take a retinol vitamin A supplement unless your doctor tells you to. Dietary retinol is linked to [osteoporosis](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/vitamin-a-and-your-bones) and can cause hypervitaminosis a, while plant carotenes never do, because excess intake is harmlessly deposited in skin cells. \n\nNAD, NR, and precursors - the anti-aging hype on these was way overboard imo, they don’t look nearly as impressive in more recent research and the effective formulations are very expensive. Not worth it to me\n\nHyaluronic acid and plant ceramides - I thought both were a gimmick til I saw Paula’s choice is selling a HA/ceramide supplement. I’m trying a cheaper HA right now to see if it works and have been taking it for about 3 weeks. I have dry skin but it breaks out from heavy ingredients and oils so keeping it moist in the winter is a struggle. If supplements help I will gladly take them. I haven’t noticed my skin feeling different yet but I do think my face is more resilient to otc retinol in the past few weeks because I’ve been able to increase mine to daily. \n\nOn the plant ceramides, I think they’re intriguing and I might consider them but I also think there’s some risk there. While ceramides are uncontroversially good for topical skincare, inside the body they are [linked](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31502201/) \nto detrimental processes related to [diabetes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23835113/) and heart disease among other things. It’s possible that supplemental ceramides act differently from the ceramides we make ourselves, but I don’t know of any research on them other than the skin-related studies. Its also possible that dietary plant ceramides act differently from dietary animal ceramides but that also needs to be researched.",

    "body": "I had dry patches of skin u'd normally see with eczema, but last year I had a terrible flare up. Lots of blood stains on my sheets and clothes, flakes everywhere and a super intense itch all over my body. It looked nothing like my previous dry localized eczema, it now became this diffuse bloody itchy mess. Going to the dermatologist, I hoped for a solution, but instead I was met with corticosteroids and vaseline. This did not help my symptoms.\n\nBeing a medical student, I did some research myself. A year later, I found what was troubling me: **Urticaria** and **S. Aureus**. These causes don't typically respond to corticosteroids and moisturizing and NEED a separate solution. After doing so, I've gotten soooo much better. I see a lot of people in this sub that have very similar symptoms to mine and could very possible have the same problem as me. Let me explain how you could identify these condition in you and treat them accordingly:\n\n**URTICARIA**  \nHow to Identify:\n\nUrticaria is characterized by a **DEEP, intense itch**. You will feel like you have to scratch really hard in order to get to the itch, almost like its under your skin. Some people describe the itch to feel like little needles in your skin. The cause of this is a histamine release by mast cells in your skin triggered by things like **pressure** and **heat,** although other things are also possible. For me, this meant that I got an intense itch on my ass because I was sitting on it, and an intense itch in my legs at night because I took of my tight pants before bed. The main way you can identify urticaria is by looking at your skin at the place that has this deep itch: can you see any **red bumps**? These are hives, and are a sure tell-tale sign you got urticaria.\n\nHow to Treat:\n\nLuckily, this one is really easy to treat. Since it's caused by a histamine release, you should be taking **antihistamines** every day. They need time to build up concentration in your blood (they have a very long half life), so take them consistently for a while.\n\n**S. AUREUS**\n\nIf your main problem is **bleeding wounds**, Staphylococcus Aureus (S. Aureus for short) is your main suspect. S. Aureus is a bacteria found on about **90% of people with eczema**. This is because they thrive in an environment with a lot of broken skin. They aggravate the skin by releasing toxins and make your inflammation worse, reduce wound healing by infecting wounds and don't respond well to corticosteroids. Especially if you have wounds with a y**ellow crust, redness around the wound** and e**xcessive bleeding/slow healing** times, you likely got S. aureus causing your symptoms.\n\nNow the problem is that you cannot eradicate it from your skin, since its a common bacteria and you'll just get reinfected. The goal is to get a sufficient reduction in the amount of S. Aureus on the skin. The way you reduce it is twofold:  \n-**limit** the amount of S. Aureus on the skin\n\n-**stimulate** the amount of other healthy bacteria that can **outcompete** S. Aureus\n\nTherefore, **bleach baths** are a mediocre solution, as they do limit S. Aureus but also remove the good bacteria, giving S. Aureus an open field to reinfect the skin again.\n\n**Antibiotics** are specific and do work well, but they have a huge risk of developing resistant S. Aureus, at which point it won't work anymore. Therefore, they are not a long-term solution either.\n\nA very easy and safe way to reduce S. Aureus is use **natural products** that have been PROVEN to be effective against S. aureus. They have a very low possibility for developing resistance since they often attack the cell membrane. Apart from this, they also provide an additional anti-inflammatory effect, and some have even been proven to be equally/more effective than hydrocortison in reducing eczema symptoms!\n\nHere is a emulsion I made based on products that reduce S. Aureus and help eczema (you can find them all in this scientific paper: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667031322000422](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667031322000422) ):\n\n**Emulsion for S. Aureus:**\n\nI use **Shea Butter, Coconut Oil** and **Sunflower Oil** (just the normal one from the store) to make the base of about 100 ml. They all have proven effective in reducing S. Aureus while also being extremely effective at moisturizing and reducing inflammation.\n\nI then add small amounts of **Rosemary Oil** (just 3-5 drops)**, Chamomile Oil** (just 3-5 drops), **Argan Oil** (10 drops) and **Glycerin** (10 drops) (Glycerin is not against S. Aureus but is naturally found in human skin and impaired in eczema). These are a bit more expensive, but very effective at low concentrations, hence why I include them.\n\nNow you could use ANY of these products alone and you probably will see an effect, but combining them will basically bundle their strengths since they all have slightly different mechanisms of action.\n\n**General recommendation**\n\nFinally, since this is a long post anyway, two very easy supplements that you can take orally daily that have proven to be effective against eczema: **Evening Primrose Oil** and **Yakult.** Evening primrose oil contains GLA, an omega-6 fatty acid that significantly reduces eczema when taken daily, and Yakult is a probiotic that supports gut health and indirectly improves skin health.\n\nI'd also advice anyone to use Shea butter/coconut oil/sunflower oil instead of the regular vaseline, as they have anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties apart from just moisturizing like vaseline.\n\nHope this helps anyone!

The reason is mainly because there is no money to be made on natural products. First of all, anyone can sell them, so it cannot be patented. Second of all, they are expensive to produce (it's much easier and standardized to mass-produce corticosteroids synthetically). This makes it so that the pharmaceutical industry has no interest in sponsoring research into these products. They are therefore not researcher enough to be used by health professionals since they are required to work evidence-based.\n\nThe sparse research that is done however paints a promising picture, one definitely worth exploring. The medical industry won't do that for us though, so we have to try for ourselves.",

I do think this may be a novel since her story starts 4 days before her birth day.\n\nMy blood pressure had been in the 140/90s the entire pregnancy. Monitoring it at home, it was much lower. The midwives were never too concerned about it since I kept a check on it at home and they could tell I was anxious at the office. At my 36 week appointment, the midwife decided to start non-stress test twice a week. \n\nAt my first non-stress test, my blood pressure stayed up. My fluid level was at a 7 so in the normal range but lower than the tech wanted. They were going to send me to Labor and Delivery Triage but the doctor on call decided that I was fine, especially since I was getting another NST in a few days. \n\nI had a bunch of questions so I paged the midwives. The midwife on call informed me that I would be induced the next week at 38 weeks. I really did not want to be given Pitocin so I tried everything I could. We had great sex, I drank red raspberry leaf tea, I took evening primrose oil, I walked, I bounced on the exercise ball, everything. But no dice.\n\nAt 37 weeks + 3 days, I had another NST. This time they did send me to triage. I was sent for my blood pressure but they decide to hook me up to the monitors just because I was there. My blood pressure quickly went in the normal range, but the nurse kept saying Just a Bit Longer. The midwife came to see me and told me that the baby was having decels. The decels were not too dramatic, but she wanted to consult the doctor to see if we should do an ultrasound to check the cord or just induce. I had been in triage for about 2.5 hours at this point so I decided to call my husband and have him join me. I had a feeling I wasn't leaving. The midwife checked me and I was 1 cm dilated, 30% effaced, and -3 station. \n\nVery quickly, my husband arrived and the midwife and doctor decided to start induction. I was admitted into the hospital and taken to a room. I'll be honest. I was mostly concerned about my dogs. We live thousands of miles away from family and majority of our friends don't have dogs. I had hired a dog sitting company to walk them, but we hadn't given them a key yet. Fortunately, the owner bent over backwards to help us, our neighbor checked on them, and my DH ran home in the evenings. Our pups were well taken care of.\n\nBack in L&D, I was given an option of a foley bulb or cytotec to open my cervix. I decided on the foley bulb. The nurse warned me to not judge my pain based on the bulb. It was extremely uncomfortable and I kept focusing on what she said because I could see my natural birth going out the window. We also started Pitocin. Once the foley bulb came out, I was great. I was hooked up to every monitor possible (which I hated) but I was out of bed and moving within the limits of my wires. The nurse said I was too smiley and bumped up the Pitocin. I actually really loved this nurse and her sense of humor. \n\nUnfortunately, Maddie was sunny side up and I started having severe back labor. I was handling it okay till my IV started hurting. It had blown out and a bubble was forming under my skin. My DH left to find a nurse. By the time they came back, it was a huge bubble. The nurse took it out and got the midwife. They couldn't tell how much pitocin was in my skin or how I would absorb it. \n\nThings got ugly from this point on. It was around 7pm. I started having 4 contractions in a row, a minute break, and repeat. All back labor. We tried different positions to try and get baby to flip, but she wasn't having it. I started begging to go home, for a break, for a bath. It was bad. The midwife said I couldn't have a bath because baby was still having decels. Instead she offered me sterile water injections in my back. She explained the gate control theory, told me it was painful, but would prevent me from feeling the back labor. I did it. I did all the shots. The midwife told me that most women can only handle 2 shots. I won't lie. I cried and almost severed my husband's hand in half. But it worked almost instantly. It was 1am at this point. I couldn't lie down because my hips hurt but I was so tired that I was literally falling asleep on my feet. \n\nThe midwife checked me and I was only 4 cm, 50% effaced, and -3. She have me 3 options. 1. Break my water but labor would intensify. 2. Start pitocin again but I was contracting by myself on a regular basis. 3. An epidural. \n\nI realized that I couldn't take anymore and most of my birth plan was thrown out anyways. I got the epidural. It was a great decision. I slept. She broke my water an hour later at 4 am. \n\nAt 7am, a new nurse came in and never left my room. She kept moving me in different positions and watching the monitor. I knew something was up. A second nurse came in a little bit after 8. I felt something in my vagina but didn't say anything because I was sure I was too numb to really feel anything. My husband was talking about taking a shower and I told him to wait. The midwife came in and started telling us that they were worried about baby so she was going to check me then we needed to discuss my options. I realized she was talking about a c section. \n\nShe checked and said, Oh we are having a baby, get the table, lets go! 15 minutes of pushing and Madelyn Leigh was born. We didn't know the gender of the baby beforehand so everyone was quiet while my husband caught her, checked her gender, and told me we had a daughter. It was a beautiful moment till someone asked me her name and I was like oh poop, does she look like a Madelyn? Ha. \n\nMaddie is 8 days old. Breastfeeding has been really easy and she is gaining weight and pooping like a champ. An induction, back labor, pitocin, hooked up to monitors, and an epidural was not part of the plan, but I got a healthy, beautiful little girl out of it and it was all worth it.",

If I had known this might happen?   I would have made dramatically different financial decisions and lived  far beneath my means so I could survive this age and stage.  I assumed I would be about SEVENTY before  I hit this dramatic dropping off of energy levels and mental stability.

Is it because I had a partial hysterectomy that was NOT elective but medically necessary?  Was it the medically necessary breast reduction that cut out all those surplus stores of estrogen in my breast tissue?  WHAT caused this?!! Has there been some huge coverup by our boomer moms?

From water breaking to birth was less than 6 hours. The pain was intense but I am glad it went as quickly as it did! I had 3 first degree tears, and an epi - needed one stitch on each \"corner\". Recovery hasn't been too bad, pooping has been perfectly normal.\n\nI posted previously about trip(s) to L&D for frequent preterm contractions. But skipping ahead - everything ended up fine! At 38 weeks I was 1 cm dilated and 70% effaced. I started drinking raspberry leaf tea, taking evening primrose oil, and bouncing on my exercise ball. At 39 weeks I was 2 cm dilated and 70% effaced, and had a membrane sweep at my apt that day. The next day and a half after the sweep I had some cramping (not sure if they were contractions but they were well spaced out by hours, and mild).\n\nOn 39+1 I did some housework, stopped by a friend's for a few minutes, and did some grocery shopping. That night after dinner I was laying down doing kick counts... when I felt a big pop! My first thought was oh that was a weird kick... But then a gush of water came and I felt silly for all the times I questioned whether I was leaking amniotic fluid lol. This was about 8p. I called L&D and they said to come right in, not to wait for contractions. I took a shower, and we got a few things together. We didn't really rush, assuming we would have a lot of time and contractions were mild. I even thought about finishing vacuuming at one point. I had 1 pretty painful contraction right before we left home. We had a 45 minute drive to the hospital. Usually the drive is an hour, but during the drive I started timing my contractions and they were between 2 and 4 minutes apart! Also they continued to get pretty painful very quickly so my husband, bless him, stepped on the gas.\n\nAs soon as we got to triage in L&D contractions started to be really intense very quickly. My memory starts to get a little fuzzy from this point on. I immediately had diarrhea... Like, with the door wide open and did not care cause my body had a mind of it's own already! They had trouble getting an IV in because I could barely stay still. I was 3cm dilated. This worried me, thinking I still had a lot of time to go as a FTM. The doctor asked me if I wanted an epidural. I always hoped to avoid it but was not 100% against it. The doctor told me I wouldn't regret it, but he wasn't pushy. I don't consider myself to have a high pain tolerance but I was really worried about side effects, the inconsistency of epidurals, and needing a catheter. My other option was IV Fentanyl so I agreed to start with that. My regular doctor had already explained to me that because Fentanyl is fast acting and short lived the baby isn't really affected by it.\n\nI made it to my room, and time from this point on seemed to kind of \"condense\". Laying on my back was incredibly uncomfortable. I instinctually wanted to be on all 4s.  I spent the next 2 hours basically with my face buried in a pillow, squeezing my husband's fingers and screaming through contractions. My contractions came in a pattern of 2 in a row and then a short break. I think I fell asleep twice during the short breaks in contractions right after receiving each Fentanyl dose. They had me rock my pelvis/hips back and forth which they said helped me dilate faster. My husband and the nurse continually reminded me to \"rock it out\" and to breath properly during contractions. It was super helpful to have my husband's voice and those 2 things to focus on through the pain fog. The nurses didn't even really ask me if I wanted an epidural again, they just said I don't think you're going to need it. There was no way I could have sat up and still long enough to get it anyway. I did have to change positons to flip onto my back to check dilation which was awful BUT I went from 3 to 5-6 cm in the hour after arriving and was at 10 about an hour after that!\n\nMy body started to push on its own which was a SUPER weird feeling. I tried to push on all 4s but that didn't feel quite right so I flipped over to my back. Suprisingly, pushing was actually much less painful than contractions! I was able to focus way more. It was really hard, but having the pain be more manageable was really key. I pushed for 40 minutes. They could see my baby's hair the whole time which was also good motivation! They asked me if I wanted to see - absolutely not. I have no interest in looking at my vagina in that state ever lol. The doctor came in at the very end and that's when I started feeling the ring of fire. Holy crap, but even that was better than the contractions because I knew I was near the end. After her head was out they had me stop pushing because the chord was wrapped around her neck. It was SO hard not to push. This is the only really disappointing part of labor for me, we didn't get delayed chord clamping because he had to cut it the get it from around her neck. After I was able to push one more time, and she was out and on my chest! She cried right away. Happily I was done with contractions and pushing. The nurse massaged my uterus to get the placenta out - OW. Also super weird to feel the placenta just kind of slime out of me. My husband said the placenta was the size of the baby and was the grossest part of the whole experience. I had 3 first degree tears, and an epi - so I needed one stitch on each \"corner\". Luckily they said those would heal pretty fast.\n\nI am now 3 days PP and recovery isn't fun but I thought it would be worse. Getting up/laying down/changing positions and especially walking SUCKED right away but after the first day is much better. I didn't expect the pressure on/from my butt when walking! Coughing and sneezing are super weird and uncomfortable. But peeing and pooping haven't hurt at all and I haven't been constipated yay! Breastfeeding so far has been the hardest part, I wasn't expecting to need an extra set of hands for that. I am in absolute awe of single parents already.",

    "body": "So. You all heard my [bitchin](http://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/sog25/who_else_had_a_procrastinatin_child/)' [and](http://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/skby2/baby_come_out/) [moanin'](http://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/su0sb/completely_freaking_out/)\n\n\nSo, here's the good part.\nOn Friday, April 27th 2012, My husband and I tok an easy morning off. We gardened and weeded and I ignored the fact that little girl hadn't yet shown up. I had been doing squats, pelvic tilts, and bouncing on my birthing ball as well as evening primrose oil all week.\n\nThat afternoon I felt a little twingey, but I resolutely ignored it and insisted we attend out friend's vows renewal. i was contracting throughout the renewal, but I had been contracting since 38 weeks and ignored that too. We talked, received mounds of advice (and told everyone we would *not* be trying castor oil thank you very much...I'd rather have pitocin than castor oil!) And we swing danced all over the floor--something we've enjoyed doing since we got married two years ago (we swung danced--swang danced? Swinged...oh whatever). This surprised quite a few of our friends, who insisted I couldn't be as pregnant as I said I was.\n\nBut I was starting to get kind of back achey, and in waves, and my tummy seemed to be constantly tight. I claimed a headache and we went home a bit early. Cuddled up in bed, rode through about three contractions and hour (nothing hard, but definitely present) and watched a few TV shows.  We were asleep by 10, as if we both knew that tomorrow would be a pretty big deal.\n\nIt was.  634am I woke up to a pretty large painy cramp, and walked around my house, called my mom and the midwives. Bounced on my birthing ball, sent out a few[ updates](http://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/swrh9/and_were_off/), and watched Doctor Who to take my mind off things. By 11am,I was feeling pretty 'good'-in that I hurt like heck and had to breath through each wave of contraction. I had some back pain. I was still rocking on my ball for the most part.\n\n So we met the midwife at 11:15, and she took one look at me and told me \"you know, if you aren't far, you'll go back home right?\"  I nodded, and apparently surprised her with how well I was coping--I was 5cm! So happy.\n\nSo into the birthing center we went. Another hour of chatting, leaning on Greg for the worst of it, drinking tea and getting music set up, and always, always boucning or rolling on that big rubber ball. My mom came at 12:30, and I was just about to step into the birthing bath.\n\n1-3 was hard hard work. I squatted in the bath for as long as I could, through each and every contraction. I was making lots of noise--but they were \"good\" noises--long and low and no swearing. I snapped at my mom once when she was reminded of the scene in Finding Nemo with the whales. Do *not* talk about whales to a lady in labor in a tub!\n\nHeat was needed for every contraction and then cold for every break--so Greg, mom and midwife Evie were kept busy alternating hot rags and cool fans, and I was busy bossing everyone around when I wasn't holding onto my boyo.  Greg was an AMAZING birth coach. He  kept my water bottle full and close beside me, put his hands right where I told them to keep the back pain down and said all the right things. He was with me every step and I could never have completed it without him. Throughout the labor, we Dopplered every 20 minutes and did a cervix check twice--Baby's heart was SO STRONG.\nShe was absolutely fantastic throughout!\n\n3:15 was transition time and that was pretty rough.   With every wave I would start off \"I can't do this, yes I can but I don't like it it HURTS\" and then go back to moaning. I tried to say things like \"open\" and \"out\" but that only felt good cause it sounded like \"ow\" which is how I felt. At one point, someone tried to make me think about flower petals opening and I snapped at them too (I know it wasn't Greg but I dunno who said it) \"No flowers, none of that crap. Pelvis opens, cervix opens. Baby comes down!\" At each break (only 30 secs between by this time) I would tell myself (in my head) 'Next time, don't start with I can't'. Yeah, that didn't happen.\n\nStarted pushing at 3:35 or so. That felt amazing--more ouch, but more than ouch, baby was coming--I could feel her!! I was so excited and pumped, and just kept right on pushing away--too fast, unfortunately. OUCH. \n\nBaby came out purple and squalling, with bright blonde hair all over her head. She took about 45 minutes just looking around the room, spent some of that time in dad's arms while I birthed the placenta (seriously, piece of cake), and got fundal massaged (ow. ow. hrmph.) Then we did a bit of breastfeeding while the midwives checked me over.\n\nHere's the unfortunate bit. because  I pushed her so quick, something snagged me on the way out, and I got a pretty gnarly set of tears--one on my perineum and one on the inside of my lady bits. What this means is that I'm still walking a bit stiff, and had to go to the hospital about two hours after Brielle was born, since the midwife wasn't comfortable stitching the perineal tear without a better look to see if it was actually rectal. (it was not, thank goodness, but it still hurt like the dickens.) So we packed the baby and I into the car and went to the hospital. Thankfully, they could do everything out patient, and stitched me up. Again, Greg was amazing through this--I know he was shell-shocked, but he held my hand and helped me position the baby for breastfeedings, effectively distracting me from my consuming need to kick the jerkface doctor in the face (she wasn't really, but that numbing stuff DID NOT WORK. Ouch.  OUCH. grr.)\n\nMom was awesome through this too, holding baby girl, taking pictures, talking to me and getting me whatever I needed, including pizza. Omnomnom, I was starving. Evie also stayed with us all the way to the hospital, wheeled me around and sweet talked the nurses. Then she came with us to our house and saw me settled in, and made sure that breastfeeding had a good start at being established.\n\nFirst night was rough. I was up every ten or twenty minutes checking on baby to make sure she was still breathing. She did get a bit chilled because it was hot when we went to bed but cold by the morning-and she and i and dad all slept from 2:30-5:45! i rushed over and brought her into bed with us, and she warmed right up. Ate for a whole hour at 6am, ate a little at 9am, and then just conked out until around 2--which made us a tiny bit worried, but she made up for it with eating like a champ from 3-6 and then again at 8.  Midwife came at 2 to check on her, and they'll be back Tuesday to see how we're doing. Currently she's sacked out with grandma, and I really should get back to her. \n\nBefore I go, Here she is:\n\n[Baby!](http://imgur.com/CBuxj)\n\nEdit to add the important bit: she is 19'', and at birth was 7lbs 11 oz. she lost 6oz her first day but with the amount she's been putting away, I would be surprised if she already gained some back. Born 4:02 4/28/12\n\n \n",

    "body": "My son is 19 months old now but since someone posted a birth center birth to encourage anyone wanting to go the natural route, I decided to share my experience and give a bit more encouragement. Our bodies are amazing and can do amazing things. We are expecting our 3rd child this September and were finally cleared for home birth again, I had partial previa and it has finally moved in the right direction. We have 9 weeks to prep for our birth and I couldn't be more excited.\n\nReference: J is my SO. A is my daughter. J-man is my son.\n\n\nExtra info: I had been drinking Red Raspberry Leaf Tea for my entire 3rd trimester. I started taking Evening Primrose Oil capsules orally at 36 weeks and vaginally at 37 weeks. We took Hypnobirthing classes as well. We were originally going to have him at a birth center but after a traumatic emergency room visit for A at around 20 weeks, she became terrified of our birth center so we found a home birth midwife at 27 weeks. I didn't want her to think that birth was scary, I wanted her to know that it is normal and beautiful and nothing to be afraid of.\n\nThe day before I had J-man I was feeling very funky. I had a lot of back pain but I was mostly fine. It wasn't anything I was really worried about. Right before bedtime I stepped into the bedroom to check my email and set up the stuff for a birth announcement to be sent out to friends and family. I was only 37 weeks, 5 days at the time so I thought I had plenty of time. A is just under 2 months shy of her 3rd birthday and she comes running in and says, \"Mom, I'm really sorry.\" I couldn't figure out what she did, I go into the living room and there is hair EVERYWHERE. She had cut some of her beautiful curls off (probably because people always point them out and she hates it). I clean up the hair and put it in a bowl to be saved, it is her first haircut after all. I get her ready for bed and play a game of League of Legends before J comes home from work. After he got home, we watched a movie and I went to bed around 12. I was so tired.\n\nI woke up at 3am to pee, everything still felt normal. Woke up at 5:30am to pee again and because my back was really starting to hurt. I busted out my handy contraction timer and got to work. I watched a movie on HBO and labored in different positions while I timed. It wasn't hurting really, it was just uncomfortable. I didn't want to wake anyone but after timing and them being 7 minutes apart and 1.5 minutes long I called my midwife and she told me to time for another hour and call her again. An hour later, everyone was still asleep and they were 5 minutes apart and 2 minutes long. This was at 7:30 am. She lives roughly an hour away so I knew she wouldn't be here right away. I also called my doula who lived close to my midwife.\n\nI hopped in the shower and then the bath and A wakes up and comes in and asked what I was doing. I said that the baby was coming and that I was taking a bath to help my back which hurt a little bit. She and I had been practicing \"singing\" the baby out. We had intended to have a support person there for her in case she wanted to leave or go in a different room but they didn't show up in time.\n\nI woke up J once A was up. He ran to get himself some coffee and then we began prepping the bed and the dining room where the birth pool would be. I helped and would stop during contractions and then continue on. It still wasn't that bad. It did finally get to a point that I couldn't get on top of them, I couldn't focus so I went into our room and put on my hypnobirthing CD and laid on the bed. I stayed like that until our midwife showed up at 9:30 a.m.\n\nShe casually walked in and asked how I was doing, I said that things were good and that the CD was helping me focus. I had stopped timing after I called her because my phone kept freezing and I was tired of dealing with it. She asked if I wanted her to check me, I agreed quickly and we discovered I was at an 8-9. Okay then. My mom wasn't going to make it (she had been driving for 2 hours, still had another 3 ahead of her) so I began frantically calling my best friend to come and be with A. She helped me work through a contraction and had me vocalize during it which REALLY helped me focus. My doula showed up and took over the support.\n\nMy midwife was no longer casual, she was running between her car and my apartment to get the pool set up. I labored on the bed for bit while they did that. My doula had be drink some water and then I started to transition. I got incredibly hot. I seriously felt like I was in a sauna. I moved to the bathroom while they finished up filling the pool, she checked me again and I was complete but had a small cervical lip. I got in the pool and while I pushed I got... loud. A completely freaked out and because her support person wasn't there yet, my midwife handed her a baby blanket and said, \"It is your job to hold this blanket, it is VERY important.\" A was completely fine after that. I pushed probably a total of 3 times before his head was out, the ring of fire is VERY TRUE. I started to say \"I can't do this\" to which my midwife just laughed at me and said \"you ARE doing this.\"\n\nI immediately pulled him up to my chest, he was amazing and wonderful. We checked to make sure he was indeed a boy and named him. His sister was so excited, she freaked a little bit at the bit of blood in the water but was too excited about J-man to really care. I handed him over to J so that he could officially introduce him to A. Someone knocked on the door and it was my best friend, 10 minutes late. He was born at 10:30 a.m. I got up and walked on my own to our bed where I was checked, I had minimal tearing and didn't require stitches thankfully. J-man was great, A was starving because in all the commotion she wasn't fed that morning... and was still in her nightgown so my best friend made everyone some breakfast.\n\nI felt great, I walked to the living room on my own, I went outside while he got cuddles with J's mom who had just showed up. A's birth was nothing like that, I didn't \"meet\" her for the first time until she was 5 minutes old (induced hospital birth with epidural) and I was incredibly tired afterwards (only a 12 hour labor). I felt fine, great, could run a marathon. I was the first person to touch him, I birthed him all on my own, I was so proud of myself for trusting my body and the process and not being afraid.\n\nBreastfeeding was rocky at first, I had one inverted nipple and one flat. We used a shield for longer than I would have liked and he self-weaned at 11 months to my devastation. 2 months later we found out we were pregnant again. It wasn't planned and was prevented in almost every way possible but oh well. I was going to get an IUD after J-man was born but was hospitalized to have my gall bladder removed for a week and couldn't make my appointment and when I got out of the hospital and done with recovery my insurance had gone out. It was a horrible week of pumping (mad props to pumping moms, that crap is hard) and my daughter wouldn't come see me without screaming. She missed me though and came anyway. She brought prizes too and she still plays with the stuffed turtle she gave me.\n\nA remembers the entire birth. All of it. She is very excited about the next one, she wants to cut the cord. Some people would find it weird that we let her be present but it was her choice. She could have gone to her room if she wanted to, she didn't. She wanted to be there. She talks about how my midwife is going to catch her babies.\n\nOh and my doula was also working on getting certified for placenta encapsulation so she took mine and did her thing. I still have half a jar leftover but will be doing it again this time. I had horrible PPD with A (I also didn't breastfeed her from lack of support and education) and while I still had some PPD with J-man it wasn't nearly as severe.\n\nSome pictures.\nhttp://imgur.com/a/Ztuca",

    "body": "I am 38 and have endo since puberty, so more than 20 years.  There are so many things I wish someone had told me at the start of this journey.  I wanted to write this post to share all my advice in the hope that this will help someone else out there, and save you from having to learn this the hard way, like I did.  \n\nBackground: I have stage IV endo and have had four laparoscopies to remove it.  I've also had large cysts, and one was the size of an orange and had to be surgically removed.  At age 38, after dealing with this disease for so long, my pain levels are now SO much better, and I managed to have two healthy children.  I have spent a fortune consulting all kinds of doctors and natural therapists and I have tried almost everything. \n\nHere are all my tips!\n\n* When you have an ultrasound try to find a clinic where the person who performs the ultrasound is actually an obstetrician/gynacologist, not just a sonographer.  It's worth the extra money. \n* Find the best endometriosis surgeon in your city, and go to them.  Don't muck around with the ones who aren't specialists. \n* If you need surgery, you need surgery and no amount of diets/supplements/natural therapies will get rid of the endo that's already there.  The natural therapies can help to reduce pain and keep your whole body as healthy as it can be, but if you already have endo in there than you need a surgeon to cut it out.   You need a scalpel!  Let them cut it all out, then use the natural therapies to heal, reduce inflammation, reduce pain, and help slow the rate at which it cuts back.\n* Don't go on the pill.  (Obviously this helps some people, but not others, and if you're like me, all that oestrogen will create so much inflammation and just end up making it worse, plus you get all the side effects).  When I was young I went to doctors I thought were fine, but their basic advice was to just take painkillers and go on the Pill.  This is terrible advice and it will not heal you! \n* Eat an anti inflammatory diet.  Stop eating rubbish like artificial colouring, flavouring, and preservatives.  Cut out gluten, and reduce your consumption of dairy, alcohol, and refined sugar.  Eat lots of vegetables, protein, whole gluten-free grains (brown rice, quinoa etc), fruits, nuts and seeds.  \n* Take fish oil (it's anti inflammatory) every night with dinner, and evening primrose oil instead with dinner while you have your period, because the fish oil creates more bleeding.\n* Try seed cycling.  In the first 14 days of your cycle, add 1 tablespoon pepita seeds and 1 tablespoon of linseeds to your breakfast.  In the second 14 days, instead add 1 tablespoon of sesame seeds and 1 tablespoon of sunflower seeds.  Supposedly the seeds support your hormones, and they do contain protein, essential fatty acids, and nutrients.  During your period, use chia seeds instead because they're anti inflammatory.  Drink a cup of warm water with it because the seeds swell and it's great fibre.\n* Add lots of fibre to your diet to help your bowels.  Every morning start your day with a small cup of water mixed with slippery elm powder, which soothes the lining of your bowel.  Eat vegetables every day with lunch.  Google psyllium husk cookies recipe and eat one every afternoon with a cup of warm water.  As soon as your period starts, take a laxative tablet that night.  It will make your bowel movement the next morning less painful, and by clearing out the bowel, your bowel will sit flatter and you won't have its contents pressing on your endo adhesions and causing pain.  This is a simple thing that REALLY helps reduce my pain levels when I have my period. \n* Exercise 30 minutes every day! Find something you like, and do that.  I used to roll my eyes at this and think exercise is not going to cure me, but keeping your whole body healthy HELPS and will help with reducing inflammation and pain, and stimulating all your lymph system, circulation etc, plus it's good for your mental health. \n* Look up chronic pain tips, and apps like Curable.  I think you need to deal with the physical problem of endo that's causing pain, and you can't just rely on trying to change your mental perception of pain, but the chronic pain tips will help you deal with the pain when it's there.  Also try to meditate every day and do a guided full body relaxation once a week.\n* When you get pain, sit in a hot bath with magnesium.  Take the painkillers but try to take the minimum amount that gives you relief, and always with food so you don't hurt your stomach. \n* When you have your period, cancel as many things as possible.  I always used to push myself through and this was a mistake.  Cancel what you can, rest as much as you can on those days, and go to bed early those days. \n\nMy tips on your attitude and dealing with this disease:\n\n* Accept that you have this.  Don't just push yourself through it and try to suffer through the pain and get on with your life like I did.  Accept it.  You have it.  And you have to treat yourself with kindness, and be your own best friend.  I used to think that ignoring it and pushing myself through it was the best way to stop it interfering with my life, but really, if I had treated myself better, I would have had less pain, and then I would have missed out on less.\n* There is nothing wrong with you and it is not your fault.  It's not because you ate something wrong or did something wrong or are a wuss and can't cope with pain. \n* You have it, so how can it make you stronger? What can you learn from this? What can you learn about yourself from this?\n* Remember, \"comparison is the thief of joy.\"  Don't compare yourself to your friends who don't have endo, and are out there hiking or working or partying while they have their period.  \n* When you have your period or you have pain, rest.  If you need to take time off studying or working, do it.  I wish I had. \n* There is hope! Don't give up.  I know the pain is terrible.  When I was in my 20s I would faint or vomit from the pain because the pain was so strong.  But now, I am so much better!  It can get better!!! This is your body, no one else's, and only you know how it feels, and you are responsible for yourself and your health and your life, no one else.  Use the doctors and natural therapies etc to help you, but they're there to help you, they're not in charge, you are.  \n\nI hope this helps someone out there!",

    "body": "So I’m finally getting to share my birth story and to start off I want to say I didn’t have a set birth plan and thankfully I didn’t! Nothing went how I could have expected and I went in with the mindset that I would make informed decisions on the day. I’m a FTM, never been through labour before, didn’t know how my body would react to even try to make any firm decisions prior.\nAfter 9 months of everyone and anyone telling me I wouldn’t make my due date, there I was at 41+3 getting prepped for induction after trying every natural induction method you can think of. Raspberry leaf tea, evening primrose oil, walking, curry, pineapple, yoga ball and even FOUR membrane sweeps.\nAnyway, I arrived at the hospital with cervidil inserted at 5pm. I was told I might have some cramping overnight and would be checked the next morning to see how much I had progressed. The midwife would be in and out during the night to check my blood pressure. I was prescribed 2 panadol by my midwife on my chart for during the night if the cramping got too much and was told to let the midwife on duty know if/when I needed it. I was encouraged to take it if the cramping stopped me from sleeping. My midwife wanted me to get some sleep in preparation for what would be a long day the next day.\nMy husband stayed until 10pm, went home and was told to come back for 6am in the morning. I tried to get some sleep. I fell asleep at approx 11.30pm and woke at 12.30 am with cramping. Walked around my room, to the toilet etc. but the “cramps” were getting stronger and stronger. At 3.30am I asked for the panadol remembering my midwife would be back to check me at 6am and I hadn’t had any sleep yet with nearing 24 hours awake. Called the midwife she said no problem they would need to strap me up to check baby before giving it to me, she went to get the monitor. She came back, I sat up in the bed and my water broke all over the bed at 3.30am. She checked baby, all was good and it was showing I was having regular and strong contractions. Rang my husband as soon as my water broke to come back to the hospital.\n6am rolls around and I’m moved up to the birthing unit, syntocin drip is started straight away. I laboured for hours, used the yoga ball and tens machine. After 10 hours of constant and regular contractions (6/7 one minute contractions in 10 mins) I asked for the epidural. I had it placed about an hour later and oh sweet relief!! I actually started to sleep at one stage after that. I was checked regularly and was progressing well.\n\nHere’s where things turned.\nDuring the day I was drinking regularly and had 4 bags of fluid through an IV. I hadn’t passed so much as a drop of urine all day. The urine bag inserted didn’t even have enough for the midwives to do a urine sample. They changed the size of the catheter, the bag twice and no luck. I started to become really unwell. My temperature went through the roof, suddenly 2 doctors were in the room. One checking my progression - I was 9cm, while the other checked the readings from the monitor. Ben’s heart rate was escalating very quickly. My husband was rubbing me down with ice cold water. I was pumped with antibiotics, nothing worked. I tried a few practice pushes and they tried to stretch me to 10cm but to no avail. A decision was made for an emergency c-section. Apparently I was at risk of septicaemia.\nSuddenly the room filled with staff and my husband was standing in front of me in full scrubs. I burst into tears.\nWheeled in to theatre, things moved very quickly and suddenly we would hear this huge loud cry as the curtain dropped to show us our beautiful baby boy! We both burst into tears!\nI sent my husband with him. There was a paediatrician waiting for Ben. His temperature was really high and my husband was told if his temperature didn’t come down he would need to go to NICU. Thankfully it came down. Our baby was weighted and I was told we was a whopping 4.5kgs/10lbs! We never ever expected to have a baby that big. I didn’t have GD and I’m quite petite, 60kgs/5’2 before pregnancy.  I lost a lot of blood turning surgery and started to vomit while being stitched up. \nWe moved to recovery, Ben latched fantastically and eventually we were moved to the maternity ward. I had antibiotics every 4 hours for 4 days. \nI was then told I had an obstructed labour because of Ben’s size and although I was 9cm dilated he was never going to come naturally and my next pregnancy will be monitored a lot more closely for the size of baby.\nWe went home on day 5. Recovery has been going well. He is the most amazing little boy, absolutely thriving! I could burst with love every time I look at him! I never realised the love I feel for him. He is just perfect in every single way! As for my husband, I never thought I could love him anymore than I did. Well, I was wrong! He was an absolute rock the whole way through the pregnancy, never missed one appointment or prenatal class, was a pillar or support during a very difficult labor and delivery, postpartum and seeing him be the most amazing father to our son fills my heart with love. I love him more than I ever thought I could!\nIt was all worth it, and I would do it all again in a heartbeat for my little man! 💙\n\n \n",

    "body": "First, thanks to everyone who has posted their birth stories! They have been an addiction of mine! Hopefully some of you will enjoy my story!\n\nAt 38 weeks, I started all sort of things to speed up labor- acupuncture, raspberry leaf tea, pumping once a day for 10 minutes, and evening primrose oil. I was not going to be induced. :) Not sure if any of these actually worked, but hey, it probably didn't hurt!\n\nStarted having period like cramps and intermittent nausea a full 10 days before labor started. We were on pins and needles the whole time. At 40+1 my water broke at 5am when I woke up to go to the bathroom and contractions started immediately. They weren’t too intense and I timed them for a while, so we called the nurses line, and they recommended laboring at home. I figured this would be my last chance for a while to shower, so I hopped in the shower, and boom, the contractions got much more intense. It was about time for rush hour, and I was not okay with the idea of being stuck in traffic, so we left pretty quickly for the hospital after that. \n\nGot to the hospital about 7:15a and was directed to triage. At that point my contractions were so intense, and I was getting scared. I wanted a natural birth, but knew I was not going to be able to deal with that level of pain for very long. And my contractions were back to back, like a minite apart. \n\nAll of a sudden, I had to poop- and really badly! I told my husband to get the nurse so I could get off the monitors to go poop. We were still waiting for my midwife who was a 20 minute drive from the hospital... My nurse and the OBGYN came in and argued about whether or not to let me poop (doctor was worried I'd give birth on the toilet), and the nurse won, so I went to the bathroom. Turns out, couldn't poop. Push and pushed and nothing happened...\n\nMidwife gets there, checks me, and I'm fully dialated. At that point, I couldn't believe it. I just burst into tears of relief knowing that I was so close. Within 10 minutes, my husband says he can see her head which was a huge motivator. Pushing stalled out for probably 30 minutes so I ended up getting an episiotomy, and baby Jane was delivered minutes after at 9:15. She \nwas so peaceful, too. She did the required wailing within a minute of birth, but after that, her eyes were wide open and she just kept looking around. \n\nIt was so quick, I couldn’t believe it. I consider myself insanely lucky with how it went. I did need \"an extensive repair\" job down there since I had 2nd degree tears in all directions, plus the repair for the episiotomy. That definitely left me hobbling for the first 2 weeks, but I'm almost 3 weeks out now and feel pretty close to normal. Dermoplast spray is a life saver. \n\nThe first few poops were terrible, but I should have been better at keeping up with the stool softeners. If I could go back I would have used something stronger (like a gentle laxative) the day after birth. I ended up needing multiple suppositories which was unpleasant. \n\nLast words for anyone that is still reading- breast feeding is f-ing hard. I was not prepared for the amount of pain and time involved. My baby had a tongue tie, which complicated matters, but wow it's been a rough few weeks. After 3 appointments with a lactation consultant, it's getting better, and it looks like we'll be able to keep it up. But it has definitely been a struggle! My heart goes out to all women who have had trouble breastfeeding!\n\nPhotos!\n\nOn her birthday and 2 weeks later\nhttp://i.imgur.com/npyo88w.jpg\nhttp://i.imgur.com/svl0NjW.jpg\n\nThanks for reading! May you all have beautiful and healthy birth stories!\n\nEdit: Imgur links were broken...",

    "body": "So, this is a topic that I have been researching over the past 6 months. After 5 years of trying all different hormonal birth control options ever existing, I decided to get a copper IUD and got my menstrual cycle back. The first year I did not have my period, which was great, because no hormones and no period! However, when my period came back I noticed something in my mental health changing. I want to share my experiences with you to create more awareness for **PMDD**, and how it is closely relate to neurodivergence such as **ADHD** and **ASD**.\n\n*\\*Possible TW for my PMDD symptoms in this paragraph. If you don't want any details, please skip\\**  \nEvery month during the same exact week (my cycle is about 30 days), I get into an instant depression. All my traumas come back at me and I cannot let them go, I get super anxious and walk around in fight-or-flight mode all the time. I barely sleep. All the choices that I make in life seem to be the worst and I basically just want to give up on everything. If someone treats me bad, I cannot handle it. I cannot let go of anything. I do not want to get out of bed. I cry all the fucking time. I start to hate myself as a person. Nothing that I do seems to be good enough. Other things that happen is that I want to binge eat, I crave sugar, caffeine, alcohol and all the bad stuff. I make very bad and impulsive decisions which I then hate myself for again. Also, I am not able to focus or think straight. I have to stay home from work and I cannot even focus on a screen which makes studying impossible.\n\nThere is a [difference](https://iapmd.org/pmdd-v-pme) between PME and PMDD. For PMDD, you should have these symptoms only coming up during your luteal phase and they should not be present at any other time in your cycle. For PME, the symptoms are there during your whole cycle, but get stronger during your pre-menstrual phase. This happens for example, when you are in a depression or have an anxiety disorder. I feel like both are very likely to be present for people with AuDHD or one of them, since mental health issues are more present. However, for me I found out that it really is PMDD.\n\nI've also read that neurodivergent people are more sensitive for hormones in general, but especially the rise and fall of progesterone and estrogen (which is what happens during your luteal phase). There is a real lack of research on PMDD for people with ASD and ADHD. For me, the PMDD symptoms already start in my ovulation phase and end 3-4 days before I have my period (at least I have some time to recover before my period starts...) This is how I found out that it is the fall of progesterone and estrogen around day 20 of your cycle is my trigger (which is officially still viewed as your ovulation phase). So, the trigger for me is not the complete luteal phase which many doctors and professors suggest for people with PMDD.\n\nTracking your cycle is something I would recommend everyone. I was also never educated on hormones and how they influence you during your cycle. Knowing what is happening to your body and mind, your energy, your thoughts, the food you take in, was very crucial for me into changing my lifestyle.\n\nThere are options to treat PMDD of which the main are: 1) hormonal birth control, 2) antidepressants, and 3) chemical menopause. However, we should consider that we as neurodivergent people are more sensitive for hormones (which is probably why some of us struggle with PMDD in the first place). That is why I had to quit all hormonal birth control options, since the side effects were making me mentally and physically sick. I have not tried the chemical menopause, but there is a huge chance that people with PMDD have a more intense response to menopause, so you would introduce a new problem for the old problem. Antidepressants are for me a choice that I do not want to make, since I am more into natural and alternative medicine, so I do not have experiences with this. If any of you have experience in these 3 options, I would love to hear!\n\nSome alternative medicine that I have read about or tried myself are:  \n\\-Agnus Castus: supports the hormone balance and has had very positive effects to treat PMS  \n\\-Evening primrose oil: supports hormone balance as well, and has positive effects on PMS, but is not offically registered like agnus castus so might not work as good for everyone  \n\\-Rhodiola Rosa: helps to reduce stress during PMDD symptoms  \n\\-Ginseng: helps to reduce stress and gives you more energy without anxious side effects  \n\\-Gingko Giloba: supports the brain to increase concentration and memory during brain fog  \n\\-GABA supplement: neurotransmitter that helps calming down negative and anxious thoughts and improves sleep - I take 3 a day during my PMDD symptoms  \n\\-Valerian: reduces anxiety and makes you sleepy\n\nOther things that support me are:  \n\\-Weighted blanket, 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes in the evening  \n\\-Yoga nidra to calm down my thoughts and help me being less tired  \n\\-Walking or a short work-out, especially when you don't feel like it  \n\\-Hobbies or special interests that get you into the FLOW state, so you do not have to focus on negative thoughts\n\nI feel like the biggest reason that I am still regularly in therapy after 1,5 years is because of my PMDD symptoms and I wish there would be more knowledge available. Anyhow, I am super interested in PMDD within our community and how other people experience this. I also hope I can help people diagnose themselves after reading this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre there more women/AFABs/trans women/people who menstruate here that experienced the same and want to share their experiences?",

        "body": "YES! \n\nI have ADHD (suspected ASD) and my symptoms begin in ovulation. I relate to your symptoms too. I went on a low dose of SSRIs throughout my whole cycle which helped a lot, but its still hard. \n\nTbh I think it has a lot to do with the fact that society is so fast paced and not built for neurospicy folks combined with the fact that we are supposed to be RESTING during our periods.\n\nWe are not designed to be working in such a gruelling rat race let alone when our body is going through these complex processes and literally bleeding out. Its ludicrous. IMO PMDD is actually kind of a trauma response, a reaction to our boundaries and needs being violated. \n\nThat being said, I do treat it because I am stubborn and I won't let the system get me down. Whatever help I am offered, I'll take it. The pill took away my libido and my whole creative personality ( basically everything good in life lol) so never again - but low dose fluoxetine (prozac, lovan) seems to numb it enough for me. \n\nWith the SSRI, because i normally feel so intensely, I probably now feel emotional sensations closer to a neurotypical amount so at least I can a) still recognise my pain so I can honor my needs and b) think with a clearer head and look after my life a bit more. \n\nAlso, weed. Yes I am on day 1 right now, and I am so tired. Sorry you've been through this too and thanks so much for the info provided <3\n\nEdit P.S Another alternative to antidepressants (would not recommend taking antidepressants on and off - that was a rollercoaster) is a supplement called 5-HTP. (Which you can take just in the second half of your cycle if you want! You don't have to taper)\n\n5-HTP is a precursor to serotonin and it helped me immensely.\nI am interested to look into GABA because if I understand correctly, value and related anxiolytics are supposed to work with GABA, and they are extremely effective (but unfortunately addictive).",

They technically can not have PMDD, however can experience very similar symptoms - so if they are very sensitive to hormonal changes because of also being Neurodivergent, they will have a hellish time just like us AFABs.

I started to notice a week to week and a half before my period actually starts I would go through early what you described. I would feel intense, irritable, restless, anxious. Insomnia is the biggest give in that week because I can't sleep well to save my life. I already struggle outside of that week so within that week?

        "body": "I have a hormonal IUD and rarely get \"real\" periods, just all the fun hormonal symptoms with no blood and not quite as much cramping as I used to have, so it took me forever for it to click that my symptoms were linked to my cycle. I spent years trying to get my mood under control with meds, switching up the cocktails every few months, but it was always the same pattern where my mood would improve and we'd all assume it was because of the meds and then it would get worse and doc would switch my meds again. I realized something was up when I quit meds cold turkey (which I do not recommend!) and started tracking my mood daily. Once I was through the withdrawal period, I noticed my mood was still following the exact same up-and-down pattern it had when I was on meds.....and that this pattern was repeating roughly once every 4 weeks. \n\nNow that I'm aware of the pattern, it's so obvious, I can't believe I never noticed it before. I basically become a completely different person in the days leading up to my period I'm probably on around day 4 of my cycle right now, so I feel great and normal, but last week I was having a crisis because my partner and I spent hundreds of dollars on tickets for a concert this summer and my hormones had me convinced I didn't like this band anymore an we'd wasted all that money on a concert I wouldn't enjoy. Now that hell week's over, music sounds good again and I'm back to dancing around the house with songs I love on repeat. I'm also really into books and set reading goals for myself every day and I've noticed that I have never once completed my goals on ovulation day or day 1 of my cycle. I also consistently rate books I read during hell week lower than other books. \n\nI've got the variation where I get symptoms around ovulation, some improvement, and then a slow increase in symptoms until around day 1 and then symptoms decrease pretty quickly over the next few days. My ovulation symptoms are usually a bit different than my period symptoms. I usually get extreme fatigue and brain fog and often end up just resting in front of the TV all day and picking up takeout for dinner. I can ovulate as early as day 10 of my cycle, so some months I only really get 1 normal week, which sucks major dick, but knowing when I'm in a deep depression that if I wait just 3 or 4 more days I'll get some relief really helps me push through when I'm feeling like I've always felt this way and will always feel this way. Knowing that the cycle will repeat can make me feel a bit hopeless though. \n\nMy premenstrual symptoms tend to be a lot more chaotic than my ovulation symptoms. Around ovulation I just feel like I'm missing something I usually have (energy, excitement, cognitive skills, etc.). Before my period, everything bad gets worse. My chronic pain flares, my anxiety flares, my gender dysphoria flares and I get urges to mutilate my own body. I hate everything, I'm irritable and prone to snapping over minor things. I have to be very mindful of how I'm feeling and the warning signs that I might go off on my partner or cats and remove myself from the situation. Sometimes I feel like I don't love them anymore. I think the worst of everyone around me, everything they do is horrible and wrong and done just to spite me and I have to stop and do a reality check and remind myself I probably won't feel that way once my hormones settle. I cry in the shower. I cry in bed. I cry because I watched a funny movie, but it was too funny and now I'm overwhelmed. I cry because I read a sexy fanfic, but it was too sexy and now I'm overwhelmed and also dysphoric. \n\nI'm not sure if I it would be considered PMDD or PME for me, since I'm pretty sure I definitely have underlying issues that are exacerbated, but there's also a lot of symptoms I don't have otherwise or that show up even if I'm treating the underlying issue. I'm diagnosed with MDD and low-level depression used to be my \"baseline\", with moderate depression as my winter normal and of course the severe depressive episodes related to my cycle. But then I was diagnosed with vitamin-D deficiency and as long as I take my vitamins, I feel quite happy during the warmer months and adding in sunlight therapy in the winter has my winter normal at around where my summer normal used to be. I can also get quite obsessive/compulsive during hell week and those symptoms don't entirely disappear after my period, but I don't think they impact me enough to qualify for an OCD diagnosis. I'm hoping to get in to see some kind of specialist soon, but it's been crazy hard to get appointments in my province since COVID started and with all the healthcare budget cuts and now my doctor's injured her back and can't come into the office, so everything that's not \"high-priority\" keeps getting pushed back. \n\nI find CBD gummies help a bit with the anxiety and catastrophizing. I take 20mg in the evening most nights to help me relax anyway, but often around my period I will take an extra half or whole gummy and lots of valerian tea for the insomnia. I used to take ativan as needed, but I find I build up a tolerance so quickly that CBD ends up being just as effective pretty quickly, plus I always get nasty rebound anxiety and depression after taking one, so it's rarely worth it.",

I stumbled upon the usual references on their page and read the mentioned journals. They were pretty useless. I was expecting more of scientific results published for the ingredients, but what I found were useless journals that doesn't really say anything.\n\nhttps://m.imgur.com/ERvD0iH\n\nThe one on reference 4 states: \"Biophysical skin parameters are indicators of age-related structural and functional changes in skin tissues. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy adults tested the effect of Efamol evening primrose oil [EPO, a gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) containing vegetable oil] on skin moisture, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), redness, firmness, elasticity, fatigue resistance and roughness. Efamol EPO was administered orally in soft gel capsules, 3 × 500 mg b.i.d. for 12 weeks.\"\n\nDid you see that? The reference talks about the effectivity of Evening Primrose Oil (which is the main ingredient in Skin Renewing Line). However, the study mentions that the EPO was ADMINISTERED ORALLY. Don't get me wrong, a lot of research show that EPO is good for the skin. It's just that it is ridiculous that they would cite a journal that references oral administration. I just hate it when they use bad science as a marketing tool.

Just thought I was having panic attacks or anxiety and did not even think to connect it to COVID. I started feeling better in January, 2022, so I got the Pfizer booster. Approx 7-8 hours after the booster, I had my first horrible case of resting tachycardia which never went away. Would have Low/High BP throughout the day, resting HR would spike if I would stand up or walk short distances. Adrenaline dumps would occur after each meal, I only ever felt normal when I woke up in the mornings and was on an empty stomach. As soon as I had the first meal, my body went crazy - sweating, racing heart, nausea, anxiety, felt like crying for no reason (you name it, I had it). I experienced extreme dizziness and vertigo at random periods throughout the day. The room would be spinning all the time, the walls kept moving further and further away. I experienced bouts of SOB where I would keep yawning or taking deep breaths but feeling like I could not catch air, or get enough oxygen to satisfy my body’s needs. I had horrible bladder issues, and UTI symptoms with no UTI: nocturia, frequency, urgency, and burning sensation in bladder (which is associated with POTS). After some testing, I was diagnosed with dysautonomia and POTS. Structurally, my heart looked completely normal (post echocardiogram). I can say from January to now, I have gotten much better. I am not at 100%, but I would like to share what I have learned so far so maybe I can help someone else in a small way. \n\n**Diet** \n\n* At this point, I still continue a diet of **no sugar, no caffeine, no alcohol**. Eliminate fried food, less eating out, no processed foods/ready made meals. All the meals I made, I would cook from scratch with fresh ingredients. This helped me feel better, and have more energy to continue throughout the day. \n* Gut dysbiosis is not talked about enough. Fix your gut health and many of your pre-existing conditions will ameliorate and some of the smaller issues will entirely go away. Since I was not on a low-histamine diet, I make my own homemade kefir with full fat milk, and drink a glass a day. I started to notice improvements within 2-3 weeks with heart palpitations, racing heart, thudding heart. My bowel movements were more consistent as well. \n\n**Supplements Daily Doses:** \n\n* Magnesium Glycinate (100mg x 2), Fish Oil (720mg Omega 3), Evening Primrose Oil (2000mg), Vitamin D (1000 IU), Zinc (30mg), Vitamin B12, CoQ10 (100mg), Psyllium Husk Powder (1 tablespoon), Nuun Sport Electrolyte Tablet (1 tablet) \n\n**Lifestyle Changes** \n\n* **Minimum of 8 hours sleep a night.** If I did not get enough sleep, the next day I would have heart palpitations, thudding heart, racing heart. I would feel depressed, exhausted and dizzy, and it would be much harder to get through the day.\n* **1 Gallon of water a day**. Aggressive hydration helps with POTS symptoms, which I experience \n* **Electrolytes.** Adding electrolytes to my routine helped greatly with the palpitations and somewhat regulating spikes in resting HR. I think my electrolyte balance was off \n* **Exercise.** ***(DISREGARD THIS IF YOU SUFFER FROM PEM/ME/CFS)***. I had the general fatigue associated with COVID-19 longhaul, but did not have PEM/CFS/ME so I was able to tolerate exercise well. I found exercise helps me to regulate my HR and improve my mood. COVID impacts the part of the brain that triggers anxiety (Limbic system) and then the nervous system which controls the adrenaline dumping associated with fight-or-flight response. Exercise helped with my anxiety and depression, when done in moderation. You need to be careful not to overdo it because I felt good in the moment, but if I overdid it, I would get a horrible case of fatigue and resting tachycardia like 3-4 hours later. Again, exercise is a controversial topic on this sub, but I just want to say it helped me a lot, so be cautious how you move forward with exercise because it can seriously set you back, or help you improve. A graduated exercise program can be recommended in this case, start with walking, and then jogging, eventually you will be running again. The main point is, do not overexert, take it slow. \n* **AliveCor Kardia EKG Machine.** This little device helped a lot with my health anxiety. When I would get attacks of resting tachycardia, I would take an EKG reading only to see it was just “sinus tachycardia” and everything was normal. This helped me to calm down. One time, I did get PVCs but my cardiologist told me that mine are benign. All in all, if something is really wrong this EKG machine can detect AFib and you can use those results to be taken more seriously by your doctor - a lot of us are victims of gaslighting with doctors saying our issues are just AnXiEtY when it’s not. This device might help you build a case, if the results are abnormal. For me, it helped with the anxiety. \n* **Apple Watch Users, STOP checking your HR constantly.** I noticed when I started to really get better, I would check my HR less frequently. This was hard at first, but I forced myself to stop checking my HR on my Apple Watch, it only made me more anxious or scared (even if my HR was low??). Just the act of constantly checking made me a nervous wreck, so breaking this habit allowed me to feel less on edge constantly.",

    "body": "I can't believe I'm about to unsubscribe from babybumps. I've loved it here! But my littlest boy is about 8 weeks, and it's time to move on! Hopefully I'll be back in about a year with #3! I really loved reading the birth stories on here so for anyone similar, here's ours! \n\nThis is soooooo long; I included all the details.. There's a tldr; at the end. I won't blame you for skipping to it. Lol. \n\nI'll start by saying that my delivery with my older son was a shit show. It was an induction after a stalled labour. 17 hours long. OB, epidural, episiotomy, vacuum assisted delivery, fourth degree tear, no \"informed consent\" about medical procedures being performed, pushy MIL with no boundaries, ptsd, and ppd. Traumatic, exhausting, painful, scary. Long recovery.  \n\nBecause my first labour and delivery was so hard and I lost trust in OBs/hospitals, I opted for a midwife. I wanted a home birth so we extensively looked into whether it was safe after a previous fourth degree tear and since I had a low risk pregnancy and it was a very small risk of tearing again, we planned for me to deliver at home! Knowing I would be in my own home took away almost all my anxiety and I was genuinely excited to give birth this time. I really wanted to experience it all. Even the pain wasn't intimidating. It would be my space with my rules. My midwives listened to my concerns about my last birth and talked to me about options. I really felt like they heard me and I really trusted them. That was important to me. \n\nI had a very simple birth plan. No drugs, at home, let my body tell me what needs to happen, and hands off as much as possible. I was just going to let nature take its course, deal with the pain, and figure things out as we go. I figured I would know what I needed to do. \n\nStarting at about 36 weeks I was having Braxton hicks contractions every day, but not regularly. I'd have a few then nothing again for hours. On Mother's Day (about 37-ish weeks) I remember having some pretty intense contractions in the car on the way home and thought \"this might be it\" but they stopped as soon as I got out of the car again. I was getting so impatient waiting for these fake contractions to turn into the real thing. But most days I'd have a few bouts of uncomfortable contractions that would go away again. Just enough to tease me. Lol. \n\nI saw my midwife at about 39 weeks and we confirmed again that everything was good. We talked about how impatient I was getting and I asked for tips to encourage labour to start. They told me that people had some success with evening primrose oil. I had my husband pick some up that evening! I inserted one pill the first night, two pierced pills the next two nights, and then I was in labour! \n\nThe night before I went into labour I couldn't really sleep, as usual. I was so sore and my contractions were keeping me up. They weren't painful really, just uncomfortable. I noticed them just enough to keep me awake, but not enough to alarm me. So I stayed in bed tossing and turning like every other night that month. At about 4am I decided that they were getting pretty strong and they start coming in a consistent pattern. I woke up my husband and we timed them. They were a minute long, about 3-4 minutes apart! We called the midwife at about 5am. She listened to me and decided she would get up and ready to come check me out even though she said it sounded like I would still be a few hours still, but to call 911 if I felt the need to push before she got there. \n\nSo it's 5am, and I can feel the contractions, but they're nowhere near painful, especially not like in the movies. So we sent our older son and the dog off to my MIL's, called the rest of the parents, sent a text out to close friends and emailed my husband's work to let everyone know it was happening. \n\nBy 5:15 the contractions begin to be on the painful end of uncomfortable, and then suddenly around 5:30 I'm in real pain. I'm doubled over and can barely speak through the contractions so my husband calls back the midwife to tell her things are moving quickly. While he's on the phone he comes in and notices I'm bleeding (which apparently is NOT a cause for concern.. although seeing blood under me on the bathroom floor is not comforting). She says she's leaving and should be about 30 minutes. For some reason I decide if be most comfortable sitting on the toilet. In hindsight I realize this is when I started getting a bit of an urge to push, and I think my brain went, hey! this feels kinda like you need to poop. you do that on the toilet. \n\nAt a few minutes to 6am I remember that I've read stories where women say getting in a warm tub or shower soothed them and lessened the pain of contractions. At this point I can barely see straight so I get in the shower. Well go figure this makes them way worse. They're so painful I'm literally screaming in the shower. I call my husband over and tell him to call 911. I definitely want to push, but can still stop myself. The midwives aren't here yet. A friend of mine delivered her baby by herself with her husband because her midwives didn't get there in time, so I keep telling myself that I can do this alone if I have to. While my husband is on the phone with 911 dispatch the midwife calls back to say she's close and see how I'm progressing. She talks me through some contractions while I'm laying in the shower because the pain is too intense for me to move on my own. She tries to stop me from screaming through the pain since I guess it doesn't help. I didn't really have much control. The noise just came from my body without warning. \n\nWhen she knew EMS was on the way and she was close she hung up and my husband stayed with me and panicked quietly since there wasn't much he could do for me. Plus there was a small chance he was going to have to catch our baby if no one arrived on time. Lol. \n\nMy midwives showed up about 5 minutes before EMS at about 6:15. I've been in real, active labour for about 2 hours and 15 minutes at this point. The midwives and my husband rush around to prep the bedroom for delivery (thank god I had most of it together before!) while the paramedics helped me out of the shower between contractions. I shuffled over to the bedroom feeling like my baby was going to fall out and  ungracefully crawled up onto my unreasonably high bed. I was already exhausted so when I ended up with my face down and my ass in the air (I don't think we'll be doing it doggy style for a while). I decided that I was going to just deliver like that. Midwives were happy so I was happy. My contractions were less painful like that - awesome! They checked me quick and told me I could push whenever I felt my next contraction. \n\nWhat sweet relief. As soon as I started pushing the pain was back down to very tolerable levels. I mean, it was super uncomfortable, and the \"ring of fire\" is no joke, but I felt in control of the pain. I could handle it and knew I was safe and progressing the way I should. I think I was in so much pain before because it was so sudden. That, mixed with the sight of a lot of my blood on the floor, freaked me out and I panicked, which made me tense up even worse. Stay calm, ladies!!\n\nMy water still hadn't broken, so after a few pushes it started protruding out from my body, and they broke it manually then. It relieved so much pressure. So I pushed and pushed until the head came down and started to crown. I could feel myself tearing. Again, I started to panic, remembering my severe tear from last time. So we switched positions to relieve pressure from that area. I was on my side for a couple pushes so there was no pressure on my perineum and scar tissue, but it was too distracting to keep my leg up like that, so I moved onto my back. It only took a few more slow, controlled pushes and our baby was born! \n\nA baby boy! He was put right on my chest, which was both amazing and disgusting. Lol.  His older brother was taken and cleaned up at the hospital before I saw him, so it was incredible to get to hold him right away still gooey and slimy and fresh. \n\nFinley Alexander was born at 7:12am weighing 9lb 1oz, after a 3 hour 15 minute labour and about 45 minutes of pushing.\n\nSomehow I had a pain free labour until I was fully in the transition stage. I had read that the transition stage is when most women give up and it's the worst part right before you start pushing. I wish I had remembered that then. It might've brought me some comfort to know its a normal phase and it means I'm almost done (even though I had just started!) \n\nI ended up with two first degree tears on either side, on the insides of my labia, up closer to the top. Those were the tears I felt while pushing. I also had a second degree tear on my perineum, off to the side a bit, and surprisingly not along my scar tissue. I had no idea about that one; I was surprised when she told me about it. All were completely healed by my six week appt, which is months faster than my fourth degree tear. \n\nI would 100% do an unmedicated birth again after experiencing both a home and hospital birth. Even though I had more people at my home birth (2 midwives, a student midwife, 2 paramedics, and my husband makes 6 people in my small bedroom, plus me of course) it still felt more intimate and special. \n\nIf you read all that, thanks! You deserve a medal! Lol. If not...\n\nTldr; Home birth. 3 hour labour. Midwife almost didn't get here in time; called 911. No labour pains until transition phase, then lots of pain until pushing phase, then the ring of fire. Pushed for 45 minutes with my ass in the air for most of it with 6 people watching. Three tears; 2 first degree, 1 second degree. Big baby boy!! Happy mama. :)",

    "body": "Hey guys! I graduated yesterday so I wanted to share my birth center story\n\nSo I had taken a lot of your advice of “lots of sex!” To help induce labor and finally on Sunday I started feeling the beginning of contractions! They kinda stayed 15/2 min apart and where easy enough to handle that I slept through Sunday night and then woke up Monday with moderate cramping and by 2pm my sister convinced me to give my midwife a call and give her a heads up cause my contractions where 5/6 min apart. And she agreed that it sounded like early labor and said she would check in later. \n\nAnd as time went on and after phone check ins I was still just convinced it was probably false labor but at 10pm my older sister convinced me to just go into the birth center to get checked and turns out I was 4cm dilated and in early labor!\n\nI had 2 Midwife’s with me at the birth center and they just where such an amazing team they explained the timeline of just how they where gonna check on me and we got settled in. What I loved most about the birth center was that the rooms are super spacious and generally you have the entire building to yourself and can labor and walk around and not have to worry and you can also give birth in the tub which was what I had been hoping. Also you can eat and for me it was so nice to be able to eat whatever food I wanted to keep my strength up.\n\nSince I was still in early labor the Midwife’s gave me gentle goals of just rest/movement And then gave DH and I some space since it was 11pm. From about 12pm through 6 am we worked through early and active labor and they checked me and I was a 6! I feel really fortunate that I had no issues and that my body followed a pretty natural labor storyline. At that point they had me wake up my body more and do 30min activity 30min rest and by around 9:30 they asked if I wanted my water broke and so they broke it and started having me try contractions in different positions to get baby to lower. \n\nI loved that I had so many different options to labor on they had a yoga ball,suspended swing, birth stool, shower, bath tub, but my least favorite was the toilet! Ladies let me tell you it was the most effective for bringing baby down but it brought on the most intense contractions ever!!! By around 10:30 i had labored on the birth stool in the shower for a bit after they had popped my water and asked to get in the tub. And they said if I felt like trying to bear down I could. Cue to the next 2ish hours of trying pushing different positions in the tub and the birth stool they where having difficulties because I guess my perenium is longer and his poor little head was having a hard time fitting out so I was having a hard time and just wanted to give up and take a break 😂 \n\nI gave up on the tub because it just wasn’t being as effective as we had hoped and switched positions about every 15 or so minutes and I found that laying on my side in bed while holding my leg up in the air was what really helped me push. After what seemed like an eternity of still struggling with his head they told me that the next couple of contractions they where gonna get him out cause his heart rate was lowering and they got a bunch of olive oil and basically slathered it all over and got their hands in their and on the next push with their help out came his head! Little man was born at 12:21 and we where in awe of him. Delivered the placenta with a couple of pushes and you guys where right it’s kinda like delivering a jellyfish!\n\nMy Midwife’s where such a great support and even when I basically lost all dignity they did such a good job of tracking my progress,making sure they balanced giving me space and coaching me and just being a positive source of encouragement when contractions got really strong and I just wanted to give up. \n\nMy husband was my other support system and he was such an amazing rock and supporter and just was so in tune with me and what I needed not only encouragement wise but also physically with holding my body up and just being an incredible teammate and I couldn’t have gotten through labor without him.\n\nCue to our little guy after doing skin for about and hourish they started doing his newborn exam and just found his hands and feet and breathing was a little off. They wanted to give him time to transition so they asked if we would stay longer to which we agreed.after an hour of kinda trying to work out what was going on with his lungs and cue me being an emotional wreck hey said we needed to transfer to the hospital because his breathing wasn’t getting better and it was all such a blur but cue me new mother in a panic because we basically had to leave the birth center 2 hours after I gave birth and there was no way I was leaving my little boy.\n\nCue to now we are doing what our local hospital calls “camping” because we are not admitted but they still wanted to give me a room since I had just given birth. So basically what happened was that he had a bunch of fluid in his lungs and they where really wet and most babies have what you call “transitioning” from breathing from the womb to breathing oxygen and he was just having a harder time making that transition. Hopefully he gets to come home in 2 days!\n\nI am so grateful that it’s not anything more serious but I am beyond exhausted and I’m so grateful my sister and my birth photographer both stepped in and helped my husband and I because we where both exhausted from going through labor and then all the sudden having to go to the hospital so suddenly is not what you expect to have happen. Our birth center was also 5min from the hospital and I’m so glad that my husband did not let me have a Home birth instead because we live 30min from the hospital and that time is so crucial. I highly suggest using a birth center for all the options it gives you and freedom when your in labor and I think it’s a really great way to compromise to a safe alternative to a hospital without putting too much risk on baby. \n\nI’ve really loved being apart of this sub and I can’t believe I’ve done it! I have so much more respect and admiration for woman as a whole after going through labor myself! Also I didn’t tear! And I would definitely say that taking the evening primrose oil in the weeks in advance really helped that! \n\nTd;Lr delivered naturaly at birth center then had to transfer baby boy to hospital for fluid in lungs but everyone is safe and recovering!

I noticed a big difference with the first period I got, and now I've had 4 and they were all a fucking cakewalk compared to before. I used to get horribly depressed, empty, tired, angry, and have vivid nightmares about suicide for 8+ days of the month. Now I barely even notice my period is coming except for the occasional tiny cramp that makes me think, \"oh yeah, I'm on day 27, huh.\" \n\nBefore this, I tried: vitex or chasteberry, evening primrose oil, black cohosh, calcium supplements, St. John's Wort (antidepressant), Lamictal (mood stabilizer), and probably other stuff I don't even remember anymore.\n\nEveryone is different, but if nothing else is working for you, Mirtazapine might be worth asking about! A HUGE weight is finally off my shoulders and I'm not losing a fourth of my life to uncontrollable darkness and pain anymore.",

    "body": "I started drinking the raspberry leaf tea around 30 weeks, and started out slow (first two weeks I drank one cup, next two weeks I drank two cups, ect). I am a firm believer in this tea, it started up BH contractions for me right after I finished a cup (unsolicited advice- don't drink all your tea before going to bed).\n\nI also started eating dates around 34 weeks. So for week 34 I ate 3 dates a day, then from week 35 and onward I would eat six a day. I hated them, but they gave me more BH contractions.\n\nAt 37 weeks I started evening primrose oil. I took 1000mgs orally, and inserted 1000mgs into my hoo-haa. \n\nAt my 39 week appointment I was just about 3 cm, doctor said I was effaced (but not how much), and totally sad that I hadn't gone into labor yet. I had planned a repeat c-section for Sunday (when I would be 40 weeks and one day). \n\nI woke up, 39 weeks and 5 days, a little early and not feeling right. By 6 am I started to have a hunch I was feeling contractions. From 7 am to 8 am I was positive I was feeling contractions, and I estimated them to be 8-10 mins apart. I didn't want to jinx anything though so I kept about my day and let my husband know something was up. \n\nFrom 8 am to 9 am I started timing them. They started out 5 mins apart and quickly went down to 3 mins apart. The more I walked around the faster they would hit me. \n\nIt was at 9 am to 10 am that I started to get panicky. I really wanted to go take a bath, but I was afraid I was wasting time and if we didn't go to the hospital soon then this would be home birth territory. \n\nThank goodness the inlaws arrived to watch my 21 month old and off we went. In the car the contractions went from every 2 mins to every 5 mins, and when we got inside the hospital they amped back up to every 2 mins. \n\nNurses took me to triage to verify I was actually in labor, and the husband was totally expecting to be sent home. I was managing the contractions very well, talking in between, laughing. Natural contractions are pretty easy actually. The nurse checks me and I'm at 5 cm! Woo! We're having a baby! \n\nGet into a labor room and suddenly contractions are coming every minute. They hurt, but it's ok in between them. Nurse checks me again 8 cm. I curl over the bed getting the husband to push on my back for the contractions. Now they hurt, and I started to cry in between them. \n\nI crawl into the bed on my side around a pillow and feel this intense pressure. Nurse says it's ok to bear down if I want to. Which is good because I was going to do it anyways. So next contraction I bear down and bam, water breaks. I don't know why but it felt like the best pee ever. \n\nNext came pushing. And this is where I was terrified. This was where I failed the first time (pushed for 3 hours and couldn't get the baby out). I kept asking for pain killers (too late now), and if she was really coming out, and just doubting the whole process. The nurse was great though. She pushed down on my perineum and that really helped the baby make \"the turn.\"\n\nI was exhausted, sweating bullets, and barely able to keep my eyes open. But each contraction I curled up, held out my legs, and pushed with all my might. I pushed from 12:30 pm to 2:55 pm and it felt like an eternity. It was a surreal moment to see her head appear between my legs, and suddenly I was getting yelled at to push \"now now now\" to get her shoulders out. That is when I tore, second degree complex tear. \n\nAfter she came out, all the exhaustion in my muscles just disappeared. All I wanted to do was curl up with my baby and have everyone to stop picking at me. But the doctor helped out my placenta, and spent the next 30 minutes sewing my back up. Baby girl was 9 lbs 3 oz, 21 in. \n\nI'm still in shock. I did a VBAC. Natural. WTF was I thinking? [I remember now.] (http://imgur.com/qKGwJlF) Labor is hard, c-sections are hard, we are warrior women. \n\nAs an extra, I was starting to get anemic around week 26. And I pretty much stayed on an extra iron supplement till the end of the pregnancy and I think it really helped ( having more energy during the pregnancy, and possibly at the end with all the blood loss).

(The initial thought was a reproductive endocrinologist, but a different medical focus would also work, as long as you work with couples trying to get pregnant.) Our initial list of questions looks like this:\n  \n* What is the most common error or bad advice you find couples following? \n* How helpful is charting in the long run? Or are we just driving ourselves bonkers for no reason?\n* What's the biggest myth about conceiving that you would like to dispel?\n* What are some extra \"tricks\" that we should always practice when trying to conceive?\n* What is the most common cause for infertility? \n* What is your worst-case scenario story? \n* What is your best case scenario story? \n* What made you decided to study gynecology/the field?\n* I hear a lot about herbal supplements like Vitex, royal jelly, and evening primrose oil. Do these have an actual effect on fertility?\n* The first advice anyone trying to conceive gets is \"relax, try not to stress\". What is the point where stress crosses from 'normal' levels to 'burning your ovaries up' levels?\n* Soy isoflavones... how likely are they to help and/or hurt?\n* Should women change their schedule (as far as for taking fertility medication) in regards to their shortened/extended cycles?\n* Explain Secondary Infertility. We had no problem conceiving out daughter but have had no luck trying for number 2. We have been trying off and on for nearly 3 years with no results. \n* What is your opinion of the effectiveness of Eastern medicine in treating infertility? Acupuncture, herbs, etc? Why aren't there more studies examining these treatments, so that we can have some definitive answers on whether/how well they work?\n* Why do so many OB/GYNs still go with the assumption that women have 28 day cycles? Why do they doubt that we know the day we ovulate/conceive? Why do they still use the wheel, even when we are certain of the date of conception?\n* Why is there such a wide range of opinions on the effectiveness of progesterone supplementation in the luteal phase?\n* Where and how do you draw the ethics line when it comes to how many embryos to transfer during an IVF procedure? What are the factors you consider?\n* How many couples have you met who have conceived twins or more on clomid? Does the dose make much of a difference?\n* How old is too old to start infertility treatment?\n  \nThanks!",

    "body": "Love reading birth stories and am excited to share the birth of my second (surprise-sex, we were team green) son!\n\nI had really annoying prodromal labor starting at 36 weeks this time around that involved real contractions and dilation, which led to several frustratingly futile hospital visits to be basically told to go home due to no real progress of labor. My first child was born after my waters broke spontaneously at 37+6, so once I hit 37+6 and I was still dealing with prodromal labor, I was getting pretty annoyed, and it was a total mind game. At one point my father in law came out from Prague because it seemed like labor was imminent, but it was yet another false alarm. In the meantime, I continued doing all my OCD labor prep stuff, the full monty- red raspberry leaf tea, acupuncture, hayflower steam baths (it’s a German thing), evening primrose oil, bouncing on the exercise ball, so that at least I’d feel like I was doing something. The nice thing about having my 2 year old son, though, is he kept me distracted and we had a lot of nice bonding snuggly time together. \n\nFinally, on the evening of April 30 at 39+4 I started getting contractions that were more and more frequent and uncomfortable and I had the sneaking suspicion that this could be the real deal. My husband was at a meeting and I called him around 9 pm to tell him I would love his support as the contractions were arriving about every 7 minutes even after I took a hot shower and tried to lie down. We don’t have any immediate family in town, so we made a few phone calls and my friend’s husband generously said he would come over and spend the night with my son- he’s a rockstar! My husband called a taxi, we grabbed the bag and headed out around 11:30. Throughout the contractions, I focused on my breathing and some hypnobirthing exercises, and did things like say the alphabet slowly or cheesy mantras like “these are all waves, you’ll meet your baby soon.” This really helped keep me grounded and calm and I would also squeeze my husband’s hand during a contraction. \n\nWe arrived at our hospital at midnight. They wanted to do a quick CTG and of course it registered tons of frequent contractions right away but it was really uncomfortable for me to be sitting there; I wanted to get up and move. The midwife came in (birth is primarily midwife-led in Germany) to check on things and asked if she could perform a cervical check. I made some grim joke about how I probably haven’t dilated further than 2 centimeters anyways. She took a little glance and poof- I was already at 7 centimeters! I was a little blown away, as I had had a check just that morning and had been at a 2.\n\nShe asked me how I’d like to proceed. I asked if I could get in the birthing tub as I had really hoped to do a waterbirth if at all possible, and at that very moment the thought seemed particularly appealing. I felt like the contractions were manageable and that being in the warm water sounded like the perfect thing at that moment. She said that sounded like an excellent plan and went to go fill the tub while a needle was placed in my arm and I was given an injection of plain water, apparently as a sort of natural pain relief. Then I climbed into the lovely warm tub and it felt AMAZING. She dimmed the lights, put an underwater CTG button around my belly and told us to call her whenever we needed anything, support, or if I felt I needed to push. \n\nLaboring in the water was really brilliant. I was able to move around as needed or just lie and float between contractions. It took the edge off and I felt as relaxed as humanly possible while in labor. I liked being mobile (that was one of the things I didn’t love about my epidural with my first birth) and it was a very soothing environment. I also liked that I wasn’t really hooked up to anything, other than the waistband CTG, which didn’t really bother or inhibit me. The midwife came in every so often to see how things were doing. At 1:30 a.m. she checked me and I was at nearly 9 cm which made me feel nervous but excited. Close to 2 a.m. I felt like I was getting the urge to push so we called her in. She said the head was there and I could push.\n\nI admit that I did get kind of scared regarding the pushing- I started getting some irrational fears that the head would get stuck, and I’ll be honest, pushing is not the most pleasant sensation for me personally. A lot of women say they enjoy it because it feels like a big relief but I actually felt like the contractions were way easier to deal with. But push one must, so with the support and help of the midwife and my husband, 13 minutes later...it was a BOY! It was so amazing to find out the sex right at the birth have the baby float through the water into my arms. And I was blown away at how fast it all went- we got there at midnight and were holding a baby two hours later. I cried for joy.\n\nI then had to get out for the placenta to be birthed, because they don’t let you deliver the placenta in the tub, which I guess makes sense. They gave me a slight dose of oxytocin and the midwife gently pushed on my belly and it came out. I was a little scared because with my son, I had retained placenta and that was kind of traumatic, but this time all was well and it came out without a hitch and no hemorrhaging. The midwife and doctor took a look at the “damage” and I basically barely tore, though I had some tiny cut, and the doctor really kept insisting on a stitch or two whilst the midwife felt like it would heal just fine by itself. I felt really pressured to get the stitch so the one negative point of the experience was really that as the doctor was kind of a jerk- it genuinely was hurting and I could feel the needle pricking and kept yelling that it hurt and he was basically trying to convince me that it was fine. But whatever, it was over and done with pretty quickly while my husband was with the baby getting measured.\n\nOur little Abram was 7 lb 3 oz and 20 inches, born on May 1 and nursed right away. I’m a day and a half out now and the recovery so far has been EONS better than the first time around. No problems using the toilet, walking around, groggy/tired but feeling far more like myself. The physiotherapist came around today to check my pelvic floor and abdominal muscles (yay Germany for being so on top of that) and said everything was healing wonderfully.\n\nI wish you all wonderful, healthy births and babies!",

I knew it would be tough, but for me, it has been so challenging that I sometimes struggle to convince myself to keep going.\n\nInterestingly, I helped my brother start carnivore, and he’s thriving much faster than I am—which I’m happy about, but it also makes me wonder why my own adaptation has been so rough.\n\nPrimary Issues: BAM, Oxalate Dumping & Unresolved High Heart Rate\n\nI’m 1.5 months in, and my biggest struggles are:\n✅ Bile Acid Malabsorption (BAM) Type 2 (officially diagnosed, still have my gallbladder).\n✅ Oxalate Dumping, which I strongly suspect due to my symptoms.\n✅ High Heart Rate that doesn’t resolve with electrolytes, more water, or increased calories. This is one of the main reasons I suspect oxalate dumping.\n\nI’ve spent over $10K on medical testing, so I have a fairly detailed picture of my body’s chemistry. One major finding is that my GLA (Gamma-Linolenic Acid) levels are at zero, which may be a root cause of my BAM. Since adding GLA (via evening primrose oil/black currant oil), my digestion has improved, and I’m having fewer loose stools—though I still have some instability.\n\nNext Steps to Stabilize My Body\n\n1️⃣ TUDCA & Taurine – To improve bile flow and gallbladder function.\n2️⃣ Carefully Adding Low-Oxalate Foods – To slow down oxalate dumping so I can stay on this diet without overwhelming symptoms.\n\nLooking for Advice from Others Who’ve Successfully Managed Oxalate Dumping\n\nIf you’ve made it through a rough oxalate dumping phase, I’d love to hear what worked for you.\n\t•\tDid you reintroduce oxalates temporarily, and if so, how did you do it?\n\t•\tHow did you handle high heart rate if you experienced it?\n\nAny insights would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.",

Hopefully some of this will help!\n\nYou might try collagen-rich stews or braises. Collagen causes the production of small amounts of oxalate in the body, and it doesn’t cause the side effects that can follow some plant or processed foods. \n\nOxtail, beef cheeks, brisket, shank and chuck are good beef sources, and pork spare ribs. If you can handle chicken feet they add a ton of richness. They’re great comfort foods when you’re feeling sick.\n\nYou might also try skin-on salmon- I fry it skin-down in butter on medium until it releases from the pan, the skin is crispy, delicious and sweet. I don’t know much about GLA, but if you’re taking a lot of omega 6 to help with your digestion then it may help your symptoms to also consume higher omega 3.\n\nHope you start feeling better soon!

Probably at least worth a try, without too much risk (not medical advise… just a friendly suggestion).\n\nEDIT: To summarize a few of the main points of his book, the author explains that in his opinion— gallstones affect something like 95% of people (at some point in their lives) and cause around 60% of all diseases. The stones are usually located primarily in the liver (surprisingly enough), but also sometimes gallbladder. These stones are caused by unhealthy eating of processed foods and other bad habits. The stones can clog or obstruct bile ducts which causes a whole slew of gastrointestinal and digestive issues, along with a ton of other symptoms and issues as a result. He details an inexpensive, fairly easy, and effective process of cleansing your liver and gallbladder— using just a few ingredients you can buy at your local grocery store.

    "body": "hi guys! \n\nI've been a lurker for the most part but I tried something that changed my face **amazingly** and I wanted to share it with you, and hopefully get more stories on it!\n\n**First off, my skin type:** I'm 20 years old, with combination oily-normal skin, acne prone ever since I was like 12 years old. I live in a tropical place with high humidity and 30 deg temperature, which compounds to my acne prone skin. I usually get hormonal acne, with pretty bad breakouts twice a month.\n\nI wanted to try the OCM thing that this sub has been raving about for the longest time, but oils are pretty expensive over here...so I decided to pick any random oil, which happened to be Evening Primrose Oil (EPO). My house has tons of it because my mom takes them religiously (she has amazing skin btw, she's 51 and I swear it looks like a 30 year old's. Nobody ever even comes close to guessing her age right)\n\nI've been applying it on my face, and oh my god...the difference. It's extremely glowy, and my breakouts are far less and less severe. I'm so so so so happy!!!! I didn't include pictures because I don't have \"before\" pictures with no concealer/foundation on because I hated my skin so much. \n\n**Current skin routine:**\n1. Remove makeup with coconut oil + Pond's Cold Cream\n2. Wash face with Neutrogena Cleanser\n3. Apply Queen Helene's Mint Julep Mask\n4. Apply EPO topically.\n\nSorry if this post is too long, I'm just really excited! *Everybody* has been telling me that my skin has never looked better and I totally feel the difference! Has anyone else tried EPO topically? Did it work for you?",

That said, those ratings are not infallibly contingent to real-life usage or interaction with our skin. \n\nHow is it for you in terms of comedogenicity?

I had some spotting early Monday morning and throughout the day along with some cramps that became somewhat timeable. I had some tacos with hot sauce for lunch, tamales for dinner, and about 1000 mg of evening primrose oil taken orally. \n\nBy the end of the day, I was feeling ready to try and go to the hospital and wait for a room in triage. So, that's what I did. \n\nThey got me in at 11:30pm and I was dilated to a 4/80% effaced. This is when they gave me the IV -and holy shit the doctor kept fucking up my IV and had to do it 3 times :(. That was horrid and my SO was pissed about it. The nurse ended up having to place my IV. But my other hand is still healing from the punctures. \n\nI was in triage for about 3 hours. My cramps were getting worse. It was about this time that I had my \"bloody show\". I had been losing mucus since around 30 weeks, but this was the real deal. \n\nWe were taken to labor and delivery around 2:30am. By 3 my waters broke. It felt like a huge POP in my pelvis. I could feel myself leaking continuously. This is when the contractions got too painful for me. I'm talking \"hold onto the bed rails for dear life\"kind of painful. I had no idea my body could dish out that much pain. I immediately asked for an epidural. I don't know how anyone gives birth without one. \n\nSo I get the epidural (which was a godsend) and 15 or 20 minutes later I feel great! I mean, yeah it's weird that my legs feel like a hot sack of meat - but that's WAY better than the alternative. \n\nSo she checks me after that and I'm at 6cm dilated. I get a little rest and wake up at 7am. This time she checks me and I'm 9 and a half centimeters. The baby is at 0 station. I start pushing around 9 (which was REALLY difficult to do but completely painless). I had him around 10. \n\nSkin to skin immediately with 30 second delayed cord clamping. 7lbs 2oz and 21 inches long. He's perfect.\n\nHe came out grunting a little bit, and they wanted to be extra cautious so they took him to NICU to be monitored on his oxygen levels. I'm told he's doing better on his own and they want to keep him down there for a few more hours just to be certain.\n\nIAMSOTIRED!!! Like it feels like I just got ran over by a bulldozer. I didn't realize how tired I would be. \n\nI'll post a picture sometime later when he's out of the NICU and I can get a proper photo.\n",

    "body": "He’s here! Little one was born 14 hours after arrival at the hospital. We are home now so I am getting a chance to tell the story, which I feel compelled to do (1) to help document my own memory, (2) because I personally benefited so much from the communal wisdom everyone on these forums has shared. Our collective knowledge is priceless. Now, it’s my turn!\n\n36 weeks: I started trying all of the natural ways to prepare for labor, including drinking red raspberry leaf tea, eating dates, bouncing on a yoga ball, going on walks, evening primrose oil (orally), etc. It’s not that I necessarily believed any of these measures would help, but that I knew they wouldn’t hurt, had time on my hands, and wanted to feel like I had at least some control over the process. \n\n38 weeks: Had my first cervical check, 1 cm dilated. (I had declined the check when offered at 36 and 37 weeks.)\n\n39: Another check, still 1 cm. Scheduled an induction for the following week, but continued to try really hard to not need the appointment. \n\n39+4: Lost my mucus plug. Initially saw some jelly-like discharge in the morning, a few hours later the entire plug fell out into the toilet in one, blood-tinged piece. Started to feel menstrual cramps every evening, but they went away during the day. \n\n40+3\n\n9pm: Arrived at hospital for scheduled induction. Soon discovered I was already having small contractions but not feeling them. Still at 1 cm.\n\n10:30pm: Was offered Cytotec and a Foley bulb together to get the contractions going. Declined the Foley due to anxiety about the insertion process, and wanted to see how the Cytotec alone would progress me.\n\n40+4\n\n12:30-1:30am: Cytotec was a little too effective, I started having back-to-back contractions with almost no break in between. The lack of breaks was affecting baby’s heart rate.\n\n1:45am: Was given a small dose of terbutaline to slow down the contractions and steady baby’s heart rate. This felt discouraging and I knew I’d have to get over my anxiety and accept the Foley bulb to keep things progressing, because obviously the Cytotec was not working well for me and baby. \n\n3:00am: Only at 1.5 cm. Accepted the Foley insertion. Honestly, it went in fine and although a bit uncomfortable at first, was not as bad as I’d expected. \n\n3:30am: The Foley really ramped things up, and quickly. I requested an epidural and thought maybe I was weak, because so many women on these forums seem to make it to 4cm before doing so but I needed the relief. \n\n4:00am: Got the epidural. The first shot felt like a quick sting, and the insertion was fine. However, even though I would have preferred to have an anesthesiologist administer the epidural, in the chaos of the moment I ended up accepting it from a nurse anesthetist. I later come to question this decision and wished I’d followed my instinct on requesting a doctor (which the hospital would have provided). Apparently, 5 women on the floor had all requested epidurals around the same time.\n\nThe relief however, was amazing and I finally got to sleep the next few hours. Also, the anesthetist was surprised I’d done the Foley insertion without an epidural—would have been good to know that was an option the whole time! \n\n7:30am: Woke up to order breakfast (clear liquids menu--got chicken bone broth and apple juice) and felt the balloon pop out! \n\n8:30am: My OB that I’d seen throughout my pregnancy arrived to check on me, it was great to see a familiar face at the hospital (a benefit to pre-scheduling the date). We were both SHOCKED to find out I was at 8 cm and most of my water had broken!! She broke the rest and told me to expect my baby in the next few hours. \n\nThe epidural had other plans…\n\n10am - 12pm: This two hour span is a painful blur. The epidural wore off, and I was at 10 cm dilated and feeling excruciating pain after having spent the prior hours in a comfortable state of labor. The nurses were trying to get me to do a practice push but all I could focus on was the pain. I was unable to follow any instructions or do anything other than beg for relief. I don’t really have the words for how bad it was. I was begging for a C section, screaming that I can’t do this, asking everyone to please make the pain stop. \n\nThe anesthesia team gave me a few top offs, maybe 4-5 different meds or doses over this two hour span, but nothing helped. After two hours of agony, they eventually decided to replace the epidural, which they’d been trying to avoid since I was at 10 cm and everyone wanted me to be able to feel some contractions so I’d be able to effectively push. The new epidural provided almost instant, sweet relief. I was once again a calm, normal person, ready to deliver my baby. \n\nNoon: I spent the next hour pushing, and was apparently pretty effective at it despite the fresh epidural! I had asked for a mirror and it was the coolest (and most encouraging) thing ever to see baby’s little head poking out on pushes as he made his way down the birth canal! I still picture that moment sometimes when I’m staring at his beautiful head of hair. Pushing (after pain relief!) was definitely one of the highlights of the experience. \n\nHe was born within an hour with an angelic cry, and I got immediate skin-to-skin contact while my husband cut the cord. With baby in my arms, I didn’t feel or care about whatever was going on down there - apparently I had a minor tear and received a stitch, the placenta came out, etc. \n\nThe next two nights in the hospital were a blur, with very little sleep as every two hours a nurse or other professional needed to do something or another to me or baby. Also, something I hadn’t considered or read about on these forums… my bladder didn’t “wake up” after the epidurals. I didn’t pee for 8 hours after the urinary catheter was removed, which slightly dampened the post-partum experience. I had to have another catheter placed for my first night with baby at the hospital, and it was an uncomfortable (but fairly quick) process. It was removed after 12 hours and my bladder has since slowly regained function. :) \n\nBaby and I are doing great and finally home. It was all worth it and I love my sweet baby boy so much. \n\nI could write another post or two about various aspects to all this (good vs bad nurses, more thoughts on how I feel about the anesthesia team’s delayed reaction to my pain, etc) but that’s enough for now! Good luck to the future mamas. The other side is awesome.",

This person posted about how EPO has anecdotally been shown to help with hormonal acne, so I decided to try it out.  \n\nI'm new(er) to the Beginners Skin Care Routine, so for the last few weeks I had been washing with CeraVe foaming wash, following with Neutrogena Stress Control Acne Astringent, and moisturizing with CeraVe lotion.  The results and been okay, but my jaw-line acne remained completely unaffected.  I was sticking to the recommended routine and figured it would take a month or more to see results.\n\nAfter the post mentioning EPO, I picked up a bottle and swapped it out for the CeraVe moisturizing lotion (I decided not to use the oil for cleansing, but for moisturizing instead) and the results have been IMMEDIATE.  Five days in, my jaw-line acne is GONE, with only some barely-there bumps that are quickly receding and some scarring (well, more discoloring) from some stubborn and persistent acne two months ago, that will hopefully fade.\n\nIf anybody is struggling with hormonal acne, I suggest giving the evening primrose oil a try (it was $13 at my local health food store), and maybe it will be your saving grace too!",

    "body": "Update November 2021 (14 months after I started the pill) it’s stopping or greatly reducing my periods, this was the reason I got on it initially. Unless something big happens this will probably be my last update.\n\n………………………………………\n\nPositive so far. 10 days in.\n\nAfter reading posts on here there were 4 things worrying me about starting Cerazette (or any hormonal BC). They were negative mental health effects, irregular bleeding, drying up and reduced sex drive.\n\nI’ve not been on hormonal BC before.\n\nI’m only 10 days in, I started around half way through my cycle, I’m not sure if I ovulated in the days before taking the first pill.\n\nSo far, my mental health is as good as it’s been for the last year. \n\nNo irregular bleeding, my period is due in the next few days. My natural cycle is not very consistent, varies between 24 and 35 days, sometimes longer. It will be interesting to see if it comes.\n\nOver the first few days I was concerned that I was too dry down there, turned out I had bacterial vaginosis (what bad timing!), got antibiotics, on day 4 I started getting properly wet again.\n\nAs for sex drive, no change there.\n\nUPDATE (30 Sep). Got incredible pre-period-pain not long after making the post. I thought my period was coming (it is due) but I’m not sure if it’s going to. The pain only lasted 18 hours, usually the pain continues until my period starts. Still waiting to see if my period will come. I feel tired, like I usually do on my period, cervix is low, but not as low as it usually is on my period.\n\nUPDATE (3 Oct). Amazingly light period, just a few clots and spotting. No pain and I’m not as tired as I was a few days ago. I did not expect a difference in my period so soon after starting Cerazette.\n\nUPDATE (9 Oct). Period ended up being 9 days from initial pain to the last of the flow (I’m pretty sure this is actually about how long they normally are). It was incredibly light compared to normal. I’m hoping that my periods get lighter and shorter. Will keep updating.\n\nUPDATE: (2 Nov). I had a super light, pain and tiredness free 8 day period. I didn’t know they could be so nice. First 2 days no liner needed, second 2 days needed a liner, then 2 days needing a pad (just a little too much for a panty liner), then last 2 days just a liner again.\n\nI’m a bit drier than I would like, but my special friend has dumped me so some of my dryness could be because I’m just not feeling too great at the moment.\n\nI’ve noticed I’m eating more again, but I’m not sure if that’s the pill or comfort eating, but I haven’t put on any weight (I feel like I’ve put on a little, but the scales tell me I haven’t). I’ve been good and chosen healthier snacks rather than the junk I used to snack on.\n\nUPDATE (2 Dec) had a period a couple of weeks ago (a week early) it was heavier than the other 2 I’ve had since being on Cerazette, about the same as the lighter periods I sometimes had without BC. Last night I noticed spotting/clots. Today I had some short sharp pains in my lower abdomen similar to ovulation pain (not where I get ovulation pain though). I’m assuming this irregular bleeding is my body adapting to the Cerazette.\n\nUPDATE (16 Dec) have had spotting for the last couple of weeks. Some days nothing, some days need a liner or pad. No discomfort or pain though.\n\nOverall I’m still happy with Cerazette. \n\nI’ve now been on it almost 11 weeks.\n\nUPDATE (15 Jan) I don’t think I’ve had any issues in the last month. I’ve been a bit down, but I’m 95% sure that’s relationship stuff, not BC. I actually think the tiny dose of progesterone everyday has prevented some really bad emotional crashes (I’ve had some really bad days). \n\nLost 2 more kg, now 97-98kg. I was 100 kg when I started Cerazette. Over the 12-18 months before starting BC I lost 25kg.\n\n3 days ago I got some super light spotting, today it’s a bit heavier. UPDATE this bleed stopped today (20 Jan). It was another 8/9 day bleed just like my pre-BC periods. These BC bleeds are much lighter and easier to deal with.\n\nUPDATE (14 Feb) after reading that drinking alcohol can increase estrogen levels I thought I would experiment, I went two weeks without drinking. On Tuesday evening I had two standard drinks (the amount I have when I drink). On Thursday I started spotting. I have had no other alcohol this week and my spotting stopped yesterday. I will hold off drinking for a couple more weeks then try this again. I was getting frustrated with frequent spotting, but if it’s being triggered by drinking then I may need find an alternative (unfortunately weed isn’t legal here yet and my job requires relatively frequent drug tests, so that’s not an option)\n\nUPDATE (12 Mar) No news really. \n\nI’ve been drinking quite a bit but I’m not getting spotting so I’m not sure what was going on with my spotting. I’ve had no spotting since my last update.\n\nMy mental state is ok, it’s not 100% but I’m pretty sure it’s not related to the pill.\n\nUPDATE (26 Mar)\n\nI’ve had some period like symptoms over the last week or so. Bloating, persistent back pain and after a few days I started bleeding. I’ve now been bleeding for 4 days. It’s light, only needing 2 liners over a day. It’s old, dry and clotty. This was very similar pain-wise to pre BC periods, it was light though. Lasted a bit more than a week from start of pain to end of bleed.\n\nUPDATE (24 Apr)\n\nSuper light spotting started on the 22nd. \n\nI’ve had no spotting or issues over the last 4 weeks. I’ve drunk a lot of alcohol and that hasn’t affected my bleeding/spotting. \n\nI’ve been quite emotional over the last couple of weeks, but I’ve had stressors that I believe have triggered the emotional roller coaster.\n\nUPDATE (2 May) spotting stopped today. Had a couple of days of heavy spotting.\n\nUPDATE (29 May) no issues in the last month.\n\nDecided to try Evening Primrose Oil to see if it would reduce my monthly bleeding. It seems like it has, I started bleeding on the 24th and also started taking EPO that day, I only bled for 4 days. It was very light flow, just a couple of thick liners/thin pads each day.\n\nUPDATE (4 Sept) No real news. Had monthly bleeds that have been very light, just a few panty liners needed. \n\nThis month’s (August) bleed hasn’t arrived yet, hopefully this means they have finally stopped.\n\nI wish I was using these pills to protect me from pregnancy not just to reduce my periods. (EDIT, I can’t believe I have to clarify this. I’m not in a relationship therefore I’m not using it for its intended purpose (pregnancy), I’m using it for its secondary purpose (period management))\n\nUPDATE (4 Nov) nothing remarkable, a few days of spotting in late September, I don’t think I got a bleed in October. \n\nIt’s taken a year but Cerazette seems be be doing it’s job, stopping or greatly reducing my periods.",

    "body": "Edited to add: info about the Bishop Score & exact birth time.\n\nI really need to share our birth story as, although it was a positive experience overall, there was a lot of things that were learned along the way that I'm just having trouble integrating. I would really love to hear others' experience and just your overall support would be so so so helpful. TIA.\n\n**Biggest fear:** *My biggest fear going into the induction was that my body wasn't ready, and that – after spending a bunch of time in labor – I'll develop some sort of complication and will necessitate a c-section. (This has happened to a few of my friends in recent months.)*\n\n*I follow MFM Dr Shannon Clark on IG (babiesafter35 / tiktokbabydoc on IG & TikTok, respectively). She did a video recently on the Bishop Score and its impact on success of an induction. So at my membrane sweep / last OB appointment, I asked my doctor to tell me what my Bishop Score was (it was 5 both on March 29 / and at admission for induction). I also asked for it after the Cervadil treatment.*\n\n*Also, my stance on getting an epidural was: I will ask for it if I feel like I need it, but I don't want to ask for it too early, have labor \"fail to progress\" which could lead to my biggest fear becoming a reality.*\n\n**Some background:** I am 39.5 yo, and although my OB was willing to let me go to 41+6 before inducing, I, myself asked for a 40w induction because I wasn't comfortable with my advanced age and everything I heard with respect to placental senescence at this age. Plus, I had gained 65lbs during the pregnancy, had developed costochondritis after a Covid infection in early 3rd tri, so I was MASSIVELY uncomfortable during the final 5-6 weeks.\n\n**Leading up to induction:** I was doing A LOT to get my body ready (acupuncture, massage, all kinds of tonics, evening primrose oil, etc.). I was also experiencing prodromal labor for about 5 weeks, so uterine contractions that would get regular... than disappear for days. I started doing cervical checks at 37+2 and asked for a membrane sweep at 39+2. The cervical checks + membrane sweep helped get my mucus plug get expelled in small chunks over a period of several weeks, but I didn't have \"one big blob\" ... bloody or otherwise... that I've heard / read so much about. However, the weekend before the induction, I started having more regular contractions. On Apr 1, they were regular and 20ish min apart. They kinda stopped overnight. On Sunday morning (Apr 2), they started off being 7-8 min apart, then 5-6 min apart. They weren't \"painful\"... I later described them to my doula as someone giving me a \"really tight hug\" around my lower abdomen. Later that day/night, they were coming every 2-4 min, but stopped for many hours overnight, and then started again in the middle of the night, then stopped. It was a total mindf\\*ck, tbh. I called the hospital to get their input and they said \"yeah, sounds like early labor... you can come get checked out but we'll likely send you home if there hasn't been any progress.\" Considering that I made the call at 4:30am, going to the hospital and getting sent home sounded very unappealing, so I didn't. The contractions stopped by the morning, and didn't start up again until 5:30pm, just 2 hours before my induction.\n\n**Induction:**\n\n**Monday, Apr 3**: we checked into the hospital on Monday, April 3, at 7:30pm (my due date).  It took about 1hr to get us settled and all medical information verified / checked, and monitors placed. It took another hour to get a saline lock into a vein since – even though I've always prided on having great veins for blood draws – my IV veins are scraggly AF and the first 2 placements were into a bifurcated vein, and had to be redone. Then, around 9:30pm, I was checked for dilation (1-2cm, 50% effaced, soft cervix, but anterior and station of -3) and given Cervadil overnight. We were left to sleep. I couldn't really sleep as adrenaline was coursing through my veins, and Cervadil was making me crampy. So, I dozed.\n\n**Tuesday, Apr 4**: At 9am, my doctor came to check on me. Thanks to Cervadil, I had dilated to 3cm, my cervix had effaced to 70%, but it was still anterior and station was still -3/-2. This gave me a Bishop Score of 6. At this point, I was given a couple of options:\n\n1. Start on Pitocin only\n2. Also do AROM (artificial rupture of membranes)\n\nMy gut told me Pitocin only to start, and after discussing it with my doula, that's what we went for. She mentioned that given baby's station, AROM now could get the baby \"stuck\" in my pelvis too high, and well, as much as I was DONE being pregnant, I didn't really feel we needed to rush this thing. So, I got on the drip, and stayed on it with dosage being gradually increased until my next cervical check at 3pm. I was able to tolerate the pain well by incorporating a lot of position changes, and support measures / counter pressure from both my husband and my doula. At 3pm, my doctor checked me and said that I was 4cm dilated, and close to 90% effaced, so we were making progress! We opted to continue doing more of the same. At this point, the contractions were starting to get a bit more painful, so – after some more position changes – I opted to labor in the shower for a bit bringing the water wand with hot water to my abdomen each time a contraction hit. At 6pm, my doctor checked me again, and lo and behold... I was at 8cm, with cervix 90% dilated, and I believe the station had changed to -1/0. We were ALL ELATED. At this point, I was given more options.\n\n1. Continue with Pitocin only\n2. Get an epidural, plus Pitocin\n3. AROM + #2\n\n(Well, I knew that I would need to get an epidural if we did AROM because of what everyone was telling me would happen once we AROMed... PAIN!)\n\nBecause things had been going so well on just Pitocin, and I had been managing my pain level through the various techniques, I once again opted to keep going. At this point, folks in the room (my nurse mostly) mentioned that we were now entering the *In Transition* phase of labor so things would get A LOT MORE painful. She suggested I come up with a \"safe word\" if I did want to get an epidural but I didn't want to employ such gimmicks: I know myself pretty well and I wasn't out to prove anything by not getting an epidural; if I needed one, I would ask for it.\n\nGawd... the rumored pain WAS REAL! The next 2 hours were the most ridiculously painful of my life. I made noises I didn't think were possible for a human to make. Once again, my husband and doula were right there with me with a variety of MORE aggressive support measure and counter pressure, but at this point, NOTHING was able to take my focus off of the pain. Still, looking back, I wouldn't have changed my decision not to get an epidural then, because **now I know what I won't be missing**, if we decide to do this again. (FYI... important advice given to me by our postpartum doula: family planning during labor or immediately postpartum is a really bad idea. Don't do it.)\n\nBy 8pm, the final check of the day, I had progressed to 9cm, was almost completely effaced (but it wasn't 100%), the station had changed to 0, and everything was looking good! At this point, I urgently asked for the anesthesiologist to come and give me an epidural. We also contemplated calling in my doctor to do AROM, but she recommended I get the epidural first, and then call her back with my decision.\n\nBy sheer luck or by grace of God (you pick), the anesthesiologist was next door in the OR, and arrived within 10 min. It could have been as little at 5 min; I was in too much pain to pay close attention to these details. He got to work quickly, and I had my epidural in 15-20 min later. Another 15-20 min later, the pain of the contractions started to subside. However, although I didn't explicitly ask for it (I wasn't capable of expressing anything other than my undying devotion to the anesthesiologist), he gave me a lighter dose of epidural, so although the contractions were much more tame, I could still feel them. The pain just went down from 15 out of 10, to 4-5 out of 10. This was fine by me.\n\nAt this point, we reassessed the plan, and – I really have to give it to my husband here, who had the bright idea of: why don't we all get some rest instead of doing AROM, so that you can have energy to push once we do break your waters and the baby starts coming. BEST. IDEA. EVER. So, I dozed as much as I could considering I was still feeling contractions.\n\nSidebar: the only reason I felt comfortable continuing doing what we'd been doing is that baby's HR remained strong and steady throughout. Once I got the epidural, the nurses noticed some decelerations following a contraction, but these went away after they adjusted my position.\n\n**Birth:**\n\n**Wednesday, Apr 5**: at 4am, the nurse came in and said that the charge nurse asked her to do a cervical check since it had been more than 8 hours since my last one. Turned out that I was fully open, and baby's station had progressed from 0 to +2/+3, so it was GO TIME! My water still hadn't broken by then, so they hauled the barely-awake attending (who happened to be 1 of the 2 doctors in my clinic and whom I had seen for the first 20 weeks of my pregnancy care) and she did AROM at around 4:30am. We called back our doula (who had gone home to catch some zzz's) as pushing was about to start (started at 4:47am).\n\nThis is where I learned the hard lesson of how hard it is to push out a 10lb 8oz baby having never had a baby before. Despite the epidural, I had quite a bit of control over my limbs, so I was able to try pushing in different positions. Unfortunately, I wasn't feeling contractions in all of them, so when my morning nurse came on duty, she suggested a position that used the squat bar and a rebozo which was a game changer. I definitely needed some coaching (even though I had written in my birth pref plan 'no coaching'; but that was a line I had just transferred from a sample birth plan. I definitely appreciated knowing I was doing the right thing.)\n\nAt 8am, the nurse called the doctor as we were in the final stages. I pushed for another 15-20 min, now with the doctor coaching me. She then suggested to \"cough\" as she'd seen that technique work previously. My husband and I gave each other a side look when we heard that (we had watched *What to Expect When Expecting* together) but I proceeded as per her suggestion. I fake coughed a few times and it was enough to get the head out and then the body slipped right out! Exact birth time was 8:30am. The look of bewilderment on the doctor's face when she felt baby's weight was pretty pronounced... late the previous evening she'd predicted he'd be around 9lbs 2oz. He was placed on my chest and the waterworks / sobbing just unleashed. He was HEAVY! And LONG. And PERFECT. \n\n**Post-birth:**\n\nNICU staff were in our room just in case, and baby boy instantly got tagged LGA (large for gestational age). After 10-15 min on my chest, they wanted to do a quick weigh/length measurement before letting me continue with the skin-to-skin / initial latch attempt. That's when we got the weight and length (21.75\" / 55.2cm) measurement. Because of the LGA label, he needed to get his blood sugar levels checked. The first reading came back a bit low (44 I think), so that necessitated 3 more checked, 3 hours apart thereafter. He passed those without any issues.\n\nWhile the gentle giant lay on my chest, the doctor was making quick work on the tearing (which I learned was \"small 3rd degree\"...) and, in hindsight, I do recall a look of concern on her face while she was doing it. She and the nurses worked really fast. I learned later that it's because I was bleeding quite heavily. This manifested itself a few hours later, when I tried sitting up on the side of my bed and nearly passed out (my husband forced me to lie down). We called in the nurse and she took my blood pressure which came up as 79/36 (I think she did a repeat which was slightly higher) but it prompted her to place an urgent call to my doctor, who ordered a CBC (complete blood count), which showed my platelets and hemoglobin plunging rapidly. I continued to feel awful into the afternoon / evening. Going to the bathroom necessitated being \"driven\" on a Sara Steady device and vigilant monitoring by the nurse while I was in there. Later in the afternoon, they opted to hook me up to a catheter again since I didn't have the strength to go to the bathroom as needed.\n\n**Thursday, Apr 6:**  I started to feel a smidge better after eating some trail mix around 2am at which point they disconnected the catheter. Another CBC that morning revealed that my hemoglobin had sank further and was now 7.9 g/dL. My doctor came to check on me a couple of hours later and explained that due to the long labor / big baby, I had lost quite a bit of blood (when I looked at my discharge notes later, it said that estimated blood loss – EBL – was 550cc) and diagnosed me with severe anemia, and offered me a blood transfusion. She said that it would likely make my recovery much faster than an iron infusion (which would take longer to kick in). I briefly discussed with my husband and decided to accept 1 unit of blood because, as I had told my doctor, the idea of going home and caring for a newborn feeling like I was was just unfathomable to me.\n\nThe nurses prepared my transfusion, and 2-3 hours later it was all done. I definitely started to see improvements towards the end of the day. I even managed to take a shower (while seated, of course). The following day, my hemoglobin had risen to 8.3 g/dL which, while still low, was acceptable to my doctor. We got discharged later that day.\n\nThat's about the gist of my birth story. Overall, I was extremely pleased with how many options / leeway I was given throughout. It had been a fear of mine since the hospital where I was birthing was known for their \"medicated births\" and \"get in / get out\" approach. My doula (a former L&D nurse) was instrumental in helping me weigh the options and choose the right one. But, ultimately, even with her advice, I found that my gut was leading me down the right path. I'm also really happy I got the epidural when I did, though next time – if that comes to pass – it will happen sooner.\n\nAnother bonus is that baby latched on amazingly right from the get go, which – given my own extra need for recovery – has been a blessing.\n\nOne more note of importance on the use of the Bishop Score: I had talked to my doula about it and whether or not it’s a useful tool. She basically said that while it’s useful, many doctors tend to “ignore” it and push through with the induction regardless. I asked a bunch of girls in my RESOLVE grad group who had had inductions and it was consistent with their experience. 🤷‍♀️",

    "body": "Strap in- this is a long one. \n\nTLDR: induced at 42 weeks, emergency c-section, almost died.\n\nMy plan from the outset and throughout pregnancy was to have a very hands off, calm birth with as little intervention as possible. I did all the \"right\" things: pre-natal yoga, exercised for as long as possible, hours on a yoga ball every night, kerb walking, squats, red raspberry leaf tea, evening primrose oil, meditations, hypnobirthing course etc to make sure my body AND mind were ready for birth and labour. I had my beautiful birth plan typed and printed but I was always prepared for it to change and new it was something I needed to be flexible with so I kept a very, very open mind while keeping myself positive that I would have my calm water birth. \n\nSo, we get to 40+ weeks and my midwives ask about induction and I say I'd like to wait it out, which they full support, I just have to have weekly monitoring. \n\nNo problem. \n\n41 weeks and the monitoring has been fine until I notice reduced movements. Scans shows a significant decrease fluid so weekly monitoring goes to daily, luckily baby is otherwise fine and very comfortable in there. I was getting more miserable by the day and slowly losing my resolve at spending HOURS every single day sitting around in hospital waiting to get on the CTG, then hours on the CTG and then hours waiting to be told if I could go home. I had severe pelvic instability, severe SI joint instability and still had hyperemesis until the very end so I was uncomfortable, not sleeping, vomiting daily and in so much pain - well and truly over it so we booked an induction for 41+5. \n\nFriday night - the balloon goes in without any issues at all and the doctors and midwives give me so much reassurance that everything looks amazing, favourable cervix etc, that I have a great attitude and they're all really excited for me. The cramping was pretty intense so I barely slept more than 3-4 hours.\n\nSaturday morning - balloon removed, taken to birth suite and my waters are broken. I asked for time to see if my body would up what was being put down but nothing happened so the drip went up and then shit started moving pretty quickly from there. I knew the drip would take things from 0 to 100 really fast and I struggled so much to keep up. The contractions were absolutely fucked and really overwhelming. I tried so hard to keep my head in the game with affirmations, TENS machine, breathing, distractions, movement, the shower, squats, yoga ball - you name it, I did it. At 6pm, during handover, was the first time I heard someone say that his head was tilted and he was looking sideways and presenting ear first. Until this point everyone was cheering me on and saying repeatedly \"he'll be here soon Peach!!\" I had the most incredible support from my midwife, doula and partner. 10 hours in of back to back, relentless and really intense contractions I begged for an epidural. I knew that as soon as I got one that every one of my birth wishes we're gone but I'd also told myself if I was asking for it then I'd reached a point where I knew I needed it and I was completely okay with that. \n\nAnd this is where shit really started going bad. \n\nEpidural goes in after 3 attempts and I'm finally able to be comfortable even though I'm now stuck in bed and got about an hour of sleep. After a few hours I start noticing the contraction pain again and mention to the midwife I have pain and then about 10 minutes later the epidural fails completely and I'm back to the peak of intense contractions with no break -7/8 in 10 minutes because my uterus is over stimulated and I'm literally screaming from how overwhelming the pain is. The anaesthetic team comes back in and another epidural is placed but an hour later that also fails, this time in a matter of seconds and I'm again screaming and begging for help even with the gas and TENS machine maxed out. Anaesthetic team comes back a third time and puts in a spinal block so they can place a third epidural.. except only my right side is numb and completely paralysed and I can still feel everything on the left, it takes almost 2 hours for the left side to finally take effect. \nBy this point I have been in excruciating pain for hours, I haven't eaten or slept and I am exhausted. Baby hadn't moved down for hours and I was stuck at 9cm dilated. We'd tried pushing and I'd been turning and changing position hourly to try and help him move down. But all I kept hearing was he'll be here soon, he's almost here, you're so close, you can do this!!! I already knew in my bones at that point that was stuck and wasn't coming out on his own. By now it's about 4am and I've been in labour for around 18 hours and I started asking for a c-section. \n\nThe overnight obsetetric doctor was an incredibly kind man and really listened to me. He came in probably 3-4 times and each time was really confident I'd deliver vaginally and didn't need a c-section. By the 4th visit I told him that the next time he came in if I didn't have a baby then I wanted a c-section. \n\nCome 7am and he does another vaginal exam and tells me that baby hasn't progressed since 5-6pm the night before, I'm still at 9cm and baby is still presenting ear first with his head tilted and that he is well and truly stuck and finally agrees to a c-section because by this point I'm just suffering and we're 22 hours into labour and I have nothing left and baby is starting to get stressed and the epidural is wearing off again. \n\nEverything pre-theater goes well - epidural is repositioned and worked beautifully, the staff in theatre were incredibly nice, I had a fresh midwife (3rd one from how long I'd been in labour) and everything is good to go. The surgeon does a vaginal exam and says I'm 10cm and offers to do an episiotomy and trial of forceps but I firmly say no as this was the absolute number one thing I was hell bent on avoiding. They put knife to skin and I'm calm, my partner is calm, everyone is calm. \n\nAnd then they ask for \"pressure\" on my chest and it feels like someone is doing CPR on me to try and get the baby out. I can feel CRAZY amounts of pressure and pulling and my whole body is being moved around. Baby is lifted out and I hear yelling from behind the curtain for more clamps, no delayed cord clamping hurry and take the baby NOW.\nMy partner and I both get teary and I hear him crying and then tell my partner to go be with him. \n\nI then immediately feel sick, like I'm going to die and vomit all over myself multiple times. I remember suddenly feeling like the energy completely drained from my body and all I remember is yelling and more people coming in. The anaesthetists start giving me drug after drug after drug and I felt so incredibly tired that I couldn't keep my eyes open, all I wanted to do was sleep. I told my partner to hold the baby because I physically couldn't move myself or speak, I remember kissing the baby and not a lot else. He came out covered in thick meconium but otherwise completely health at over 4kgs.\n\nIt turns out my blood pressure absolutely bombed, I lost 1.5L of blood which took over an hour to control and my bowels popped out. I was really, really unwell and narrowly avoided being intubated and put into ICU.\n\nI don't remember anything about the recovery after coming out of theatre. All I remember is waking up hours later in a hospital room with a baby on my chest and my exhausted partner sitting next to me waiting for me to wake up. \n\nHe started to fill me in on what happened and how bad things got. We hadn't told anyone but my sister that the induction was happening (which was such a smart idea because we could just get on with things) so when he told me he'd let his parents know that the baby was here, he burst into tears. We were both so exhausted and overwhelmed at everything. The first few days were very hard with recovery, the blood loss taking a toll, getting to know this new baby!!! \n\nFast forward to a few weeks later and everyone is doing incredibly well. We are all happy and healthy and I can very confidently say that I do not feel any trauma or otherwise about my birth. \n\nI'm just fucking glad that I'm not pregnant anymore!!!! \n\nIf you made is this far, thank you for your time!!!!",

    "body": "Background: I’m in the US with a group a midwives practicing at at a large university hospital. Hired a doula and was very committed to an unmedicated birth. Took classes, ate dates and drank RRL tea out the whazoo. Hip circles on yoga ball throughout entire pregnancy, but for hours every day in the last couple weeks. I also inserted evening primrose oil into my vagina starting at 39 weeks. Did some curb walking and miles circuits in the last few days. Never got a cervical check, so unsure how my progress was when labor started.\n\nStory: My water broke in the car ~5pm on New Years Eve on the way home from picking up wings for my husband’s birthday (also January 1st!). I was laughing and felt a gush of fluid, but honestly things had gotten a little crazy down there so I didn’t think it was my water at first. Then a ton of fluid came out when I was not laughing and I figured there was a chance it was my water. When we got home I ate the wings and then got into polar bear position for 20 mins as I had learned to do in my class. When I flipped back over a HUGE gush of liquid came out. It was tinged brownish yellowish (almost) greenish so I thought it might be meconium. Doula and midwife had me send pics and said it was not meconium- phew!\n\nThey instructed me to go to sleep and wait for contractions and if I had none to call in the morning and they’d get me to do a castor oil induction. About 930pm, contractions started coming regularly and were strong enough that I wouldn’t have been able to sleep through them. So unfortunately neither my husband nor I got an ounce of sleep that night.\n\nI labored with only my hubs until about 1:30am when I called my doula. At that point I was in the shower and contractions were getting pretty strong. She told me to labor about another hour and call her back. She ended up coming to our house around 3:30am. I was in the tub and definitely needed her support, as did my husband at that point. She helped me try various positions, which were mostly very uncomfortable but helped me progress quicker.\n\nWe left for the hospital around 7am. My contractions were still fairly spaced apart at that point (every ~4 minutes) but they were very strong and I was starting to get a bit of an urge to push. When we got to the hospital, I must have been going through transition because I had 9 contractions on the walk from the parking deck to L&D and by the time I got to our room in L&D I was unable to NOT push.\n\nMidwife checked me and said baby was at +3 station. They brought out some little bars for me to squat on. My husband sat behind me and I pushed for about 20 minutes. I'm not 100% sure what was going on, but there was some talk about issues with the baby's heart rate (? they didn't make a big deal about it, but I could tell something was up and so could my husband). They were really encouraging me to push hard and strong, so I did end up tearing, despite warm compress and olive oil.\n\nFrom check in at L&D to birth was 39 minutes. What a whirlwind. As soon as baby came out, I was instantly in love and it was worth every second of labor to have her in my arms! They stitched me up (4 stitches between two 2nd degree tears) and had to pull a clot out of my cervix, which hurt like a mother fucker, but baby was snuggling in my arms so all was good.\n\nETA: My milk is already in! My boobs started feeling porn star rock hard in the middle of the night last night. Experiencing let down for the first time was bizarre… things are about to get messy around here haha",

    "body": "Dear Bumpers, \n\nThis /r has been invaluable in getting me through my pregnancy so I would like to provide my help to other first time moms in getting to the \"beyond\". \n\n\nHere are the lessons I learned from my pregnancy/birth/first 3 weeks with baby:\n\n1. Take it easy the last few weeks of your pregnancy. I was working well past my due date (baby was a week late) and was stressed till the very end. It makes for a crappy first week with baby. \n\n\n2. IMO, evening primrose oil helps, not to kick start labor but to dilate the cervix. A week before my due date I was closed, no dilation/effacement whatsoever. After a week of taking one capsule orally and using 1-2 vaginally, I reached 1 cm dilation and 80% effacement. It's anecdotal but just putting it out there\n\n\n3. Do not fret over your due date. Forget it or reset your mental calendar to a week later. Better yet tell everyone it's a week later. The pressure of everyone asking whether baby has arrived is not one you need. The baby WILL come out - I spent a week wondering if my body was \"broken\". That's BS. I delivered my baby on 41 weeks + 1 day which is the national average. \n\n\n4. for natural induction, what worked for me was accupuncture. But a cautionary note. It will not work if your body is not ready yet. Consider it more like \"greasing the wheels\". My first visit the doc felt my uterus and said I wasn't \"Ready\" yet - I was like whatev - I'm already past my due date...sure enough the visit started contractions but they petered out....the next visit my uterus seemed more ready. I also followed her directions of walking for 3 hours straight after the visit - my labor started for real that night. \n\n\n5. This is so important I will put it all in caps. IF YOU INTEND TO HAVE AN UNMEDICATED LABOR YOU MUST SLEEP DURING EARLY LABOR. this is the single most important piece of information I have. I went through 2 days of \"false\" labor. Contractions were 6-8 mins apart without stopping from friday evening until monday morning. Mainly because my baby was OP. This shit will tire the F* out of you. I tried to sleep but should have tried harder. When monday morning came, active labor started but I had not slept in 48 hours and was on the verge of collapsing. I begged for an epidural 5 cms in not because of the pain but because I JUST NEEDED TO SLEEP FOR 30 MINS.  Do not make this mistake. Do not stay awake counting/ measuring contractions. TRUST ME you will know when you are in active labor. \n\n\n6. What does labor feel like? Braxton hicks felt like a little bit of gas pains...the more sure way to tell is to feel ur tummy. If it feels hard, wait for a minute or 2 and then feel it again. Is it soft now? then yes, you had a contraction. It is common to feel it more when walking. \nEarly labor is more well defined contractions. They start with an edge like a period cramp, increase slowly and then ease away fully. There is no pain in between contractions at all. Active labor you will absolutely know - having a conversation between contractions sucks. All you want to do is gather your breath and wait for the next one to hit. You cannot focus on anything other than what is happening inside you. I waited until I had 3 contractions in 10 mins before heading to the hospital. \n\n\nctd in comments\n",

        "body": "7. It's good to have a plan but \"go with the flow\". In my case I was not against getting an epidural, I wanted to push it out to the point where I knew it would not stall my labor. For me in fact epidural helped. Here's how: After 48 hours of labor, I started having double contractions (due to my OP baby). so 2 would come togetehr and then a break and so on...This became too hard for me to take on top of the sleep deprivation. I could not relax for a second and was actually clenching my entire body through EVERY ctx. My midwife and doula tried to get me to relax every way possible, hot water, massage, etc yada...nothing worked...nothing they said entered my head....,my brain was screaming SLEEEEEEP (hence (5)). Four hours in I got my epidural, the next second I was asleep. I went from the peak of pain to bliss of no pain in about 5 mins, literally fell asleep on my SO who was holding me (he thought I had fainted). I woke up 4 hours later fully dilated and ready to push. I also instantly went from 3cm to 5cm the minute they gave me the epidural. My MW said I was clenching so hard I was not allowing my cervix to dilate and the minute I fell asleep my body worked on its own to progress labor. Needless to say I am one of those few cases where the epidural helped instead of stalling labor. I am glad I changed my mind and did not stick to some \"plan\" of no epidural. I could have been in active labor for hours and would have most likely got it anyways. \n\n\nPOST-BABY TIPS:\n\n\n1) After the birth if you get stitches, go easy on the narcs. The hospital will push these on you (the drug dealers ). However a little known fact is that narcs cause severe constipation which you will suffer through later. IF you are in serious pain then do take the pills. as the second piece of this you will be hungry after labor and will want to EAT all things. Desist. You are going to have to poop it out later. Seriously not fun. Eat simple fibrous foods, stick to liquid if you can, after the first BM eat away. \n\n\n2. Depends Vs. Pads: Honestly I did not bleed much. The hospital size giant maxi pads are good but they do not stay in place when you lay down. So I put on depends over it, to help keep it in place. I only used this setup for 2-3 days and then switched to regular maxi pads. \n\n\n3. First poop/ bowel moment. SIGH. I could write a whole post on this. It was harder than pushing the baby out (I am not kidding - I had no epidural for this remember). I suffered for 2 days clinging to the toilet seat waiting for poop to happen. and I Was in so much pain from the stitches and being off the narcs. I cursed every bit of food that I ate before. The only way I survived was by sitting in warm water while pooping. TMI I know. But remember this if you are sitting for an hour clinging to the toilet in so much pain that you are crying, just fill up ur bath tub with warm water and poop in there. It is so much easier and well worth the effort of cleaning the tub. I understood afetr this experience why women prefer water births. I wish you all an easy poop and would not have wished those few days on my very worst enemy. \n\n\n4. DAY 4 does not equal DAY 10. I was so broken on the second day after I came home. Milk had not come in yet, baby was screming, I was in pain from stitches and constipation. I just wanted out and wished I had never had a baby. 10 days later I was pooping normally, milk was well in and DAY 4 was barely a memory. IT WILL GET BETTER I promise. Just keep telling yourself that. \n\n\n5. Breastfeeding Vs. Formula: I have only one hint: IF you can stick it out until your milk comes in you have won half the battle. ther will be tons of pressure from ur in laws spouse etc to give the baby just a few ounces of formula when he is screaming in hunger. resist. you both will live through this and once the lovely milk comes in you will all be happier. \n\n\n6. Ok I lied I have one more hint. two words: NIPPLE SHIELD. Ok so I don't recommend everyone run out and buy one. Here;s how you know if you need one: If you are in the first week, your nipple are sore and bleeding because ur baby has not figured out latching yet and is so hungry he is trying to eat it :) and if you have tears running down your face as your are trying to get him to latch - then please please get a nipple shield. It saved my sanity and instantly made a difference. Of course it doesnt help if you have any serious problems with milk etc. but for a regular person with broken nipples due to a bad first week - a nipple shield is the difference between switching to formula and staying with BF. My baby did get used to it and I could not wean him off, I still use it. But I checked and there are no down sides to using one as far as I know. \n\n\n7. Ask people for help but Do your own thing. Every one will have ideas and suggestions - sort through them and pick the ones that you feel make sense. I hope you have atleast one good friend who has been through this recently whom you can text for help. If not come to beyond the bump - the ladies there are superhelpful. \n\nThat's it moms! Have a great pregnancy , a fantastic labor and an easy first poop ;) \n\nEdit: Ladies please make note of the cons regarding using a shield in the comments.",

I had to use one with Jude because he was hooked on the feel of bottle nipples so we had to use a shield to get him to even think about latching on. Anyway the LC at the hospital told me that I should not become dependent on it, and try to get him off of it as soon as possible because for some people it decreases the extra stimulation they need from baby's tongue on their nipple to properly increase their supply. That turned out to be true for me and my supply never recovered.",

    "body": "Birth Story, Airis Olivia\n\nEarly Labor\n\nI apologize but I already know that this is going to be very long.  The reason being that when I would read other’s birth stories I had always wished that there was more detail.  Being a first time mom and attempting a natural birth was nerve wreaking and I wanted to really know what I was getting into.  We used the hypnobabies program, so you will notice that the terminology in this is different, for example a contraction was called a pressure wave, this was meant to take the negative context out of labor and help me remain calm. \n\nWell, I suppose my labor started as early as nearly three weeks ago.  I was right 35 weeks and went to the hospital to find I was at 2cm. I was given a shot to stop everything and was sent home not too much later.   A week following I was at work and again, starting having some heavy cramping.  I timed everything and found that they were about three minutes apart.  I went ahead and called the midwife and she said to come in so we can stop everything again if things to stop on their own in an hour.  Well, they stopped… \n\nThen, last week I had an appointment with the midwife and she decided to check  me since I had been having some pressure waves. The whole process was very confusing for me because none of the waves had been remotely uncomfortable.  Everything felt like light cramping.  When she checked me though I was a 4cm and she said that if things started back up I was almost 37 weeks and the baby seemed great, they would let it continue.  \n\nWith that I was on a mission.  My plan was to wait until Monday, when I hit 37 weeks exactly and then do everything I could at that point to self induce labor.  I was ready.  Gestational diabetes, swelling issues, PUPPS, and complete lack of energy had me wanting nothing more than to have that baby!  My husband and I spend the weekend cleaning and Monday we were ready.  Long story short the next couple of days were filled with acupuncture, chiropractic, raspberry leaf tea, evening primrose oil, sex, walking, baby come out track, and several false alarms. By Thursday I was ready to give up, convinced I would be pregnant forever.  It was so frustrating to know in my heart she was ready to come out, and being so ready to see her, having spent weeks almost going into labor and then when we are finally ready nothing,\n\nWell, fast forward to Thursday morning.  I rolled over to my exhausted husband attempting to initiate, once again, some labor inducing sex.   This time though I was convinced it would not work and decided I just wanted to be intimate with my man while I still had the chance.  Afterward I took a long shower and we decided to watch some TV.  Once again as we sat there I started having some light cramps.  They started out about ten minutes apart and quickly progressed to three.  After an hour or so of that I decided again to call the midwife.  We pressed pause on our show and I gave her a call.  She told us to come in.  We packed up the car and left our show on pause, sure we would be back in a couple of hours.  \n\nToday IS The Day\n\nWhen we arrived at the midwife’s office she hooked us up to a monitor.  The baby sounded great and my pressure waves really were 3 minutes apart.  It was so great to see that I was not crazy.  After a little while she checked me again and I was at 5!  My husband and I were so excited.  She said because we lived about 40  minutes away she would get us a room at the hospital and see where things went from there.  She also said if I really wanted this baby today she had no problem coming over to check on me in a couple hours and breaking my water.  Originally I had it in my birth plan that I did not want my water broken, but things had changed.  I was so ready! I discussed it with my husband, who was worried about things progressing too quickly and me losing my ability to stay in hypnosis.  We decided though that progressing quickly would be better than so slowly that by the time she was ready to come out I was so exhausted that it would be really tough.  \n\nWe arrived at the hospital and I was lucky enough to get the only room with a tub! A couple of hours later the midwife did come and I was almost at 7, we decided to break my water.   I was nervous this would be painful but I could hardly feel it.  Things began to progress pretty quickly from there and I got into the top and was finally ready to play some hpynobabies.  My husband was so wonderful during this time. He was so attentive, each time I closed my eyes to ride out another wave he would say something from the hypnobabies script or remind me of my special place or place a cold cloth on my head.  Despite the fact that the waves were becoming more intense I can honestly say they were not painful.  With every wave I relaxed deeper, and despite the fact that a couple of hours passed like that it felt like 15 minutes. \n\nWe were so blessed to have an amazing nurse who really just left us alone.  She loved natural birth and knew the hypnobabies lingo.  Finally when I began to feel some pressure we paged her in and she and my husband helped me out of the tub.  It really felt like I needed to have bm but I knew I didn’t because I had tried earlier to use the toilet and nothing happened.  They checked me again and I was at 9cm.   At this point I was pretty uncomfortable. Laying on my back to be checked was really unpleasant and I started having doubts in my ability to do give natural birth. I turned to my midwife and asked for some Tylenol, she laughed “Tylenol is not going to do anything for you now.”  Then I begged for gas, I was really just delusional at that point and I knew that it was too late to get anything. What made things so uncomfortable was the feeling that I had to poop but couldn’t.  Then right at that moment someone knocked on the door, my nurse answered and my friend Angela was there to come and see me.  I was so angry I yelled “Tell her to go away!”  It was honestly pretty funny.  My midwife explained that that was the baby and that I was welcome to sit on the toilet to see that it was just the baby or I could try pushing.   I did not want to get up so I decided I would try to push, even though I was really nervous about pooping in front of people which was causing my body to hold her in.  My midwife suggested I roll over on my hands and knees and I would be more comfortable.  She was right, as soon as I got in that position I felt so much relief.  Meanwhile, this whole time my husband was pressing on my forehead and leaning into my ear telling me how amazing I was and that I was doing so well and she would be out so soon.  I honestly could not have done that without him.\n\nWhen I rolled over I was given permission to start pushing.  I was so nervous it was really just a bm but finally I did not care.  With the next pressure wave I pushed as hard as I could.  Then, even when it stopped I kept pushing.  Another wave came and I took in a deep breath and pushed again.  I was totally in the zone ready to push again when I looked down and there was my baby, placed right below me.  I could not believe it.  It was so fast.  My midwife later told me she had never seen anyone push like that before and my nurse said that I was made to have babies. Because of the baby’s position they had expected me to push for around an hour, instead I pushed for less than 5 minutes.  Apparently the table was not even set up and my midwife only had one glove on.  My husband said he saw her turn away as I pushed the first time and then look back and jump forward so she could catch the baby.  \n\nI have to say hypnobabies is really amazing.  Despite the fact that I lost it there for a few minutes I know that without the hypnosis tools I learned I would not have persevered.  Honestly for me I think the only reason I had any discomfort was because of how quickly things escalated at the end.  Really, I only had about 20 minutes of real discomfort.  My nurse told me that at 7 and 8 cm I was acting the way most women do at 3 and 4 cm.   Honestly I am glad too I really felt things at the end.  I hit a wall and seriously did not think I could do it, I wanted to give up but I bore down and pushed her out. That was truly the most empowering experience of my life, I feel like I can do anything now.  Also, I have never felt so close to my husband, he was such an amazing birth partner.  He was so supportive and his words of encouragement were truly empowering to me as I had the baby.  \n\nSo, Thursday, August 30 at 10pm, Airis Olivia was born 6 pounds 9 ounces, with the cutest blond hair ever.  She is such a cool baby. Breastfeeding is tougher than I thought it would be but we are doing it.  My husband and I could not be more happy.  I am so in love and I am so glad I had a natural unmediated birth.  Thanks for reading. I will have to post a pic here soon too! ☺ \n",

    "body": "I’m only 36 hours post delivery and already the experience feels like a dream that didn’t really happen!  \n\nI had cramping and sporadic contractions all of last week, mostly at night. I would get excited thinking labor was beginning just for things to pass, super frustrating. Because I had gone overdue, I was doing all of the things to try and naturally induce- raspberry leaf tea, nipple stimulation, dates, sex, evening primrose oil, acupuncture, etc... I don’t know that any of these really made a difference. I had a membrane sweep scheduled for Monday that I was dreading.  \n\nFriday night I had semi regular contractions that I could manage just with breathing technique. I called my midwife the next morning and she said to keep her in the loop about how things progressed, it could be hours or days until things really ramped up and there was no way to know. We went and bought some last minute freezer meals and the mild contractions continued until around 7pm when things really kicked up. I was relying on props, positioning, and massage to get through contractions, but still was able to talk and felt like myself during the rests. My partner called the midwife and she said she *could* come if we wanted, but it sounded like early labor still. I told her I was still managing okay on my own and we would be in touch.  \n\nWe went to the bedroom to try and lay down and rest. I threw up once, and then things really barreled ahead so quickly. My contractions were coming with only a minute in between to recover and the pain was so intense. I started moving through a series of spontaneous positions, it felt like the only thing I could do in the moment. Bouncing on a yoga ball, bracing against the changing table, kneeling over an ottoman. My partner was doing his best to offer counter pressure and massage, but I didn’t want him to touch me at all. I told him to call the midwife again, and she was on her way.  \n\nBy the time the midwife arrived to our home,  we were in the bathroom and I was sitting on the toilet bracing against a support rod. She looked in my underwear and saw bloody show and mucus, and told my partner to start preparing the birth pool. I moved to kneeling in front of the tub and still using the rod for support while my midwife coached me through the contractions. She was so calming and assuring and kept reminding me that I was going to meet my baby tonight. She was telling me to enjoy the rest between the contractions, but there seriously was none, they were coming in continuous waves one after another, and I was moaning and cussing loudly. Pretty soon my contractions were ending with an intense urge to push. The midwife told me to try not to push yet, it was too early, but I told her I couldn’t stop myself and there was too much pressure in my vagina. We moved to the couch in the living room for her to examine my cervix, only she never got to, because she felt the baby’s head! She told me Well nevermind, go ahead and push as hard as you want to! The midwife’s assistant arrived shortly after. I was already on the couch, and the pool wasn’t yet filled, so that was where I delivered my baby. My partner held my foot and it was honestly a relief to push compared to the contractions. My midwife continued to coach me, and soon she and my partner saw the baby’s dark head of hair! This was all the motivation I needed and she was delivered after about 10 minutes total of pushing. The ring of fire hurt sooo much but only lasted a moment. I got to reach down myself and place her on my chest, the midwife’s assistant cleared her nasal passages and she started crying. I was laughing hysterically from the bliss of that moment! We had waited until that moment to find out the sex- a healthy, perfect 9lb 8oz baby girl. I delivered the placenta easily, and my partner cut the cord.  \n\nI then got to thoroughly enjoy my golden hour with my beautiful new daughter. She latched on as I was being stitched up for a mild second degree tear, which I barely even registered because I was so high watching my baby latch to my breast. Then, we transitioned to the birth pool for a mommy baby bath. She continued to nurse and my partner fed me peaches and chocolate and the assistant made me tea; We lit a candle and sang happy birthday to the baby. It was a really intense experience and active labor was the most pain I’ve ever felt in my life, but I wouldn’t change a single thing!\n\nOk now to try and sneak in a nap. Thanks for reading my birth story!",

    "body": "Okay, listen. I am not into a bunch of hippy-dippy voodoo. This baby won't be born on top of a mountain with my spirit animal in attendance. We're doing this the old fashioned way: In a hospital, quick and dirty like it's 1962. \n\nThat said, there's been some talk of induction, lately for a variety of reasons. I'm not opposed, but I don't want to have a c-section and I'm not super excited about things like foley bulbs or backhoes or whatever they use to get things going if you aren't at least a little dilated.\n\nSo, I've been looking into it and apparently EPO is supposed to help. It doesn't induce and you're not going to go into labor from taking it. It's as harmless as having sex or eating pineapple, but like sex and pineapples, it helps your body produce prostaglandins and soften your cervix. So, when your body is READY, you'll efface and dilate easier. \n\nI've been taking this stuff in small doses since week 34 (1300mg capsule daily). Week 36, I got braver and took two daily. Week 37, lost a bit of MP and started experiencing MANY signs of labor, but contractions wouldn't stick around. Sunday, I finally got the nerve to take two, vaginally, and last night started losing quarter-sized pieces of my MP every time I pee. I'm 38 weeks, tomorrow, and this morning I've got back ache AND the feeling of period cramps.\n\nMy findings are not conclusive and I have an internal, later today, but I'm pretty sure this stuff is workin'. \n\n**Edit: My doctor knows about this. A nurse at our hospital birthing class told us to rub olive oil into our taints to reduce the risk of tearing. I joked with the doc that I'd been looking into it and it didn't seem worse than pouring salad dressing on my taint. He laughed and gave me the okay. He doesn't believe it works, but said \"Meh. You can try it.\" So, obviously, ask your doctor. This is not a prescription, just an observation.**\n\nUpdate: So, it's all good news. I'm 1 cm and 50% effaced, which is awesome and I'll take it. It also means that, even though I've been taking this stuff for a few weeks, it clearly didn't accelerate labor or bring on any rapid changes. Still totally on track to make it close to 40 weeks. ",

Of course, I then proceeded to have amazingly clear skin!\n\nLuckily(?!) I recently went through a rough week at work where I didn't get much sleep and compensated by drinking lots of coffee. I've long suspected that milk breaks me out, and 2 lattes every day for a week was enough to give me a nice cyst on my cheek.\n\nWithout further ado, here's the [album](http://imgur.com/a/fkONN)! The first photo was taken on 19 April and the last photo was taken today.\n\nI'm very impressed with both products!! In a little less than a month it has almost completely faded the pih left over from the cyst! I scar really easily and it would have taken me months to fade something like this. \n\nMy routine is as follows:\n\nDay\n\n* Splash with water and tone with Tosowoong Propolis mist;\n\n* Skinceuticals CE Ferulic serum, wait for 10-15mins;\n\n* LJH Vita Propolis Ampoule;\n\n* Nature Republic Argan 20° Steam Emulsion mixed with a drop of Nature Republic Argan 20° Real Ampoule or GoW Rosehip seed oil;\n\n* Sunscreen - currently Biore Aqua Rich Watery Gel.\n\nNight\n\n* Wash with Kose Softymo White Cleansing Oil followed by either Hada Labo foaming wash or Innisfree Jeju Bija Anti-Trouble Cleansing gel;\n\n* Tone with Tosowoong Propolis mist;\n\n* Two or three times a week I'll use either the Paula's Choice 2% BHA or 8% AHA - wait 15-20mins;\n\n* On nights when I don't use an AHA or BHA, I'll use Retin-A 0.025% gel;\n\n* Melano CC Intensive Anti-Spot Essence;\n\n* Holy Snails Shark Sauce;\n\n* LJH Tea Tree 90 Cream mixed in with a few drops of Evening Primrose Oil.",

    "body": "I've read this reddit consistently for the last three years but haven't ever posted. Just wanted to go on here and say how great this subreddit is and how much I appreciate all the incredible pieces of advice and research!! You're all the best. \n\nThrough this subreddit I've tried so many different things to deal with my hormonal acne. From milk thistle supplements, retinol, evening primrose oil, not eating sugar for a year, PCOS check-up, barrier repair, etc (not at the same time obviously) over the years. Really absoltuely anything.\n\nAt a certain point, I realised that the only thing I had left to try was Accutane so I went on a low dose with my derm's recommendation. Then when I started getting a little bit of side effects I learned to supplement with fish oil + antihistamine (loratadine) on the advice of this subreddit, which has been an absolute game changer.\n\nI'm 6 months in now and have barely had any negative side effects from the Accutane besides 5 days of weird skin texture when I started & when I slightly increased my dosage. And the effect it's had on my skin is incredible, not to mention how much stress it's removed from my life. I'm only hoping it all continues along this trajectory, fingers crossed! So I just wanted to say thank you so much to all the lovely people on this subreddit for all your help over the past couple of years!",

    "body": "http://imgur.com/qKs1cHq           I was 38 weeks and ready to have our baby!  At the last doctor’s appointment, I was 2 cm dilated and 80 % effaced.  I had been trying everything to get him out – walking, spicy foods, sex, evening primrose oil.  Finally, I thought I’d try the dreaded castor oil.  Well, 12 hours later, at about 3 a.m. (after a busy night of cooking for friends, our A/C going out -and then getting fixed by family-and our 2 year old having diarrhea all over herself while she slept), contractions started.  The difference between Braxton Hicks and real contractions is that these were timeable.  I knew exactly when they started and stopped because there was noticeable, cramp-like pain.  After about an hour, I woke up my husband, called the doctor, and dropped off our toddler Hope with the inlaws.  We were at the hospital about 5 a.m.  On the way there, contractions were 2-3 minutes apart.  When I was checked out in triage, I was 4 ½ cm dilated – yay!  We got our own huge room in labor and delivery, but my contractions had slowed down to every 4 minutes.  Thankfully, my doctor came on call at 7 a.m. and broke my water, which speeded things up again.  My husband, my mother and two sisters (ages 26 and 16) were in the room, where they massaged my hands and feet, which was heavenly.  My aunts and grandparents also stopped by throughout the morning.  Finally, contractions were so strong that I could not talk through them, and breathing was not helping the pain.  I was closing my eyes and moaning through them.  When I was 7 ½ cm dilated, I asked for the epidural and got it really quickly – within 15 minutes, which was an answer to prayer.  It wasn’t that bad at all, and nothing compared to the contractions.  The anesthesiologist wiped off my back and then put the needle it – I purposely did not look because I’m queasy, but relief was pretty swift.  I could still feel touch and pressure, just not the sharp pain.  I expected to be completely numb, but instead it was just tingly, like when your arm falls asleep.  I could feel a contraction coming on because of the pressure, but it didn’t hurt, which was weird.  I dilated to a 10 and was ready to push, but we had to wait until my doctor came out of surgery, so we just hung out and talked.   Again, thank goodness for the epidural.  He checked on me and I pushed for an hour and a half, which seemed like forever.  I looked in the mirror and could see the baby’s head come to the front, and then suck back in after I stopped pushing.  That was discouraging.  The nurse tried to get me to rest during a few contractions, but my body just kept pushing.  Also, the baby’s heart rate started decelerating when the contractions came.  I was afraid we would have to do another c-section after all.  Finally, I was exhausted and didn’t think I could push any longer.  We prayed aloud for the baby to come out quickly.  On the next contraction, my doctor checked on me, and I pushed the baby’s head out!  He told me to stop pushing (which was really difficult), and he suctioned baby’s nose and mouth, then I pushed the shoulders and the rest of the body out.  Noah was all white from the vernix on his skin.  I got to hold him immediately and just said, “It’s MY baby boy!”  Daniel cut the cord, then they cleaned him up, and started rushing around.  Apparently, Noah had swallowed some mucus, so they took him to the nursery and suctioned out lots of gunk.  We didn’t get him back until 5 hours later.  Thankfully, after that, he is completely healthy.  I had second degree tears, which took about 30 unpleasant minutes to stitch up, especially because I didn’t have my baby to distract me.  Post partum, I’ve been surprised at how painful recovery has been from the vaginal birth.  Just sitting down is uncomfortable.  I’m only 2 weeks out, so hopefully it will get better soon.  Noah Daniel was born on August 14, 2015 at 3:21p.m. at 7 pounds, 11 ounces, and 21 inches long.  He latched fairly quickly with nursing and sleeps really soundly, both of which are answers to prayer also.  Let me know if you have any questions!",

    "body": "I wasn't super active here during my pregnancy but loved reading other birth stories while I was pregnant so I thought I would share mine! My baby is now four weeks old. I was originally due May 26th and due to my baby measuring on the smaller side my midwife did not want me to go into my 41st week. At my 39 week appointment I was about 1cm dilated and 80% effaced. My midwife swept my membranes and then scheduled me for an induction a week later on May 29th in the event I had not gone into labor on my own before then. I had been having contractions on and off for about a week at that point and had my bloody show the day before so I was hopeful my body was gearing up to do something on its own. I continued to have contractions throughout the week and had more bloody show Wednesday and Thursday. I drank red raspberry leaf tea, took evening primrose oil, and bounced on a yoga ball but unfortunately my labor never really got going so Sunday night my DH and I went out for a last date night before baby and got ready for our induction the next morning. \n\nWe went into the hospital at 7:30am and got settled in our room. The midwife came in to check my progress and decide on a plan for induction. I was about 3 centimeters dilated and since I was still having contractions I was started on pitocin straight away rather than a cervical ripener. Pitocin was started around 9:30 and I walked laps around the hallway to attempt to get my contractions ramped up. Around 10:30 my midwife came in and broke my water which felt disgustingly like peeing my pants. Contractions had been relatively mild up until that point but they became way more intense once my water was broken. I was able to breathe through them for a while but eventually decided to have an epidural placed around 12. Getting the actual epidural wasn't terrible but it was hard to stay still during the 4 or 5 contractions I had while they were placing it. Strangely my blood pressure increased after receiving the epidural. It actually stayed high following delivery and I had to start on medication to get it back down which I am now weaning off. Once I had the epidural I was able to nap for a few hours which was amazing because I had not slept well the night before. \n\nThe midwife decided to come back to check my progress around 4 and left. Around 3pm I began to feel pressure like I had to poop and when the nurse came in she decided to check me. To my surprise I was fully dilated so things began moving quickly to get the room set up for delivery. She asked me to try not to push until the midwife was there as the baby was very low already. The midwife returned around 4 and I began to push about 4:15. My epidural had worn off quite a bit at this point so I could feel when to push and move my legs pretty well. I pushed for a little less than an hour and at 5:12 I felt the ring of fire and looked down to see my baby girl. She was tangled up in her umbilical cord but it hadn't caused any issues during labor or delivery so we got to do skin to skin immediately and were able to breastfeed. I ended up with a second degree tear and one on my labia which were stitched up. Baby girl weighed 7lbs 2oz and was 20.5 inches long.\n\nBaby tax: https://imgur.com/a/CH08v",

I am also a biopharmaceutical scientist.\n\nLike many other women's posts I read on here, I was bleeding pretty consistently after getting Nexplanon.  \nI read a lot of posts about women who had success with Evening Primrose Oil (EPO) to stop this.\n\nI read some research articles, and long story short, my theory is that the gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) in EPO is what helps, because sustained progesterone levels (nexplanon releases constant progesterone vs our body's natural up/down cycle) interferes with an inflammatory process that contributes to the bleeding. I added two tablespoons of hemp hearts (a food naturally high in GLA) from Costco to my morning oatmeal. All of my bleeding has stopped. I ran out of hemp hearts two weeks ago, and immediately started bleeding. I am now back on 2 tablespoons of hemp hearts a day and no blood in sight. Hope this post helps other women experiencing this. I also have some Borage Oil on hand (higher in GLA than EPO), and those capsules work when I am out of hemp seeds. Work up the dosage each day until the bleeding stops, and then lower the dose as needed for bleeding prevention. I haven't needed to take consistently high doses (I try to make the hemp/capsules last as long as possible)\n\nHope this helps give insight to someone out there. I've had a great experience with Nexplanon outside of this. \n\nPlease come back and comment your experience if you give this a try!",

    "body": "I'm so excited that I actually get to share my birth story finally! It has been a crazy few weeks, so sorry it's a little late and for the wall of text.\n\nMy labor started about a week prior to giving birth. Well false labor anyways. I was quite disappointed when on saturday my midwife sent me home because my contractions had stopped. At this point I was now 2 weeks overdue. She wasn't concerned at all, saying that I didn't have high blood pressure, my weight was fine, he just didn't want to come out. She told me that when you have contractions that stop it takes about 24 hours for them to start up again.  So no baby on saturday.\n\nSo at this point I had tried EVERYTHING to get this baby out! Evening primrose oil, sex, bumpy rides, sex, spicy food, pineapples, pumping, long walks, caster oil (never again!) and more sex. Nothing was getting this baby out.\n\nSo I was getting more and more anxious as the days went on, and tuesday night, around 5pm they started again. And immediately they were 5 minutes apart. I timed them for almost 4 hours and no change, just 5 minutes apart. They weren't painful, just uncomfortable. I finally called my midwife and she told me that when I have a hard time breathing through them, to call her again. \n\nOh, I should mention that we have to go 90 miles to get to the birthing center.\n\nSo around 10 pm they just stop. And I have a complete break down! I am so tired of being pregnant and not knowing when he is coming out and I'm tired etc. My poor husband just didn't quite know what to do with me at that point!  So we decide to watch a few episodes of Breaking Bad and then call it a night. We get into bed a little after midnight and I just start to cry again. Like we are talking hysterical can't breath sobbing. And so I start to pray/plead to God to help my body go into labor. I finally calm down and just lay there thinking.  And of course I'm not comfortable at all! I look at the clock and it's 12:54 and decide to roll over and try to get to the point where I can sleep for a few hours. Well as I roll over, my water breaks. I wasn't really sure if it was my water, because there wasn't a lot a fluid. I thought maybe I just peed my pants! So I tell my husband and he starts freaking out. Like running all around, grabbing things throwing clothes on. I start to pull the sheets off of the bed and he starts getting mad at me! Of course I don't want to come home to wet stinky sheets! I then call my midwife and she tells me to start heading up to the center. Well as I'm walking out of the bedroom door, the rest of my water comes gushing out. Like a flood. So I go back into the bedroom to change and as I'm peeling my pants off the contractions hit me.  I finally get dressed again and make my way out to the car.  Thankfully my MIL lives three houses down from us so we didn't have to wake up or drop off our other son. At this point, it's now been maybe 15 minutes. \n\nWe have quite a drive ahead of us, and the first 20 miles weren't too bad.  The contractions were a little painful, but I was talking and singing in between them.  After we had gone about 40 miles, I didn't even want to breath. Well breathing in was fine, it was breathing out that hurt.  After that I don't really remember too much. It seemed like I was screaming the whole ride, but my husband said I was just mostly moaning and wimpering.  My husband told me afterwards that he was driving over 100 the whole way, cause he didn't want to deliver this baby on the side of the road!  So I could open my eyes, and watch the clock and I noticed that my contractions were about 2 minutes apart. So we finally get to the birthing center and I can't even walk up the ramp to go inside. I make it about 5 feet before having to stop. And then after that I wouldn't want to move! So my husband is basically pushing me inside and in to the room so I can get checked. I had told my husband beforehand that if I'm still at a 5 I would just cry.  Well, I was at an 8 and 100% effaced. Thank heavens! So while I'm on the bed, she is filling the tub and calling the other midwifes.  I don't really have a good time frame of how much time this took. I thought it was like 5 minutes, but everyone told me we were there for about 20 minutes and I had 10-12 contractions. Didn't feel like it.  After a few minutes (I thought) I told them I had to go pee. So they both helped me into the bathroom and as I'm sitting there the midwife looks at me and says that I have to stand up and get in the tub right now! Well, I didn't know that I was pushing. So I stand up and look down and I'm dripping blood. She said if you want to have a water birth get in the tub now, you are crowning. My husband asks if I want my swim top and I'm like nope just pull my shirt off. No inhibitions here thank you. I crawl in and once I'm in, I can't move. Of course I'm not facing the way that they want, but too damn bad. I'm not moving. So I start pushing and three pushes later, she tells me to pick up my son. It was amazing! I have never felt anything like that in my life. With my first son, I had an epidural before I even had pitocin, so I didn't feel anything.  This time I felt everything and it was the coolest experience of my life. The water was amaze-balls and it felt great from the moment I got in. So Wyatt and I laid there while we waited for the placenta to come out, and it was just surreal. I felt great. I didn't have a tear, which I thought was amazing considering he was 10lbs 3oz and 22 ½”!  It is so empowering knowing that I did it all without medicine!  And I was home by 11am and was walking and felt great. \n\nAnyways, that's my story. Thanks for reading. And here are this pics!\n\n[Wyatt 6 hours old](http://i.imgur.com/eQ6qhtK)\n\n[30 minutes old](http://i.imgur.com/DoO468D)\n\n[Big brother is so excited to hold him](http://i.imgur.com/QumIUAQ)",

DIM, Evening Primrose Oil, Magnesium L-Theanine) that won’t disrupt my body too much? just looking to find something that could ease symptoms/lower cortisol levels that i can integrate into my daily life without drastically changing my lifestyle. tired of wanting to try new things and explore other possible solutions online and every answer is GO FOR RUNS TWICE A DAY AND NEVER EVER EAT SUGAR OR BREAD. just not fucking realistic. i think my lifestyle is healthy as is…yeah i like a sweet treat yeah i like my ice coffee… i just hate that the things i enjoy could be cause for worsening my already freaked out body :( thnx for reading",

We had been trying for about a year, this was our 12th cycle.\n\nI was convinced that I was out for this cycle. Every other cycle was a total bust, so why would this be any different? We were going to be on vacation with my family during my fertile window and my acupuncturist recommended that I take a ovulation vacation where I don't take OPK's or obsess over getting pregnant. I didn't use preseed, but used Evening Primrose Oil and took my prenatals. \n\nBreakdown:\n\nBD: CD 9, 14, 16, 17, 19, 3DPO & 6 DPO.\nI ovulated on CD 19.\n\nMy breasts started feeling firm at around 8 DPO and I was cramping, but thought it was my imagination. No creamy CM or anything, which I usually get when AF is coming. I got a squinter BFP 10DPO and I couldn't believe it. I had gotten up to use the bathroom and decided to take a test and went back to bed. I was certain that it was an evap line, so I took another one and got the same result. I took the next day, at 11DPO, and it was a little darker, but still a squinter. I decided to go and buy a generic digital test from target and a clear blue. They both came back positive! That's when it finally hit us, we're going to be parents! \n\nMy symptoms after finding out are still pretty much the same. I still have cramping, but it's isolated to my uterus and my breasts are sore. I FEEL pregnant, like my uterus is full. I've never felt that before. \n\nIf I calculated it correctly, our due date is April 21st! I've already booked my 10 week appointment with a midwife. I really hope this baby sticks! :D\n\nPics and chart for those interested:\n\n[Wondfo Line Progression](http://i.imgur.com/ThMageU.jpg?1)\n\n[Digital Tests](http://i.imgur.com/izwofi2.jpg?1)\n\n[Chart](http://www.fertilityfriend.com/home/4be83b/?i=5756008&)\n\nBaby dust to all of you!! \n\n",

For the last two nights, on my midwives suggestion, I've been inserting a capsule of evening primrose oil vaginally, to help soften any scar tissue from the LEEP surgery I had. Last night, during insertion, I felt something like a large, hard, round lump through my vaginal wall, quite high up and just in front of, but above my cervix (which is quite closed, but soft.) We tried to conceive for about 2 years before this pregnancy, so I am no stranger to my cervix or vaginal walls, and this was absolutely new! \n\nMy first thought was that it was her head, based on location and size/shape/feel, so I did some research, and found that since Willow has been *very* low for a few weeks now, this hard round lump was indeed likely her head! \n\nI felt such an incredible mix of emotions!  The primary one though was confidence, and I couldn't figure out why until I was talking to my husband. He pointed out that if I can feel her head with my finger, that's not such a terribly long distance to push her out. He's right. *I can totally do this*. It's likely going to hurt, a lot. And it will be very hard work. I do get that, too. Things could go perfectly, or our carefully laid plans could go awry. Lots of things *could* happen. I recognize that. But right now, I feel so much more in touch with my baby and my body and feel more mentally prepared to do this than ever. This pregnancy has been a dream, and while I'm excited to meet her, she can stay in there as long as she needs to be ready. I'll just be out here, prepping our home to welcome her to the best of my ability, and knowing that when she is ready, I will be too. \n\nGood luck everyone! We are going to have our babies! ",

It is a large group and has women from all over the world in it. They are generally very supportive and nice, but it's definitely a different type of community than on reddit.\n\nLast week, a girl said she had stuck her finger up there and felt the babies head through her vaginal wall. Everyone *freaked.* They told her she shouldn't be sticking her fingers in her cervix and generally went nuts about how she was endangering her baby's life by inserting her fingers into her vagina. I couldn't believe it! The admin *banned* her and the current stickied post is about how anyone who does self cervical checks and posts about it will be automatically banned. I considered leaving the group over it because I felt so badly for how misunderstood the girl was and how absolutely ignorant everyone berating her seemed! Women are so scared of their vaginas - it's incredible.",

I had a terrible tear during my last delivery, and I'd love to be proactive about softening the scar tissue to avoid (more) painful stretching or repeat tearing..\n\nGood luck!

    "body": "Just wanted to make a quick post to share what helped me cure my post IUD hormonal acne. I started getting pimples all over my face around 1,5 year after getting a hormonal IUD. I never knew the reason so I cut out sugar, dairy, gluten avoided fluoride etc. I tried everything diet related, as I was sure this was the issue, but nothing consistently worked.\n\nEventually I finally decided to get the IUD out after having it for around 5 years. However this did not cure my acne, it just changed from constantly having pimples on my cheeks to getting it before my period around my lower cheeks and jawline. I tried many different supplements including zinc, DIM (made it worse for me, however I know it has helped others a lot) and nothing worked.\n\nFinally I tried Evening Primrose Oil (I take 1000mg once per day), and honestly overnight my acne started to fade. That was my miracle cure and I would say it cured 75% of my acne permanently (Or at least while I take it, I don't dare cheat on it haha). The remaining 25% went away after I started exercising and watching my sleep and stress levels. It sounds cliche, but exercising honestly impacts how my skin looks so so much.\n\nHope this can help someone and please remember this is just my personal experience. I started the Evening Primrose Oil because someone else posted about it, so I just wanted to return the favour :))\n\nI should mention, that I never had bad cystic acne but more like deep pimples that would eventually come to the surface and leave temporary dark spots but no scars luckily.",

    "body": "\nThis is very long, detailed and just full of everything that happened for me and I’m sorry for any errors, as I am on mobile and typed this out on my phone!\n\nAs many of you may have seen my posts I was absolutely terrified of a repeat csection as I have a 2 year old who is extremely clingy, and I’m very hard to numb due to scoliosis. I had been having prodromal labor daily since 37 weeks. My due date was October 27th, three days before my sons birthday. So I was careful to plan activities that kept me within distance of the hospital, but also encouraged myself to walk and be active to try to start labor. My doctors had discussed that due to the fact I was hard to numb, and had a bad experience with my first birth I needed to attempt to hold off on the epidural as long as possible. I had met with the anesthesiologists and they advised I plan for a spinal. So I couldn’t have an epidural and a spinal evidently. So they advised I labor as naturally as possible as they wanted to attempt a spinal before jumping straight to general anesthesia. So I prepped myself for a potentially scary and painful experience, but in all honesty I didn’t take any classes, or practice much besides breathing techniques. At 37 weeks I had a cervical check and I was not dilated at all but I was effaced. I got the go ahead to try to induce labor at home as I was desperate to go into labor naturally as my OBGYN practice will not induce someone who has had a prior C-section. So I was absolutely desperate to avoid a C-section, it was my constant thought and worry. I scoured reddit for successful posts and hope and prayed that she would come on her own. My doctor told me to try it all. I had been eating 70grams of dates daily since 36 weeks already...so I tried Evening Primrose Oil, Red Raspberry Leaf Tea, pineapple, spicy foods, nipple stimulation, pumping, sex, labor ball, and any exercises that might help her descend. At 38 weeks I was so very disappointed as I was still tightly closed but they stated she was low and they could feel the pressure and her head.. I continued to try to get her to come. I ordered the Bloomlife contraction monitor to watch contractions and be able to tell how close they were. Note: I think this is an awesome tool because it measured the start, length, intensity and end of the contractions and helped me see patterns. 39 weeks came and still no dilation, my doctor even tried to do a stretch and a sweep. She said she “tried as hard as she could and to expect bleeding.” However I was closed and it was unsuccessful. I watched and hoped to see my mucus plug, and checked the toilet every trip to the bathroom. I only had blood tinged mucus after a check which went away within the hour. At my 40 week appointment they advised that I was 70% effaced, and maybe half a fingertip dilated, but that was them being generous. I had begun to lose hope of a C-section. They planned to have me come back at 40 weeks and 5 days for a NST and we would plan that day for a C-section to be scheduled. My heart was so very sad, and I felt defeated by my body. I had tried everything, and was praying and pleading every night that I would go into labor naturally and have a vbac. I gave up on trying, and the day after my due date we went to a pumpkin patch for my son. Everyone asked me when I was due and I felt so discouraged telling them “yesterday.” Everyone then gave me their advice and tricks for going into labor. The guy who drove the tractor for the hay ride claimed his wife went into labor after a bumpy ride so he told everyone he was going to hit every hole possible to try to send me into labor. Of course this didn’t work, it did give me contractions and was really uncomfortable...I even walked as much as possible but again the contractions fizzled out shortly after getting in the car to go home. I finally stopped all the things I had been trying, and just pretty much resigned myself to the fact that I was a failure at this, and mourned the loss of my chance at a vaginal birth. I just decided to enjoy my last few days with my toddler before I was recovering from a C-section. \n\nI went to bed Thursday and decided to not eat or drink after 12 in the event they maybe would schedule the C-section for later on Friday. I woke up on Friday morning on the 1st at 3am to contractions. I thought this would be more prodromal labor as I had been having contractions off and on for over 3 weeks now. I told myself I could make it to my appointment at 9:30 for my NST and to schedule my csection. So I laid in bed cuddling my toddler until 7am timing them, when I felt that these contractions weren’t going away and were every 3-5 minutes and getting to be more and more painful. So I called my husband to wake him up so he could tend to our 2 year old, and told him I was going to head to L&amp;amp;amp;D. I knew I had a chance of being sent home, but I wanted to check because these were uncomfortable. I could talk but not really walk through them. I got dressed, grabbed my hospital bag, and hugged them both goodbye. I also cried while leaving because I left my toddler in bed and I heard him crying for me...and I didn’t know what the day held. Darn pregnancy hormones! I also don’t recommend driving yourself as this was very uncomfortable for me and made my contractions hurt worse. When I got to L&amp;amp;amp;D around 7:40AM I slowly shuffled my way inside as the contractions made it hard to walk. Once checked in they sent me back to triage and had me get dressed in the gown. They hooked me up to the monitors and wanted to watch me for 2 hours. I asked for the wireless monitor so that I could move around. Apparently this monitor is tricky and can be hard to get a good reading so heads up for anyone who may request this, but I didn’t want to be bed bound, so I pleaded to have wireless monitoring. They also started an iv for fluids and I absolutely hated this part. The placement was directly below my left thumb and rendered my hand completely useless honestly...not to mention it was so painful! The hospital doctor came in a little over the hour mark around 9AM, and checked me. She said I was a stretchy 1.5cm dilated and 80% effaced, which she said was progress since I had been closed tightly at all appointments. She told me we would check at the end of the 2 hours when a doctor from my OB came on.\n\nAt 10, around the 2 hour mark my OB came in, talked with me and he confirmed that my contractions were coming at a good pace and he would consider it early labor. I asked him what my best chance for a vbac was, and he said he felt breaking my water would speed things along but it also meant there was no going back. He also said if anything looks remotely wrong or if baby has any decels it’s a guaranteed C-section. They can’t risk anything. I agreed, and was ready to see what would happen. So they decided to admit me and sent me to a delivery room. Once inside he said he had to go do a C-section, but would come back within an hour and break my water. I was currently laboring alone because my husband was at home with my toddler who doesn’t do well away from me...so second best was daddy.Note:(The plan was for my mom and dad to stay with me until it was “go time” and then we would have them swap out with my husband, so he could be there for the birth) I called my parents and my mom came to sit with me and my dad shortly followed. I tried to walk around and encourage labor to progress. At 11am the doctor came back to break my water, and we discovered baby had already had a bowel movement. He wasn’t too concerned but said that they would have respiratory standing by in the room or in the ER depending on how everything goes. I explained that I hadn’t had anything to eat or drink as I knew a C-section was possible. He said that was a smart decision on my part and then made sure I was kept on a liquid diet.\n\nMy nurse was awesome, friendly and really encouraging. I expressed my fears and she talked to me explaining that whatever happens is fine. Don’t be discouraged and that I was awesome and powerful regardless of what kind of delivery I had. She also brought me a labor ball, applied counter pressure to my back and gave me essential oils. She wanted to help me labor naturally and was so encouraging. She brought me chicken broth that she had added some salt to, and jello which tasted awesome to me. I really loved her. \n\nI spent a lot of time walking around in my room and bouncing on the ball. I was able to walk a little in the hall but not much because the monitor had to stay in range. The ball made my contractions stronger and more painful and I couldn’t handle it for too long but I tried as long as I could possibly stand it. I had the nurse check me around 3pm and I had progressed to a 3, almost 4cm, and I lost my mucus plug and had bloody show. I was scared when she mentioned blood because I had been monitored for a chance of a potential placental abruption. But she reassured me that it wasn’t like my first labor, and that this was in fact a good sign. \n\nAround 6 pm my contractions were getting worse, and I was losing focus and ability to breathe through them. I asked for pain medicine in my IV. The nurse asked my doctor and then brought me dilaudid. It honestly didn’t do much for the pain besides take the edge off but it made me extremely loopy. Around 7pm my best friend came by to visit me, and I was nearly ripping my hair out to combat the pain of the contractions. I felt my eyelids getting droopy but when a contraction would hit I would pull hard on my hair desperate for a way to fight it. I had lost my concentration and ability to focus. I became desperate and told my friend and parents that I was going to ask for the epidural. My friend wished me the best and hugged me and left. My husband was trying to entertain our son and decided to bring him to see me. This was a breath of fresh air honestly. He sat on the bed with me, ate ice chips and cuddled which gave me a rush of emotions and helped distract from the pain. They stayed for about 30 minutes and he cried when he had to leave. My parents went to get a bite to eat, and my dad went home to let their dog out. Laboring alone was no fun, because I was scared I couldn’t handle the pain, but I did the best I could. Shortly after my mom came back to be there for me. Sadly at this time my nurse was getting off as it was shift change and she introduced my new nurse. My new nurse had 2 natural medicine free births, and one csection. She was able to talk with me and try things to help me but sadly I felt I was too far into the pain and asked her to please ask my doctor about the epidural. I believe this was around 8 or 9pm. My mind was racing because I knew what this meant. And I knew that if it went the same way my first birth did that this epidural would wear off quickly. I was also scared I would have to wait long and I was losing my ability to cope. I asked if I could also have more pain medicine because it made me sleepy. But she said that I couldn’t have the narcotic and consent to an epidural. I sighed and agreed and asked her to make the call. She called and the anesthesiologists was there within 15 mins. \n\nI really hated the anesthesiologist, he was very curt, and cold. While he was cleaning the area he was asking me questions. And during a very painful contraction I was struggling to talk and move like he wanted me to, and my mom answered a question for me. He snapped really nastily at her, “I get you are her mother but she needs to answer me. Not you.” He advised all the risks and I just agreed desperate to get it over with. My mom gave me a smile and went and sat on the couch watching me, and the nurse told me what to do. I already knew what I was supposed to do as I had an epidural with my first. I was terrified that this was all for nothing, and that it would wear off like my first did. The epidural wasn’t that painful, it was over quickly and I barely flinched. Once it was placed they laid me down. It took a little bit for the numbness to kick in. They decided to check me again around 10pm and I was able to move my right leg, which sent sheer terror into my body because I thought this meant it was failing. My left leg I had some movement but not much. I had progressed to 5cm but my contractions had slowed down a good bit. But I expected this might happen. So the doctor decided that they wanted to give me a very low dose of pitocin, which they started at a 2. Thankfully at this point I couldn’t feel my contractions so my nurse tried to reassure me that it would all be okay. \n\nMy nurse routinely would come in to in and out cath me. Which I didn’t enjoy but thankfully couldn’t feel.\n\nThis is where I honestly lost track of time. They advised I try to get some sleep. At this point my dad came back and both he and my mom slept a little. I texted my husband and desperately missed my son. I was so scared and anxious that I would wake up and the epidural would have worn off, I absolutely couldn’t sleep. I just laid there with my eyes closed or read on my phone. My doctor popped in and out to check on me and at one point did a check and confirmed that I was a 6. I was happy but still had the sinking feeling that I would feel pain so I couldn’t relax.\n\nAt one point the doctor came in and they wanted to put some catheter like object inside so it could show them the intensity of contractions. I have no idea what it was called but he had a very hard time placing it due to babies head putting so much pressure. Finally he placed it, and they bumped the pitocin to a 4 and he left. I asked my nurse what we could try and she offered the peanut ball. I agreed to try it. I have to say this little thing worked wonders. About 40 mins go by and I start to feel pain. But it’s more like painful pressure in my butt and vagina. At this point I’m telling myself that this is it. All my reddit stories prepared me for this. I’m fully dilated and she’s pushing down, I just know it.  My nurse comes in to see if I want more water and I explain that I feel pain, and it doesn’t “feel right.” But I also didn’t feel pushy. She seemed skeptical but she asked me if I wanted her to check me and I eagerly agreed. At this point my dad was in the chair next to me snoring away, so I asked me mom to “block” his view haha. The nurse gloves up and starts to check me. I knew by her face what she was going to say. She looks at me and said “Oh wow, you are fully dilated, and she’s starting to come. It’s time to push!” I knew in my heart that I was right. \n\nWe wake my dad up and tell him it’s time to switch out. My son was asleep in bed so my husband waited til my dad got to our house and then makes his way to the hospital. \n\nThe nurse instructs me that I need to push. But for some reason getting to this point really freaks me out and I start to panic. I start shaking terribly and feel nauseous. I tell her “I can’t do this.” Over and over, and I get scared as the pain and pressure comes and goes. My husband arrives and sits in the chair next to the bed. I ask for nausea medicine because at this point I am shaking and so psyched out I can’t handle anything. My doctor comes in and she advises him I’m having trouble and that I’m panicking. He tells me “This is what you wanted. That pain you feel will get better because it’s your body trying to push. You can do this!” I explain I feel sick so he tells her to give me medicine. I also ask him to remove the catheter to measure contractions as it was uncomfortable and bothering me. They remove it and he leaves saying he will come back when it’s “time.” She administers the medicine and I slowly feel better. She tells me what position to try to push in, and advises that she will hold one leg and my husband can hold another. But I ask my mom to do it instead. My husband is very squeamish, and decided to sit very far back, and I didn’t think he could handle the blood or the sights. So my mom stepped up and grabbed my right leg while my nurse held the other. Pushing was pretty hard, because she told me to curl up over myself while pulling my legs to my chest and pushing like I was having a big bowel movement. I couldn’t get a grip on my arm because of that damn IV, it made it where I couldn’t bend my hand or hold my leg. And I couldn’t get comfortable or focus with just the nurse holding it for me. She had me try pushing while holding and squeezing the peanut ball. She offered the squat bar but I refused. I couldn’t push effectively and she says she’s going to empty my bladder once more. So she caths me again, and tells me to try again: She then asked if I wanted the mirror. I accepted that and got positioned again on my back. \n\nI never thought I wanted to see but once she offered me the mirror and I could see what was happening I felt better. I trusted my body, and pushed when I felt the need. It was a little annoying because she would ask if I was contracting because the monitor wasn’t showing one. But I knew what I felt. I am able to see her head at this point as I push, and when I stop she slowly starts to slide back up, and this gives me more drive to push harder, longer and more effectively. My pushes get more effective. At one point I look over at my husband and he’s asleep on the couch snoring. My nurse jokes that everyone in my family sleeps easily except me, because everyone that was over tonight except my friend fell asleep. She calls the doctor back and the room fills with people laying out instruments and buzzing about. While pushing my doctor starts to place his fingers inside and stretch and move his hands around her head. This part felt really weird and looked even more strange to me. It was strange seeing his hands and feeling what he was doing. But I believe it helped a ton. I push as hard as I can at the nurses coaching and when I need to. One nurse unbuttons the top of my gown and pulls it down ready for skin to skin. On my second to last push I feel the pressure intensify and then it’s gone and I see her head is out, they instruct me to push hard again. I take a breath and push. I close my eyes and push hard with this one and I hear them say she’s out as I open my eyes I see her come out into my doctors hands. I felt an overwhelming sense of relief as she comes out. They immediately suction her out, and ask who is cutting the cord. I ask my husband and he shakes his head no very quickly so I ask my mom who had stepped away. She cuts the cord and shortly after they place her on my chest and start wiping her off. As soon as she was out my mom stepped back and turned away so I could see her first. This was nice and really respectful of her I thought. I looked down at my baby girl and felt so proud and relieved. I did it. I actually did it. My doctor pushes on my stomach twice and I feel the placenta come out. I ask if I can see it. He laughs and shows me while saying. “it looks a little stained from the meconium but it looks great and intact.” While I hold baby they start assessing me. Evidently I did tear but it was a smaller internal tear that did need stitches, and a few small lacerations he used silver nitrate on. He begins to stitch me up. This part didn’t exactly hurt but it felt weird because I felt the pulling as it went through while he did it. My little girl was born November 2nd at 4:58 am after a hour and a half of pushing. My doctor told me as far as VBACs go I had the most ideal one I could have hoped for given my situation. Which was great!\n\nThey gave me an hour of skin to skin with baby, during which she snuggled, latched and slept. My mom and husband got to sit with me and see her. My husband also got to hold her some also. He told me he was proud of me but surprised I didn’t scream or make any noises during pushing. I told him that’s because I was medicated and had the epidural. He then said that the movies had lied to him haha. \n\nThey weighed her after an hour or so and she was 6lbs 15oz. She was 21 inches long head to toe, and scored perfectly. \n\nI spent the day in the hospital by myself as my husband went home to take care of our son, and my parents caught up on sleep. I was so geared up and hyped up on adrenaline that I couldn’t sleep. Note: I ended up being awake for over 40 hours without sleep before I finally was calm and relaxed enough to rest at home. Lactation came by and met with me and explained that they were impressed with how much I knew and that I even knew she was lip tied. She said she wished more moms that planned to breastfeed were as educated on breastfeeding as I was. The food wasn’t too bad and I even find myself craving some the food I had while there. But I wasn’t impressed with the tea. It was gross! I did however love the graham crackers and have been obsessed with those since!\n\nI was discharged on the afternoon of the 3rd, right at the 24 hour mark...and able to go home to relax as she passed all her tests, received her vaccines and was eating well. She only lost 3% of her birth weight. My first night home I cleaned the house, and did laundry and held my little boy so tightly. I also had one meltdown with my post partum emotions because I was running on no sleep and my Mil tried to guilt trip me into letting her come over. When I wanted my first night home to be with JUST me and my little family as I needed to be with my son and try to get a sense of normalcy. Besides she had the chance to come see me in the hospital and she chose not to and decided to go out that night...So not my problem lady! \n\nI feel really grateful my mom was there as support. She said it was very special for her. I wasn’t sure how I would feel having her watch me push and looking in the mirror also, because that’s my mom seeing my lady bits in a way she will never be able to unsee or possibly forget haha. But it was a great bonding experience for us and something she likely wouldn’t have ever experienced. And she said she felt very special to be the one to cut the cord. \nMy husband wasn’t super helpful in terms of the delivery but he is very squeamish. He can’t handle blood or gore in a movie as it makes him sick. I knew he might not be able to handle it and respected that he needed to sit down away. He did so much for us by staying with the toddler and losing sleep to try to help him. He was needed at home with our son and I’m so grateful he was able to comfort our son. And it improved their relationship! I appreciate all everyone did to make this birth as easy as possible. \n\nI’m currently 15 days post partum, and feel pretty great. My recovery has been pretty good, aside from some urethral irritation due to being in and out cathed about 5 times. I am still sitting on my little donut pillow because it feels great. Little girl eats like a champ which means I eat like I can’t get full haha. Nursing makes me so hungry. Elena weighs 7lbs 9oz today! I am sleeping in about 3-4 hour intervals averaging about 6-7 hours a night. My little boy is slowly adjusting but still struggles with not having my undivided attention. He doesn’t really understand but he sometimes pats her back or head. I’ve been successfully baby wearing using my boba wrap to get things done. I have a friend who’s a baby wearing instructor and she brought the library she carries with her to my house, and showed me the carriers that will work and how to use them(so highly recommend going to a baby wearing meeting around you if you can!)I’ve been able to keep my house clean, play with my son, relax and cook. So far everything is going well, and I’m eternally grateful that I had the VBAC I was hoping for. The recovery is drastically different and it feels amazing to know both sides now. The only downside is I’m somewhat stir crazy and it’s cold outside...and it’s flu season so I’m trying to be careful about going out! \n\nIf you made it this far thank you! I felt it was always therapeutic and enjoyable to type about your birth(or any experience you want to share)even if it wasn’t traumatic or scary. I hope any mom who was where I was at, or feeling like I did has the birth they want!",

    "body": "So I'm super late but I want to share my birth story!!! It's going to be extremely long ❤️ because that's the kind I like to read. \n\nIt begins on 12/10 (39+5) when I started having random bouts of contractions. They would last anywhere from 30min to a couple of hours, then vanish. On 12/11 (39+6) I went to the grocery store and the mall to get some walking in (snowy/icy outside) then over to my mother's house where I told her I was going to go into labor that night. She was skeptical. \n\nThroughout my pregnancy I performed self-checks on my cervix because I was high risk of cervical incompetence. My midwife advised me to stop ✋ when I reached full term, but I did not, because things were finally getting interesting lol. On 12/10 I was a fingertip dialated and 0% effaced as I had been for weeks. On 12/11 I was suddenly 2-3cm dialated and increasingly effaced!!! Which is how I knew with certainty that I was going into labor. Right before bed on 12/11 I lost a gob of mucus plug with bloody streaks & decided to perform as much of a stretch and sweep as I was capable of. I couldn't do a sweep because I wasn't willing to put my whole hand in there but I was able to do the stretch part with 2 fingers. Then I inserted 3 capsules of evening primrose oil and went to bed. (Can you tell I was SO FREAKING READY? Lol)\n\nWhen my husband got home from work at 10PM I asked him to come straight to bed because I was going into labor. He stayed up until midnight 🙄😤 and woke me up coming to bed. As I was laying there trying to fall back asleep a contraction hit and I just knew it was going to be for real this time because it was more painful and made me shiver. By 12:30PM I was calling L&D explaining I had been in early labor for a few days and now felt the real deal was beginning. The midwife advised me to take a shower, so I did, a nice long hot one, and when I came back to bed my husband was asleep. The shower did nothing to ease the contractions and instead made them more extreme. \n\nI labored silently next to my hubby in bed until around 2:30AM when I woke him up. He was skeptical because with our first child I was screaming even in early labor, and this time with hypnobirthing techniques I was just breathing deeply through each contraction. He started to believe around the 5th contraction he was awake for, because I was getting a \"glazed\" look, dropping to all 4s, and unable to talk to him during them. Between contractions I was laughing and smiling, giddy with excitement. \n\nWe packed our hospital bag (baby's was ready to go) and I ate some Greek yogurt. My mother was on standby to come stay with our toddler while we went to the hospital. She arrived at 3:30AM. We got dressed (oops) then called an Uber at 3:50AM... the driver freaked out and offered to call an ambulance for us lol. My hubby said \"Sir I dont need an ambulance, I need an Uber\". It took me an eternity to get down our 4 flights of stairs. Got in the car at 4:00AM on the dot right after a contraction. We live less than a mile from the hospital and I was praying we would get there before another contraction hit. My prayers were answered and I contracted again the moment I got out of the car, at 4:03AM. Hah!\n\nWe went to triage, the same room I was put in when I went into labor with our daughter. I had forgotten to ever call L&D again so they were a bit frazzled and slow. I was absolutely miserable on my back/reclined in the bed while they did the NST. I stood up while waiting for the nurse (?) to come check my cervix. I was 5cm when checked around 4:45AM. At around 5:10AM another nurse came to show us to our delivery suite... the same room I delivered our daughter in 3.5 years ago!!! I immediately asked my hubby to begin filling the jacuzzi birthing tub. \n\nFrom around 6AM-9AM I was in the tub. Which is good, because I was uncontrollably peeing during many of the contractions 😳😬 At some point during that I felt my waters rupture and I tried to tell the nurse & later the midwife but I guess they didn't get the memo lol because when I eventually got out as I hit transition and had a contraction leaning over the edge of the bed, everyone was surprised to see my waters leaking. \n\nAt this point (transition) I was starting to bite a washcloth and moan through some of my contractions. It was becoming harder to stay in a good headspace, but I managed it. I asked for a cervical check but my midwife said no \"because you won't like what you hear\" 😂 I labored on the birthing ball for a little while and hated it. I ended up on the bed, on my knees, leaned forward onto a huge pile of pillows and the top of the bed. \n\nThe next few hours are kind of lost to me. I know my husband fork-fed me scrambled eggs and bacon sometime before 10AM. My husband and nurse took turns massaging my back. Around 11AM, my midwife requested to check my cervix and I consented. She found I was 9cm and my waters, though leaking, were bulging. She asked to break them more completely and I agreed. IDK if that was the right choice because soon thereafter she told me I was \"bleeding more than she likes to see\". \n\nAt 12PM I started pushing based on changing sensations and getting the urge to do so. Still kneeling. \n\nAt 2PM I was still pushing 😩 and starting to seriously panic. It was becoming a struggle to stay positive, I felt like a failure. My midwife had been having me try various positions -- on my sides, on the birthing stool, standing, all 4s, nothing was working. She asked to check my cervix again and found a small \"lip\" which she started trying to pull out of the way with each contraction. I asked for apple juice. The baby was in increasing distress and pooped fresh meconium into my previously clear waters, which worried all of us. \n\nEventually around 2:45PM she convinced me to try laboring on my back with my legs up. It hurt so badly to get into that position that I writhed around on the bed and dry sobbed. I was so pissed, I gave birth in this position last time due to an epidural and swore I would not do so again 😡 but within 2-3 contractions my midwife, nurse, husband and Mom all looked giddy with excitement and were telling me they could see the baby's hair!!! \n\nI pushed and pushed and nothing was happening. My midwife said I was pushing with the wrong part of the contraction and told me to wait. I was waiting. I was waiting until my body pushed all on its own but my midwife didn't believe me 🤷🏻‍♀️I was getting very angry with her as a result. \n\n3:10PM she told me I had been pushing too long & said I needed to choose between a vacuum assist or a c-section. This is **exactly** what happened with my first birth but after 5.5 hrs of pushing. I was so sad and angry and basically completely ignored the two options, did not discuss or consent to either. The next contraction I tried harder than I had been before and could feel that I was gonna tear. I told the midwife I was going to tear and she said \"no you're not\". Lies!!! \n\nWith absolute terror of tearing, but extreme fear for my son, I pushed as hard as I possibly could and did my best to pretend I couldn't feel my precious nether regions being torn to shreds. Baby's head was born SCREAMING 😱😱😱 and he was \"sunny side up\", so facing me!!! My midwife told the nurse \"I need backup, baby is screaming with chest still inside\". I've read a LOT of birth stories and watched many birth videos and had never heard of this happening. I was terrified he was going to breathe in meconium and end up in the NICU like an acquaintance's baby did last March. So with every member of my support team telling me not to, I pushed without a contraction and got my son out! I was able to reach down and pull him up to my chest myself. We didn't know the gender... I used my hand to check and happily told my husband we had a son! \n\nThe placenta came within 10 minutes with no intervention necessary. Hubby cut the cord after it stopped pulsing. Little guy did NOT latch right away like my daughter did, had absolutely no interest in doing so. We were covered in meconium and I can honestly say my son was not born the least bit cute, his forehead conehead from being stuck for so long was way weirder than my daughter's back-of-the-head conehead was. \n\nI got a second degree tear down into my perineum. When I asked my midwife how many stitches were going in, she said \"we don't count the stitches as we sew a hem\" 😱 It took her a while. I'm 12 days out and STILL haven't taken a close look at what's going on down there, but I stopped taking pain meds at day 6 and am feeling good. \n\nOur 3.5yro toddler was there for the whole experience and tried to kiss the baby's toes before the meconium was even wiped off. She was a champ & I'm glad she was there. She served as a reminder of what I was working so hard for, and also her presence & not wanting to scare her helped me control my volume and language. Haha.\n\nLinus Winters Sage Keeling was born on his due date 12/12/17 at 3:25PM, weighing 6lbs 15oz and 19.5\" long. My second due date baby -- 1 in 40,000 odds of that!",

    "body": "Hey everyone! I've been on a deep dive into understanding the immune system, particularly in relation to psoriasis. Consolidating information like this really helps me grasp it better. While there's a wealth of knowledge out there, I've highlighted both natural and conventional methods that I've personally tried and those frequently mentioned in this sub. I thought it might be helpful to share this consolidated overview with the community. I've noticed we often discuss treatments in isolation, so seeing them side-by-side might offer a fresh perspective. I'm even considering creating a collaborative Google Doc, sort of a community mind map, inspired by the app StuffThatWorks. What do you think?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Understanding the Immune System & Psoriasis**\n\n**Immune System Basics:**\n\n* **T-cells**: Recognize and kill infected cells. They also play a role in the production of cytokines like IL-17 and IL-23, which are involved in the inflammatory response of psoriasis.\n* **B-cells**: Produce antibodies. These are essential for fighting off pathogens but can also be involved in autoimmune reactions in certain conditions.\n* **NF-κB**: A protein \"switch\" inside cells that, when activated, can turn on genes leading to inflammation. It's especially important in producing pro-inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory agents. \n* **Macrophages**: Engulf pathogens. They release cytokines, including TNF-α, that can contribute to inflammation.\n* **Neutrophils**: First responders to infections. They can release substances that amplify inflammation in certain conditions.\n* **Cytokines**: Messenger proteins that regulate immune responses.\n   * **Pro-inflammatory**: Promote inflammation. Examples include TNF-α (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha), IL-6, IL-23, and IL-17A.\n   * **Anti-inflammatory**: Work to counteract inflammation. Examples include IL-10.\n* **Receptors**: These are proteins on the surface of cells that cytokines bind to, initiating a cellular response. Examples include TNFR (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor, which binds to TNF-α), IL-17RA (for IL-17A).\n* **Inflammation**:\n   * **Acute**: Short-term response to injury or infection, generally protective.\n   * **Chronic**: Long-term, persistent inflammation, which can be harmful and is seen in conditions like psoriasis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Natural Immune Modulators**:\n\n  \n\n* **Probiotics**: They influence the gut's immune system, which can have systemic effects. Some strains can increase anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10 and reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α.\n* **Vitamin D**: Vitamin D can suppress the proliferation of T-cells and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-17 and IL-23.\n* **Berberine**: It inhibits the activation of a protein complex called NF-κB. When NF-κB is activated, it can lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by various immune cells, including T-c,izing of the gut lining, which can influence systemic inflammation.\n* **Turkey Tail**: The polysaccharides in Turkey Tail can stimulate macrophages and other immune cells, enhancing the body's overall immune response without specifically targeting the pro-inflammatory pathways of psoriasis.\n* **St. John's Wort**: Hyperforin inhibits NF-κB, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine production.\n* **Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: They can be converted into anti-inflammatory molecules in the body, which can reduce the activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-6.\n* **Curcumin (from Turmeric)**: Inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-6.\n* **Green Tea Extract**: Contains polyphenols that suppress the activation of immune cells, such as T-cells.\n* **Evening Primrose Oil**: Provides gamma-linolenic acid to modulate inflammatory responses.\n* **Black Cumin Seed Oil**: Contains thymoquinone, which inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.\n* **Apple Cider Vinegar**: Used topically to balance the skin's pH and reduce itching associated with psoriasis.\n* **Oregano Oil**: Contains carvacrol with anti-inflammatory properties.\n* **Bitter Melon Extract**: Modulates inflammatory responses.\n* **Licorice Root**: Contains glycyrrhizin, which inhibits pathways leading to skin inflammation.\n* **Fish Oil (Rich in Omega-3s)**: Interferes with inflammatory cell signaling pathways.\n* **Milk Thistle**: Contains silymarin, which inhibits inflammatory pathways in the skin.\n\n**Pharmaceuticals:**\n\n* **Methotrexate**: Affects rapidly dividing cells, including activated T-cells, by interfering with folic acid metabolism.\n* **Topical Corticosteroids**: Interact with steroid receptors in cells, inhibiting genes responsible for inflammation.\n   * **Enstilar**: A combination of calcipotriene (a Vitamin D analog) and betamethasone (a corticosteroid); reduces skin inflammation and suppresses cell turnover.\n   * **Dovobet/Taclonex**: Combination of calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate; modulates skin cell production and reduces inflammation by suppressing inflammatory substances.\n   * **Salicylic Acid**: A keratolytic agent; helps in the shedding of dead skin cells, reducing scaling and preventing clogged pores.\n* **Biologics**: Target specific immune cells or proteins to disrupt the inflammatory cascade. For instance, Taltz and Cosentyx target interleukins involved in the inflammatory process.\n   * **Cyclosporine**: Immunosuppressant that inhibits T-cell activation.\n   * **Skyrizi (Risankizumab)**: Targets IL-23, a cytokine involved in the inflammatory process of psoriasis.\n   * **Humira (Adalimumab)**: A biologic that targets TNF-α, a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.",

    "body": "Hey all, \n\n\n\n  So since i turned 13 years old i've been fighting acne, but it wasn't until the unfortunate age of 17 that my occasional breakout turned into full blown cycstic acne MONSTERS on my face that would torment me for weeks on end, or sometimes months. It was pretty bad, to say the least. Last year (age 25), after trying practically every single acne solution on the planet, including the best/most expensive prescriptions my dermatologist could muster, I decided to stop treating the symptoms, but actually start treating the cause.\n\n\n  After a whole lot of research, I made my own regimen that has been working MIRACLES for me for the past year. My skin is clear, it is happy, it is no longer uncontrollably greasy. I will say though, that to see results took about 4 weeks, but if you decide to do this, keep with it, be diligent about it, and I believe you'll see the same results i did.\n\n\nHere is my routine:\n\nI wash my face in the morning and at night. Easy right? It is. But don't bother with any of that fancy junk... here is the real Holy Grail:\n\n\n   **Step ONE: Jojoba Oil (100% organic & cold pressed!):**\n\nYep. Oil removes oil, you guys. Take 3 (yes, just 3) drops after wetting your face with warm water and massage it into your face for a full minute. Relax, breathe, enjoy. If you're wearing makeup, after massaging for a minute, take a cotton pad, wet it, and use it to remove your makeup, add a little more oil if necessary, but please USE SPARINGLY. \n\n\n   **Step TWO: Dr Bronner's Liquid Soap:** \n\nI use the tea tree kind because i love the smell, but if you have more sensitive skin, go for the one for sensitive skin, it works just as well. Use enough soap to lather in your hands. Massage on your face for 30 seconds. Rinse. Then wash your face again with the soap for another 30 seconds. \n\n\n   **Step THREE:** \n\nDry your face! Yay! Please use a clean towel.\n\n\n   **Step FOUR: Dickinson's Witch Hazel Toner.** \n\nThis stuff is CHEAP and works wonders. I can't even say enough good things about it. It doesn't smell great, but it really delivers. Use a cotton pad to spread it evenly on your face. Let dry.\n\n\n   **Step FIVE: Jojoba Oil again.**\n\nNo need for moisturizer (unless your skin is begging for it, in which case, i highly recommend Lush's Vanishing Cream. Use VERY LITTLE of it. It is incredible.) just use the oil. Take two small drops and rub it all over your face. Massage gently. You are moisturizing, not removing oil. Don't forget under your eyes! If you use too much, no problem, just wipe it off a bit with a clean towel!\n\n\nOkay, do this in the morning and at night. It takes about 10 minutes total. \n\n\nNow onto my vitamin regimen... \n\n\n   **Pantothenic Acid (B5) by TWINLAB:** \n\nThis helps reduce your skin's sebum production while simultaneously reducing pore size and clearing up existing acne. I started at 10 500mg pills daily... 5 in the morning and 5 at night, for about 2 months, then i brought it down to my current dosage of 3 in the morning and 3 at night. \n\n\n   **Cod Liver Oil Pills by Carlson:**\n\nThis is an all-over-health vitamin. It does everything. Clears your skin, it is an anti-inflammatory (so it helps get rid of those red angry bumps all over your face) boosts your immunity, lowers your blood pressure, fights PMS, fights depression...everything. And everything it does, it does it WELL.\nI take one 1000mg pill in the morning and one at night. It's important to space out your vitamin dosages because your body will be better able to absorb the nutrients. Yes, you might experience fish burps, but it is a SMALL price to pay for the gorgeous skin you're in for.\n\n\n   **Zinc:**\n\nThis is a little known acne fighter. Many people don't get enough zinc in their diet and the effect of that tends to show up on your skin in the form of cystic acne. I take one 50mg pill in the morning and one at night.\n\n\n   **Folic Acid by TWINLAB:** \n\nIt is most famously known as a prenatal vitamin that is also excellent for hair and nails. Not many people know that it also makes your skin glow healthy and have a youthful appearance. This stuff is fantastic. I take one 800mcg tablet in the morning and one at night.\n\n\n   **Evening Primrose Oil:** \n\nThis is another one of those cure-all vitamins that not enough people use. It has a fair number of benefits, including anti-inflammatory properties, skin-health benefits (especially for those who suffer from eczema), and also aids in fighting menstrual pain. I take 500-1300mg (depending on the bottle i buy) in the morning and the same amount at night.\n\n\nIf you are diligent about this...wash your face in the morning, at night, and take your vitamins in the morning and at night, even after you start seeing results, i can almost guarantee you that you will finally have the skin you have always wanted. I definitely do. \n\n\nFeel free to ask any more questions if you have them!! I want to help everyone be as happy with their skin as i am! \n\n(edit: formatting)\n\n(edit 2: if you're nervous about using oil on your already suffering skin, please have a look at [acne.org's jojoba oil information](http://www.acne.org/jojoba-oil.html) )",

Dr Bronners is very stripping, and jojoba can be extremely comedogenic. \n\nAlso, please don't advise people to take supplements. Supplements are easily available, but they can interact with some medications in a very bad way. No one should supplement their diet without first researching their health conditions and medications that may interact with the supplements (at the very least) or asking their doctor.\n\nJust please be wary of this kind of thing when posting. We try to give people safe advice and always take precautions about diet changes and supplementing, since it can be a potentially dangerous thing for some people.\n\nEdit: I see you mentioned this above. Thank you -- I just get concerned because I know what lengths people will go to try to clear acne. We don't want someone self medicating on high doses of a supplement and then winding up in a hospital. Skin is important, but there's more to the body than just the skin and we want everyone here to be healthy and happy.",

    "body": "I have short wavy to curly hair that generally gets very frizzy. It is dry, with normal scalp. I have a lot (A LOT) of really thick hair. It is high porosity and takes hours to dry, even when chin lenght as it is now. The texture is very mixed, with some slightly wavy strands all the way up to kinky curly ones. I'd say most of it falls in category 2B.\n\n\nI have been wearing my hair curly and was getting fantastic results with a product by Rene Furterer, the Veloute Perfecteur de Boucles. It was a light, non greasy cream and I could use a fair amount of it without any adverse effects. Something in it really helps with curl formation, and all I had to do was put it into still rather wet hair, and let it dry. Perfect, consistent results every time. The hair was curly, light, perfectly hydrated.\n\n\nHere is the ingredient list:\n\n\n*Water, ethyhexyl palmitate, cetearyl alcohol, acanthus mollis leaf extract, amodimethicone, BHT, butylparaben, cetearyl glucoside, cetrimonium chloride, disodium EDTA, ethylparaben, fragrance (parfum), inulin lauryl carbamate, isobutylparaben, maltodextrin, methylparaben, persea gratissima (avocado) oil (persea gratissima oil), phenoxyethanol, polyquaternium-37, polyquaternium-68, propylparaben, trideceth-12.*\n\n\nA few months ago, they changed the line. Now the cream feels sticky and heavy, and although it still does promote curl formation (could be the acanthe extract, that is what the brand claims in their marketing), it makes my hair greasy and stringy and really just not nice. So, cue in another product hunt. Lots of money already into it, I'm not getting there... I now need a leave in, a defining curl cream and a gel to get lesser results, and I have to be so careful not to touch my hair under penalty of turning into a frizz ball.\n\n\nHere are the ingredients of the new, totally not improved product:\n\n\n*Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behenamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Acanthus Mollis Leaf Extract, Alpha Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, BHT, Butylphenyl, Methylpropional, Ceteareth-33, Citronellol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance (Parfum), Glycerin, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Hexyl Cinnamal, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Lactic Acid, Limonene, Linalool, Maltodextrin, Oenothera Biennis, (Evening Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Phenoxyethanol, Polyquaternium-68, Salicylic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Tocopherol, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Dissucinate.*\n\n\n**Is there anyone who is knowledgeable enough to take a look at the differences between old and new and maybe shed some light on how I can find another perfect product? My wallet and I thank you in advance.**",
