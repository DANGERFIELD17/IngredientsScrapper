After that she started to cut all the dead ends, but she was twirling my hair with her comb while she did it. Afterwards she diffused my hair to dry it and then finished it off with some hair oil (applied with praying hands) \n\nI have never in my life gotten my curls to do this before, my entire method is just to apply conditioner to my hair (Hask Biotin Boost) with a wet brush and scrunching and then let it sit for a few minutes and then rinse it out with cold water. I usually let my hair air dry when I wash it myself. \n\nThe last picture is what my sister responded with when I showed her the haircut\n\n",

    "body": "LET ME JUST SAY WOW\n\nI knew I was going to get responses but I was not expecting so many people to tell me it looks like I’m going through chemotherapy 😭🤣\n\nOk so I responded to some comments but there is just too many so the update is that I went back into the salon on Thursday and requested the owner but she wasn’t there so I reported everything to another stylist and showed her the pics and my hair and she was just in shock. I sent the pics to her and the owner called me yesterday morning and she was literally speechless. She has curly also and she just kept saying “I can’t believe this/ I am so sorry/ I am so embarrassed.” Shockingly though she did tell me that she has gotten a couple of other complaints on this stylist recently (obviously not to this extent) and she was like “if she wasn’t on the road going on vacation right now I would be calling her.” So I am getting my money back and the owner herself is going to fix what she can next Friday. She mentioned a blunt cut and a bob like many of you said and she was honestly upset that I couldn’t come in sooner but it just didn’t work out that way with our schedules. \n\nI am definitely still emotional about it and truly feel like a monster when my hair is down at home but I’ll be ok. My wonderful husband actually shaved his head in solidarity and he has beautiful curls too so that made me feel a little better 🤣 for everyone wanting me to call out the salon, I get it, but I just can’t do that. I live in a small town and work directly with the community and this is a salon that does booth rental so I truly don’t want to ruin an entire business over an incredibly incompetent person that is not a reflection of the entire establishment. I think the stylist will get enough issues just from speaking with owner and the fact that we do live in a small town and I have no issue telling people what happened to my hair when they ask. I won’t lie or sugar coat it 🩷🥰\n\nSo I’m getting the back evened out on Friday and you can see from the second picture that she actually framed my face very well so there’s that. As I said before my hair grows pretty fast so it’s about time, biotin gummy’s, and rice water spray for the next couple of months lol \n\nIf I remember to, I’ll post an update every few weeks just to show growth and progress and please let me know if you have any tips on hair growth! Here’s to a short hair summer!!! I also included a more recent picture of my hair down. When I was making the most I was still pretty upset so I literally just scrolled through my camera roll looking for one with my hair down but my hair truly has not changed much over the years.\n\nRoutine (now): wash every 2-3 days, rice water, gel, hairspray, diffuse upside down, and clip up the back 🤣",

The first few months i just tried to remain positive, saw a bit of regrowth but had really bad patches and had to wear a cap to work and when i was out and about. Around December i started noticing the patches had regrowth and then end of January i could get a haircut and actually style my hair and go to work. \n\nSince then it’s just been getting better and better. My hair is thickening out, my crown has basically fully recovered, my temples have hair filling in and the gap in the front is gone. \n\nI’ve literally got hair i had in my early 30’s - i’m 40 atm. \n\nApart from minoxidil and finasteride i eat healthy - no sugar, take biotin daily, quercetin, rosehip, coq10/pqq and acetyl l carnitine. \n\nMy gf who i’ve been with 8 years said my hairs thicker and better than when she first met me. \n\nI also use a derma stamp weekly at 1.5mm and apply minoxidil immediately after. I think the derma stamping has really been effective - particularly on my crown and temples. \n\nAll in all best decision i ever made. ",

    "body": "Ten months. Continuous bleeding. Every single day. Some days are lighter, which are like a little respite, because most days are heavy and awful. I got a referral for an endocrinologist back in JULY and still don’t have an appointment. I have PCOS, but usually it just means my periods are few and far between. \nHow am I supposed to function like this? I have all the period side effects that people take days off work and school for... everyday. I’m so tired. I feel like I’m cursed. \n\n\nETA: I just spoke with my mom. Turns out a football sized fibroid was the reason for her hysterectomy a few years ago so….. ruh Roh raggy (they kept one ovary in so she didn’t go through menopause) \n\n\nETA#2: I’m not on birth control, I take iron supplements, magnesium, vitamin d, fiber, biotin, and daily gummies. I made an appointment with a OGBYN for Jan 4th, I can’t afford the emergency room. Also, I don’t want kids lol \n\n\nThank you for listening to my rant.\n\n\n(I am nonbinary and use they/them pronouns)",

I finally feel like my age.\nHere's my routine:\n-Every morning I apply topical min. And take biotin pill. \n-Every night I apply topical min + fin solution after shower when hair has dried.\n-Once a week I dermastamp at 1.5mm. I do this at night after washing the scalp well. While showering I have needles soak in alcohol. Then I apply min+fin solution immediately after stamping. \n-I use keto shampoo 2-3 times a week. I scrub shampoo well into scalp and let sit for about 5 min then wash out.\n-A new thing I recently started using is a coloring shampoo to help hide some of the gray hair. I use this once a week.\n\nA little about myself:\nI'm 35 years old. I'm active. I go to the gym and have a job where I'm constantly on my feet (tower climber). I don't necessarily eat the healthiest. I'm 5 years sober from alcohol (was a heavy alcoholic) and quit smoking cigarettes around that same time as well. I noticed I was losing hair in my early 20s. I went to a doctor about it at the time and was told there was nothing I could do. I started shaving my head around 30 and hated it. I came across this sub then it got me to do some researching. I jumped on the meds 1 year ago and couldn't be happier! Have any questions feel free to ask.\n",

I don't think 1.5mm is necessary to get microneedling results, research actually seems to suggest puncturing 0.5mm deep gives much better results than 1.5mm. More is not necessarily better here! So I think your gains are probably more from min+fin.\n\nSide note: 0.5mm puncture depth does not necessarily correspond to 0.5mm needle size, depending on the tool you use, but 1.5mm will result in more puncture depth than that for sure. For derma stamp you achieve 0.5mm puncture depth by setting needle length to about 0.75mm. This [video](https://youtu.be/LxHNpkIKW0E?si=vxI-51aqzR0T3P5v) talks about it in detail.",

    "body": "I've been on this sub for an entire year, and eating keto for 15 months; this being my first New Year as an experienced ketoer, I feel (probably wrongly) inclined to offer the small bits of wisdom I've accumulated with the help of this sub...at 2:00 in the morning, so it's guaranteed to be buried in other posts within a few hours (but I don't care because I had fun typing it all out). These are all the things I either wished someone had told me about when I started, or things people here *did* tell me that changed the way I looked at/did things because I didn't pay enough attention to the FAQ. Most of this stuff is in the FAQ, some of it isn't. They're in no particular order.\n\n\n1. *Electrolytes are REALLY important*, even if you think they aren't. You need like 5000mg sodium, bro (among others).  Powerade Zero won't do a damn thing unless you pour Lite Salt in it, which you should. \n\n\n2. *Take measurements.* I never did and I wish I had. Take before pictures too! I *did* take those and they really helped for those days I felt like I wasn't making any real progress. I was.  You might not lose weight at some points in your keto journey, but you're probably losing inches!\n\n\n3. *A \"stall\" is 5-6 weeks with no weight loss.* There were a few times I went 3-4 weeks without seeing the scale move, and then boom... I'd wake up one morning 4lbs lighter. Don't freak out if the scale stops moving if it hasn't been 5-6 weeks yet. \n\n\n4. *Recalculate your macros OFTEN.* I did it every ten pounds. You should not be eating the same calories weighing 150 that you ate at 200. Makes sense, right? Took me a bit to figure this one out, though! \n\n\n5. *Hormones go a little nuts.* For me as a woman, anyway. Ladies, I had a 54-day period when I started keto. STRAIGHT DAYS. I pushed through it and it eventually leveled out! My cycle is better now than it's ever been in my life, actually. r/xxketo helped me through that HORRIBLE ordeal! Check them out, those women kick serious ass. \n\n\n6. *Hair loss happens to some, not all.* My hair didn't start thinning until I was 7 months in and I'd lost 65lbs. It's not keto that causes it, though... it's weight loss in general. After upping my protein and taking collagen and biotin supplements (which I can't confirm for sure were effective, that's just what I tried), I'm starting to see new growth coming back in 8 months after the thinning started.  Still though, losing all the weight was WELL worth it.\n\n\n7. *Don't waste your money on urine strips.* Unless you're a type 1 diabetic, of course. Already bought some? Find a type 1 diabetic and regift them! That's not weird, right? \n\n\n8. Contrary to popular belief, *you don't have to do intermittent fasting with keto.* If you can eat for 12 straight hours and stay within your macros, then awesome! I accidentally started IF because I wasn't hungry in the mornings anymore and I've since progressed to OMAD...but if you don't want to, you don't have to. I love it, others don't. You do you. \n\n\n9. *I eat the same thing every. Single. Day.* I've seen people asking if this is bad. It's not. It's fucking awesome, simple, and I love it. \n\n\n10. *Protein is a goal, fat is a limit.* I was pouring coconut oil into my coffee and gagging on it because I thought I had to hit my fat macro the first week I did keto. Don't force feed yourself fat because of that number! In fact, if you're doing this for weight loss, you may want to rethink things like fat bombs after the first few weeks. \n\n\n11. *Buying new clothes is expensive* and incredibly rewarding. Mostly expensive, though. Don't pay a lot for your in-between-sizes wardrobe. Check out Goodwill or Target's hardcore clearance rack, and don't get attached to anything you buy at this point!\n\n\n12. *People are going to say stupid things to you* when they notice your weight loss. Sure, some will be genuinely happy for you and they'll tell you so, but others will do the backhanded compliment, like \"you're looking SO MUCH BETTER at this weight.\"  I had a coworker pull me to the side to ask me if I was terminally ill. Be prepared to deal with this really weird series of reactions to your hard work: I certainly wasn't!\n\n\n13. *There is always a reason to cheat,* as the legendary u/DClawDude says, and he's right. People at work at home, at social outings, will ALL push food on you. They'll look at you weird for not taking a breadstick at Olive Garden or for drinking water instead of craft beer like you used to. Don't let peer pressure be the reason you keep those pounds on. Those people don't have to live with your weight, *you do.* The longer you stick with this way of eating, the easier it gets to tell people no when they pass you a piece of cake. \n\n\n14. *This sub is the reason I was successful.* I know in the end, it was *my* decision to stick with it, work hard to stay within my macros, not cheat a single time, blah blah blah. But really, without the daily (hourly, even!) support of this sub, I really wouldn't have reached my goal so quickly and efficiently. I created this Reddit account, my first and only one, specifically for r/keto, and I am so very happy I did. They are helpful, knowledgeable, wise, and eager to fix your issues (as long as you read the FAQ first...\"did you turn it on and off again?*) if you give them a chance. Listen to them, whether they're gentle and way too nice or harsh and straightforward: they mean well and they can help you succeed if you allow them to. \n\n\ntl;dr - u/ReverseLazarus started typing some tips for a newbie that PMed her a question and decided to elaborate on all of them and post them to r/keto. Then she realized there were 14 of them, squealed with joy (on the inside, of course) and decided to give this long-ass post a history-nerd title that really exposes the kind of person she is. \n\nEdit: I'm sorry if this formatting sucks, I'm on mobile and have no idea what I'm doing.

That means I don't have to continually adjust and can just focus on eating the same macros for a longer period of time.

    "body": "Background: I have extremely dry, sensitive, acne prone skin. I've struggled with breakouts since I was a pre-teen. Took Accutane when I was in high school and my skin cleared up for a while. I'm now in my mid-20s and have been dealing with moderate acne for the past five years, mostly around my mouth and jawline. I assumed it was hormonal and have had several dermatologists confirm this suspicion.\n\nGuys, I have tried everything. EVERY. THING. To treat my acne and balance my hormones. I won't even go through the list. I've been lurking this sub since 2014 and have tried it all. I started using Curology in 2017 and it helped a lot, but I still had cystic acne that worsened around the time I got my period each month. I assumed that healing my acne was a lost cause, and that I would just have to wait until my hormones changed with age for it to go away.\n\nUNTIL FINALLY, I requested a consultation with my Curology derm at the beginning of quarantine. I figured now might be a good time to up my Tretinoin dose since I would be inside and wouldn't be wearing makeup for the foreseeable future.\n\nShe made a couple of suggestions, but the one that stood out was to switch the multivitamin I'm taking. It contained biotin, which many of us know to be good for our hair, skin, and nails, right? Not in my case. According to my doctor, there has been some evidence that biotin can cause breakouts in some people. From the research I've done, most studies seem to be pretty inconclusive, but some evidence suggests that ingesting biotin can throw your vitamin B5 levels out of whack, which can lead to breakouts.\n\nI switched to a new multivitamin which contains almost all of the same nutrients and minerals, minus biotin, and all of my cystic acne cleared up in less than a week and hasn't come back. I am in shock! I had 2-3 cysts on my chin for the past year, have not switched my routine at all other than the vitamins, and they've completely vanished. It's been about two months. I hope this progress continues! Still dealing with some PIE/PIH and residual scarring, but I find that much easier to deal with than cystic breakouts!\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nAM \\~\n\n1. Wash face with water and pat dry\n2. Timeless Vitamin C serum\n3. Neutrogena Hydro Boost for Extra Dry Skin (my holy grail due to price and effectiveness)\n4. Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sunscreen SPF 50+\n\nPM \\~\n\n1. Remove makeup with Garnier micellar water for sensitive skin (pink bottle)\n2. Wash face with CeraVe and pat dry\n3. Continue to let face dry for 30 minutes to an hour\n4. Apply Curology (9% Azelaic Acid, 1% Zinc, .009% Tretinoin)\n\nAnd then once a week or so I use Drunk Elephant's Babyfacial mask and follow up with the Neutrogena Hydro Boost and then DE's Marula Oil. I got the tiny version of Babyfacial and Marula Oil during a sale, so I paid like $20 for the set. It's amazing, y'all. Really hoping they make that set again in the future because $80 for a skincare product makes me want to scream ;)\n\nEdit: got my Curology percentages wrong",

Shortly after taking it, I noticed I was breaking out more than usual. But I thought, surely a vitamin isn't going to do that to me, right??? I kept going for a bit longer and sure enough the breakouts continued, so I finally listened to my gut and cut out the multivitamin. I switched to just taking vitamin c and vitamin d on their own for now. Breakouts have chilled out A LOT. After reading this, I checked the label of the old multivitamin because I still have the half-filled jar in my cabinet, and sure enough - Biotin! I mean, *maybe* it was a coincidence for me, but after reading you're post I am now pretty certain my gut feeling was correct and the vitamins were breaking me out!!",

Troponin is released into the blood as a result of myocardial damage (i.e., it tells the health care workers if you're having a heart attack). Biotin supplements can cause falsely low troponin readings, which may mean that your heart attack is not recognised (and therefore treated) as promptly. Biotin is known to interfere with some other more routine blood tests too.\n\n I'm a big advocate for eating a good diet, and that supplements are unwarranted in the absence of a diagnosed deficiency.

    "body": "Hi guys! \n*For title it should be Lasers/Skincare/Beauty Hacks\n*I have tan skin so lasers are a bit complicated due to risk of hyperpigmentation I.e. IPL not mentioned\n\nDISCLAIMER: PLEASE double check this with the science, before/afters, own skin and goals, and research articles. I'm not a dermatologist but a majority of my friend circle are physicians and we all do this anyhow before trying anything. I don't have time to cite articles etc and this is just MY experience SO I thought after spending so much money and buying all the overhyped products I should share what worked for me to reduce my skincare regimen and allow me to be makeup free for work. \n\nSo I've been deep into skincare for a long time and I wanted to officially share it as a lot of my friends asked me to. We don't gatekeep here and I thought Reddit would be the best place. My background: I'm into digital portraits and it requires an understanding of good ratios of the face. I'm also into deep diving into skincare hacks like all of us. Here's what I think works off the top of my head.\n\nProcedures\nUltraclear + Coring: forget ponytail facelifts, lip lifts, belphs, skinpinch, brow lifts, etc until you try this first. A good tech can get you the results you want. Ask to core where you want max lift. Make sure they pass with all the levels. It's painful so use your own numbing cream (I think some Russian brands are stronger available online), numb for a long time, and opt for the laughing gas or whatever. Make sure to have them use eye shields for your eyes. Have them core in the direction of the lift you want. Ask for a map of how they did it. \nYou'll want 2-3 over a year to get the full lift you want. Nothing supersedes this procedure. For healing: 10% vinegar soaks + ointment + Benev exosomes + Alastin skin nectar. Hydroquinone to prevent spots from forming. \n\nMoxi Level 3: It works REALLY well but it's a baby compared to Ultraclear. Make sure to try level 3 for maximum lift. You can do a series of 3 if you're not ready for Ultraclear. \n\nFontana 4D: It also works REALLY well and can contour your cheeks skin the buccal fat removal. Moxi Level3/Fontana 4D def made me hot again after 20lb weight loss causing signs of aging before my wedding.  Again do a series of 3 for max results.\nUltraclear did the most though, I would do all 3 until I die or go broke.\n\nBBL Laser: It works and makes you look like you have foundation on (and gets rid of under eye darkness) but because of techs fears of hyperpigmentation (a real fear) it's hard to find someone to do it. \n\nPRF/EZGEL: My under eyes looked better but also the swelling stretched out the skin so it also looks worse? Not worth it. PRF or PRP is useless, the gel is the only thing worth trying. \n\nLaser Hair Removal: Make sure they are using the newest machine that is practically painless, find a center that does a full body membership it's cheaper, you'll need 8-12 sessions. The painless one is worth it just get it done all over at \n\nMorpheus: painful and melts fat stay away. I did it 3 times, it got rid of my beautiful under eye fat pads, it slimmed my buccal fat, and it got rid of some acne though. It's not worth it due to pain and fat melting and lack of skin tightness effects it so claims. \n\nKatalyst EMS Suit >> Emsculpt: They cost the same and both work but you can keep Katalyst for life. Just use settings on abs/butt and get up to level 400,  you can thank me later! I had Emsculpt 5X on butt and AB's, it works temporary, now we own. 2 Katalyst suits and they make sure fit whenever we want and honestly just as fast. \n\nEmsella: Amazing for sex drive and preventing or helping with prolapse issues! Also works for urinary issues post kids :). Do 6 sessions for prevention and amazing sex. \n\nCoolsculpt: Bullshit. Can burn skin btw. \n\nHIFU: Melts fat. But it works:) so use in the right areas. \n\nJ Plasma: feels like lightening bolts attacking skin and limited outcome, stay away. \n\nPDO Threads: Forget it, painful, invasive, temporary. \n\nOmnilux Redlight Mask: Get the MENS version. It works. \n\nJovs: it breaks apparently l but I'm gonna try it and update yall later. Also curious about Amiro devices given what they say they do/tech they use. \n\nZIIP Halo + Silver Gel >Nuface: It works better than all the other main home microcurrent devices I've tried (nuface, medicube, 2 others on amazon) get the silver serum as daily easy skincare. Forget the other ones. \n\nThings on my list:\nSofwave, Emface (per reviews sounds useless?), Syllifirm, Profound, comment and lmk I'll try it if it sounds safe and effective. \n\nInjections: \nBotox: Prevent wrinkles (but tbh this is BS until you have a baby line forming), get rid of wrinkles, shrinks muscle. What I've liked: TMJ/Jaw Slimming (30-50U per side), TRAP TOX (amazing and makes your neck longer), LIP FLIP, NOSE TIP, BROW LIFT (only do the tail of the brow not the whole brow) and PLATYSMA (prevents face sagging and actually works, prob the most underrated and important area for Botox!).\n\nFiller: Deep Lasers (\"lift\" = volume) >> Sculptra (natural body makes volume) >> Slow Down on Fillers >> Injector >> Price/Injectable. Fly to the right person LA, Miami, or New York. Make sure the area they inject, they do often. Treat multiple areas BUT WITH 1/3 THE ACTUAL DOSE you want and go again twice. This prevents the botched look. Dissolve overfilled lips, it hurts, but it's worth it.\n\nALA/Glutathione/Vit C: Shrinks pores and evens out skin tone. Make sure to add ALA for max pore shrinking. It also helps regulate sugar. You can also opt for liposomal. Go to a reputable IV center and make sure to have labs to get ALA. \n\nPeels/SkinCare:\n30%+ Glycolic Acid On Body - Fast way to clear scars and evens out skin tone. Start low and increase slowly to prevent a burn. \n\nTCA Peel - Amazing for anti-aging tbh. But go to a spa and have them do it (face or full body) because it's more serious. \n\nMusely Spot Cream - Amazing stuff if you're lazy like me and don't like to do 100 things. Combines all the stuff you want for face skincare.\n\nApostrophe Triple Cream for Rosacea - Top 3 ingredients that work for rosacea in 1 bottle. Also look into low dose naltrexone. Also moxi or ultraclear helps.\n\nBenev Exosomes + Microneedling: Use for scars and face/body with a home microneedling pen (max the number of needles Dr Pen is good).\n\nCalecium Exosomes + Microneedling: A godsend for hair growth. \n\nRetinol Gel .1% + Stack With Hydration: get it prescribed. Level up to max %, look up how to layer with coconut oil/moisturizers/Benev to prevent the ugly phase (breakouts, dry skin). Don't need if have Musely spot cream or alternate days.\n\nClindamycin/Benzyl Peroxide Compound Cream: Get it prescribed and store it fridge now. It's the only thing that reliably clears up my acne overnight (I've tried dozens of acne products over 16 years). \n\nAlastin Skin Nectar: My main moisturizer post laser. * Wanted to add for Daily I use Prakti Maha mask because it works like under eye filler almost when you stack it on and gets rid of my acne without extra stuff about 60-70% of the time. I combine with Clarins double serum or snail stuff just depends. Also considering plated exosomes.\n\nOurself Lip Plumping: If you don't want lip filler or just want to maximize lip size try this brand it's from the makers of one of the actual fillers and it works.\n\nMinoxidil>Grandelash>Latisse: Latisse darks eyelids /under eyes and lose eye fat so stay away!! It's so hard to get that fat back!! Use castor oil for eyelash durability and oral minoxidil for eyelash growth. \n\nPills:\n\nOral Minoxidil: Max your eyelashes and hair volume\n\nLow Dose Accutane: Freeze eggs before doing this. Derm will prescribe for chronic acne especially if on back etc. It will also help reduce size of tip of nose if issues with rosacea or thick skin. Gets rid of acne but horrible side effects even at a low dose. \n\nSpirinolactone: NOT FOR ME - will give me headache, dehydration, makes me dumb because I'm so dehydrated, worse breakout for months, also just not worth taking this pill. It may work for others?\n\nEyes: Lumify (duh) \n\nHair: Nanoplastia > Keratin Straightening > KBond20 > Olaplex > Dyson \n\nTeeth: SMILE Whitening (in office dental procedure) INSANE will get you white instantly Request for double frequency teeth cleanings Purple Toothpaste = Safe Alternative to Home Teeth Whitening that works better Boka Nanohhydroxy Toothpaste (so you don't loose enamel) Toothbrush with Water Flosser Combined (another lazy girl hack) Therabreath (contains xylitol known to prevent cavities)\n\nMind Hacks: TDCS headband :) works for insomnia, works for mood I'll copy past all my comments into above later I use Elemind headband + Calm Sleep Powder for sleep after having sleep issues - (don't want to take meds, Benadryl is very bad for long term health and linked to increased dementia risk)\n\nMultivitamin: Make sure it has 5 methylfolate not \"folic\" acid. Try pure encapsulations or if you want to eat food-source multi try TEND prenatal bar chocolate flavor. \n\nVit D: Try to get level to 60-90 it's suppose to help with a lot of things including depression!! Alzheimer prevention! Even used by oncologists to decrese cancer risk!! I take 50k unit every week and recheck my level after a month to make sure it's atleast 80. I used to have depression. \n\nAstaxanthin: 2000x more potent antioxidant than Vit C. It can give you an orangish glow if you overuse or if you're aiming for that! I used to use Vit c and other antioxidants. \n\nOmega 3/DHA (fish derived not algae!): Take it or eat fish it's good for you. DHA 1000mg I've been using for 10 years and it makes me smarter and remember more for exams etc.\n\nSilica Drops + Collagen 10G Daily w Hylaronic Acid + 100G Protein Daily > Nutrafol > Biotin/Hair Nail Vitamins: yes the standard female nutrafol works, I prefer Minodixil it's faster and better for me and less big pills lol.  \n\n1G Water A Day - Eat good food, drink water. Take collagen, eat protein 100G daily, fat 50G daily. Otherwise this is useless. ADD POTASSIUM (prime powder packets) to SLIM FACE SWELLING. Add gua sha or lymph suction drainage also to help. Sauna/Ice Water on Face also works. \n\nLow Fat is a FAD - Hit 50G fat a day - obv is you need to optimize weight lower calories and cut inflammatory food like most non vegetable carbs. You can take a food allergy test also and optimize. For example no tomato skins, no onions for us. \n\nExercise (weights good for bones: BUT for brain benefits it's only with aerobic workouts!): increased bdnf and prevents depression also improved blood flow from skin - look into the research and thank me later - you need to burn 1200cal a week to hit this \n\nDairy Does Cause Breakouts - cut it out and see if there's a change for acne \n\nColustrum: ARMRA works better than others but they all work. It's good for gut health aka good for skin.\n\nSeed Probiotic: the best strains here. \n\nRosacea/Autoimmune Skin Stuff: Look into low dose naltrexone and astaxanthin. Autoimmune issues cause the face to look puffy! \n\nPCOS/Hunger Cravings: Inositol 6G powder or gummy inositol/myoinositol Vitamin: Tend Prenatal Bar (hate daily pills) Gummy CoQ10 200mg Tru Niagen NAD+ (gives me energy) OM matcha mushroom powder (this flavor specifically has a blend that makes me happy/laughing next day, I use when stressed) Silica Drops (makes my hair shiny, nails stronger within weeks) Zinc Picolinate 30mg (if sick or acne) Fisetin (or Qualia monthly) gets rid of dead cells I just feel good when I take it Vital Protein Collagen/Hylaronic Acid Dessicated Beef Liver or Shilajit (micronutrients) Multivitamin: Pure Encapsulations ONE\n\nI don't take pills daily except multivitamin or depending on my aim. But these are what work for me and what I've read that makes sense and I've tried without side effects and some benefit x Inpsitol is a miracle that everyone should know about it'll legit make you less anxious too\n\nDeodorant: Chlorella Liquid (removes body odor) > Native > Certaindri. want to try the weekly devices out there that actually stop sweating but weighing risks. Native covers me all day smelling good and I used to sweat through EVERYTHING. \n\nNails: basic - sally hansen hard as nails clear (drop 3-4 magenta drops of any brand in for a natural pink nail look) -  silica drops make nails tough af - only do RUSSIAN manicures they are magic thank me later\n\nSUN: the sun is your enemy for skincare, it's time to be aware of this all the time! Legally UV tint the max of your front car window (there's a way to uv protect without darkening so it's legal). Always wear long sleeves or a hat. Cover face with hand when walking and unprotected. I use supergoop clear sun stick because I'm lazy and it's a stick and doesn't have white caste. I'm sure there's better ones but this is the best clear stick I found. The powder makeup ones are BS and don't actually protect you. A HAT + Long Sleeves >>\n\nWeight Loss: I have a chubby face if my BMI is above 19 genetically. Find the BMI you need for optimizing your face. I drink all my water before eating. I drink black decaf with monk fruit (stevia is not as safe, Splenda is bad news) instead of lattes. I put all\nmy food on a salad instead of rice. I don't eat grain carbs because it makes me bloated. I eat spinach daily because it has highest potassium (reduces face bloating). I try to have have less than 1.5G salt daily. I also make sure there is IODINE in my salt for my thyroid (pink salt is causing iodine deficiencies and thus thyroid issues!). No dairy because it gives me acne (try cashew milk 25 cal). I hit 100G protein via NATURAL NO POWDER sources. Then I sleep by getting my fat intake (50g) and veggies cooked with seasoning I like or whatever I want to eat (kind of a baby Intermittant fast but more lax). If I'm craving sweets I eat frozen fruit and add fake honey (monk fruit sweetened avail sprouts). \n\n\nIf you made it this far, the most important thing is to be at a healthy weight, eat right, drink water, no alcohol (I've heard from friends: Passion flower extract \"anxiety\" > IV NAD (addiction)), no smoking(I've heard from friends: Chantix > Wellbutrin> Nicotine Patch > Tapering Nicotine Vape ), no all nighters (if insomnia look above TDCS headband elemind > Calm Sleep Powder > Sublingual Melatonin). \n\nThis is all I could think of but I've tried a lot feel free to DM me.\nI've also deep dived into fertility and dementia stuff for friends/family! If you want reccs DM! You can fact check me but I research this stuff just like we all do so you'll find out or realize this is likely the consensus. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "I love your list and thank you for this!\nI’d like to add a couple things. \n\nYou mentioned iodine for thyroid. \nUnfortunately this is a common misconception and can be a bit dangerous. The most common form of thyroid disorder in the US and in the western world in general is Hashimoto’s (which is what I have). Excess iodine is actually terrible for Hashimoto’s and should be avoided. Iodine for thyroid is only in the case of goiter, which is extremely rare in the US. (i’m a certified health coach and I do an insane amount of research on autoimmune).\n\nYou mentioned a red light therapy mask. \nThose are great, but a panel is much more effective. I’ve been using a panel for the past year and I’ve been very happy with the results! You also mentioned Latisse - red light therapy can actually grow your lashes naturally without the extra expense or risk. My lashes have grown so much in the past year!\n\nYou mentioned chlorella for deodorant, but it’s actually also great for many other things. I take chlorella tablets and they are great for your immune system, your energy levels and even your skin. However, it is important to make sure you buy a good source of chlorella that is unpolluted. The tablets that I take are also iodine-free, which is important for my Hashimoto’s.\n\nYou mentioned monk fruit - what brand do you like? I’ve been looking for a good one, but the ones I found are all mixed with other stuff that I don’t want to consume.\n\nI truly don’t mean any of this to criticize, I really appreciate your post! It’s just that I do a ton of research on this stuff, but I learned a lot from your post as well ❤️",

My skin is starting to loose its lift and I did Morpheus too, as my lower cheek or just around the jaw line fat was too much. My jowls are beginning to grow and irritate me too now. I have under eye bags that looks so so ugly I wish it was just dark I wouldn’t care, have been spending on PRP it only stays or looks tight for a day and goes back the next day. Never heard about a gel, I assume it’s a gel product they will sell and I will apply at home. BBLazer I am so wanting a skin like that, foundation look so I am going to find out with all the places if they do, I until now have done peels like clear skin malanage that gives this look too but only for 15 days. What is playtisma you mentioned here, is that an area or a kind of Botox? Lastly the IV glutathione is the general IB injection right? Not something they now inject directly to face.. just wanted to make sure thanks a ton",

Since I was 17 I’ve struggled with Male pattern baldness. I started fin when I was 21 took it for 6-8 weeks with topical minoxidil saw no difference and had to stop because of side effects instant low Libido and thoughts of S.H. I was in a bad place then and couldn’t commit to anything \n(I have Bipolar 2 disorder) the past year I’ve worked on many many things I lost over 60 lbs and completely changed my lifestyle but my hair was at its WORST STATE I focused on my overall health and well being. January 1st I shaved my head started fin 1 mg once a day and minoxidil 5% 2 times a day. Ketonconazole shampoo 3 times a week derma roller 1-2 times a week, A biotin supplement and Mielle rosemary and mint oil once a day before bed it’s completely changed my hair I want to say that I and my derm believe i am a “hyper responder” to these products. Most people will not see results as quickly as I did but it is still possible to regrow your hair if you commit to it. From January to today. I shaved my head 3 times to even it out with new growth on top. within the first 3 weeks i noticed tons of hair growth in my receding hairline I thought to be just vellus hairs and was thinking during the shedding phase that I went though in February they wouldn’t come back. But I was wrong and they came back so fast and very dark. I did start to have side effects like excesses dribbling while urinating/ pelvic floor issues and again low libido but they subsided after 4 weeks. This has helped me regain so much confidence. ",

It’s not a wonder drug, the side effects are terrible and some don’t show after the first few years, but after 5-10 years new studies have linked finasteride intake to optical atrophy and other oculotoxic sideeffect.\n\nhttps://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2690754\n\nCopy of the internet pages that discusses 3 publications: (References at the bottom)\n\nHealth Implications\nThis evidence suggests that long-term use of Finasteride may result in hidden but significant eye damage. Due to the severe implications, baseline eye exams may be advisable for patients starting this medication to prevent possible irreversible effects.\n\nConclusion: Caution Advised for Finasteride Users\nGiven Finasteride’s potential risks to eye health, physicians and patients should exercise caution with its use. There is growing evidence that blocking DHT affects more than just hair and prostate health; it can damage vision, among other serious risks. Patients should report any unusual vision symptoms to a healthcare provider, and more awareness is needed to ensure these risks are widely known.\n\nLinks:\n\nMacular Abnormalities Associated With 5α-Reductase Inhibitor\n\nReferences\nBrooks, M.

Breast cancer is a bitch!\n\n\\- Don't have sex a few days before your pap. You will get abnormal cell results.

Even if they are crooked or yellow, they still deserve to be brushed and flossed!\n\n\\- Stay away from scented wipes and TP. The perfumes are irritating to the delicate microbiomes.

        "body": "Know your inseam measurement. I am a personal stylist for women’s jeans. One of the reasons Jeans don’t fit is because the length is wrong. I know, the waist and rise are the biggest problem areas for most jeans but hear me out. I always start by finding the right inseam length for my clients and eliminating anything that won’t work for their length. There is enough length diversity out there that you really shouldn’t be needing to get jeans tailored and it usually ends up being one more thing women feel bad about. Jeans are already a harrowing experience. And to be honest, I don’t like getting jeans tailored for my clients unless they want to pay a lot for. It’s expensive to get it right because hem jobs will often require the rest of the leg to be retapered otherwise it will look and fit wonky. The shorter you need to go, the more apparent it is. \n\nIt’s shocking how many women don’t know this number though. But it makes sense since women’s sizing doesn’t include length the way men’s jeans do. Take a pair of pants that fit you, measure the inseam, and commit the number to memory. When shopping online you can find that measurement in the jeans description. \n\nOnce I eliminate jeans that are too short or long it’s way easier to just focus on getting the waist and hip fit right.\n\nPro tips: use Zappos to shop for jeans. They have a massive catalog at a bunch of price points, a fantastic return policy, and you can literally sort by inseam measurement.",

If you do this from age 22 to age 30, you'll be well on your way to having a very strong safety net. \n\n**- Make a budget.** If you're spending every dollar that comes in, you're doing it wrong. Go through your income and all your expenses- saving even $20/day adds up to $140/week, $480/mo, or $5,760/yr. In 5 years, you'll have over $25,000 in savings and that's without any growth. \n\n**- Learn to invest in the markets.** Crucial. Even if its $1,000/yr. Read up a bit on stocks, bonds, real estate. You can do it. Even at 30k/yr.\n\n**- Follow your passions, but do market research on what that degree pays.** This is very important. The millennial generation was lied to and all were encouraged to \"follow their dreams.\" You should follow your heart but also do your homework, how much does that degree pay? How many job openings? Will you have to move?  \n\n**- Don't ever compromise on your job/education for a romantic relationship.** That boyfriend you swore you'd marry at 16 is probable gone. That one at 22 is probably gone as well. Maybe even the one at 26. Point is, romantic relationships come and go.

If, god forbid, you end up in a dangerous situation, always always strike the person’s head. As hard as you humanly can. Don’t waste your strength, time and energy on hitting any other body part. Aim for the head. If it doesn’t give them a concussion, it will disorient them enough for you to bolt out of there!\n\n\nAlso, eat as much fresh fruits and vegetables as you possibly can, every single day. You skin, nails, hair, and hormones will thank you.",

    "body": "Hey everyone, I had some free time today and I figured I would write up a top 10 list of most mistakes people make/need to avoid when treating/dealing with hair loss. I know most of this will just be common knowledge to some of you, but if this post helps even 1 person in their treatment of hair loss, I will consider it mission accomplished.\n\n1. Using Minoxidil/Rogaine only: Mixnoxidil/Rogaine is what most people instantly turn to as it is marketed as an effective treatment in those who notice they are losing hair. However, using Minoxidil alone DOES NOT STOP HAIRLOSS, merely it is a vasodilator that helps stimulate hair follicles and may promote hair growth. You need to address the root cause of you actually losing hair, which is the presence of DHT in your scalp if you want long-term results, rather than just using a hair follicle stimulant alone. Think about it this way: Imagine you have a bucket full of water and there is a hole at the bottom causing the water to slowly leak out. You wouldn't go about fixing this by simply pouring more water into the bucket.... That would be ineffective as the water would continue to leak and would eventually be completely gone. You would want to plug the hole and stop the water from leaking to solve the problem, only THEN would pouring more water be of any help. I hope this analogy helps people understand why minoxidil alone is ineffective. I know you may be thinking, \"but I saw someone get really good results quick with just minoxidil\". Even if an individual got really good immediate results or was a hyper responder of some sort, I promise you that you are not going to defeat an androgenic hormone with just a vasodilator in the long run. Minoxidil ALONE will inevitably become a diminishing return.\n2. Letting yourself get too far gone: The most important factor in treating/recovering from hair loss is catching/treating it early. As many of you have probably heard: It is WAY easier to keep what you have than get back what you have lost. This is why it is important to be proactive and get on top of it early. Too many guys wait too long, let way too many follicles burn off, and then just assume they can get a transplant whenever. Do not let any bald person tell you or convince you that they can \"just get a transplant whenever they feel like it\". That is NOT how that works. If you have already burned off most of the follicles on you're head, particularly on the top/center, a transplant most likely won't do anything. It would cost an arm and a leg for the number of follicles you would need, you may not even have enough donor's hairs. Even if it is possible, you likely still won't' have good density. As transplants are usually only effective for hairline restoration. Do NOT wait to get on top of it if you catch it early.\n3. Not using an anti-androgen: Similar to the analogy I made about the bucket of water, I cannot emphasize enough that you need to address/stop the root cause of your hair loss. As most of you may know, that is your genetic response to the presence of DHT in your scalp. If you are not using an anti-androgen of some sort that addresses DHT (Finasteride, topical Finasteride, RU58841, Trentonian, etc) your protocol will be ineffective long-term as your MPB will catch up with you even if you are using stimulants (Minoxidil, Dermaroller). I am personally very pro-finasteride, but I respect the fact that some may be hesitant and some do get sides, so I don't say you MUST use it specifically. But, if you are serious about treating hair loss, you need SOMETHING that addresses DHT or your protocol is basically useless long term. Take it from someone who used rogaine only for 1 year and only regressed.\n4. Using/Buying into 'natural treatment': Just like every other industry, there is a lot of bullshit and scams in the hair loss industry. I'll keep this one simple; if you suffer from MPB, your hair is 'naturally' falling out. How the hell are you going to 'naturally' reverse what is 'naturally' happening. Anyone who tells you that you can do so is full of it. These are usually the same people who will make it sound like Finasteride/Minoxidil will literally kill you. If you want to go the true 'natural' route, let your hair continue to fall out and go bald. That is natural.\n5. Using/Counting a biotin supplement as a treatment: To put it simply; a biotin supplement will do absolutely nothing in treating/reversing hair loss. Does this mean taking it is bad? Absolutely not. It is a nutrient that does promote healthy hair, skin, and nails. But to be fair, if you eat eggs, nuts, sweet potatoes, etc, you are 'taking' biotin. I'm not saying don't take it, I'm saying don't expect it to do anything in the treatment of hair loss. It is so frustrating to hear guys say 'Ya I tried taking biotin and it didn't do anything\". BIOTIN IS NOT A HAIRLOSS TREATMENT.\n6. Using Minoxidil Twice a day: Now this isn't necessarily a mistake, in essence, there is nothing wrong with using it twice a day. It is more so unnecessary and could end up saving you money, along with not have to do the tedious act of applying a greasy foam/liquid into your hair as often. The half-life of topical minoxidil is 18 hours, therefore there is no additional benefit to applying it twice a day. Once a day is plenty sufficient. You will save money and time. It is also way more convenient considering you have to continue minoxidil as long as you want to keep your results from it. Now, I know what you're thinking \"but everywhere on the container, it says to use twice per day\". Do you really think the manufacturer is going to tell you to use their product less?\n7. Not Giving it Time: This is perhaps the most important part of the list. Just like hair loss is a slow progressive process, so is hair loss reversal/treatment. You don't just go to bed one day with a full head of hair and wake up the next day balding. Just like you don't go from balding back to baseline in a matter of weeks of treatment. I know it is not what people want to hear but you really need to give it time and be patient. I would say a minimum of 6-12 months before you determine that ANYTHING is 'not working'. Many people on finasteride don't see full results until at least the 1-year mark. Hang in there and when you do see the result after months of consistency, it will feel so much more rewarding.\n8. Listening to the people who tell you \"just shave it\" \"bald looks sick\" etc: Let's not live in fantasy land here guys. We do not all look like The Rock, Jason Statham, Bruce Willis, and whoever else. 90% of us could probably NOT pull off the bald look due to a variety of factors. There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with not wanting to go bald and intervening with treatment. Anyone who tells you otherwise needs to mind their dam business. It is about how YOU feel, if your hair loss bothers you/affects your confidence, do something about it. If you are 100% ok with going bald, more power to you, I admire you. Most of us are not.\n9. Overcomplicating Treatment/protocol: Although balding really sucks, treatment is really not that complicated when you understand how it works. Many people are so concerned with optimizing every possible detail using 5 different treatments and such. Bear in mind, hair loss treatment is a lifelong commitment. Many people can get away with just finasteride alone if they catch it early enough. Think about it, do you really want to have to do some super complicated treatment full of topicals, vitamins, dietary restrictions, fancy shampoos, etc, every day for the rest of you're life? Fin/Minox with dermarolling if necessary is plenty. Something to address and prevent further loss and something to stimulate hair growth is plenty enough.\n10. Obsessing over your hair loss: I don't want this to be a super corny part where I tell you guys that you are beautiful no matter what or that you look just as good bald, or your loss isn't even that bad blah blah blah. But I will say this, a balding man who is not insecure about it is more attractive than a balding man who radiates insecurity. As much as hair loss sucks and believe me, I know the damage it does to self-confidence, I was fortunate to start losing my hair at 18, hair loss isn't the complete end of the world. If you are CONSTANTLY worrying about checking your hair in the mirror, taking pictures on your phone, worrying others are noticing it, this will significantly lower your quality of life, I speak from experience. By all means get on treatment if you notice you are losing your hair, but do not obsess over it, it will do you absolutely no good.\n\nIf you actually read this, or most of it, or even some of it, thank you, I appreciate your time and hope you took something away from it. Stay strong my balding brethren we will get through this.\n\nTLDR; Just read the numbered list.",

Since my brother got the moon by he was 26 so my dad got worried about me and started a few things. I have tried for the last 2-3 yrs natural products, chemicals, homeo, etc etc. All these are useless and temporary only. The best thing is changing diet. Get your blood test done and see what vitamins and minerals you lack and focus your diet on that. I have tried Minoxidil for 4 months. There was no improvement on the head but I had a side effect and started growing thick hair on the below side of my arms. So I stopped that. Before this we have tried various oils. None they were really helpful. Tried Homeo. Controlled the hair loss to some extent but didn't entirely solve the problem. Best is check your blood for what it lacks and make sure your head is getting proper flow of blood. If you are too tensed in general then the muscles in on your skill tighten and the flow of blood is restricted. So just reduce stress for it. Changing diet and lifestyle are the only viable options",

But if you are really desperate like me you can try this treatment for 5-6 months (I started seeing some improvement in the first month, after 2-3 months I saw good improvement and after 6 months I got desired results).

But, during December I've seen my face got little puffy and also dark circles got worse which I never had in my life. So that's when I dig a rabbit hole on internet about the side effects of minoxidil. Some effects were terrified me that how can I use this drug in the long run. It's also bit cost effective for me to buy every month. Later I found out some studies on minoxidil 2% vs rosemary oil which was equally effective for hair regrowth. So I've started using rosemary and castor oil since may this year and reduced the minoxidil usage. I've also started using derma roller on alternative days and by July end things got well. On August 1st week I shaved my head and for 20 days i Haven't used minoxidil and only used rosemary and castor oil i still noticed hair thinning. Since then I've started using minoxidil (3-4 days a week ) along with rosemary and castor oil and i noticed my hair growth was pretty quick than normal and I also noticed my hair was thick.but still I had to fight with hair thinning by making my lifestyle better.",

I've been on fin and min now for the last 6 months and I'm starting to get the density back! \n\nSo if anyone is young, don't listen to those who say wait till you BALD, no! \n\nGet on FIN + MIN and save yourself the headache of FUE/FUT transplants!!",

    "body": "If your dogs are fuzzy vacuum cleaners like mine is, then you should probably make sure you know what to keep them away from. And if you have a cats... well I'm not quite sure why you would have a cat instead of a dog, but you probably still shouldn't poison them. \n\nHere's the list of foods that can make your pets ill. Some of them can be fatal: \n\n* Chocolate-- fast heart rate, hallucinations, severe diarrhea, epileptic seizures, heart attacks, internal bleeding, and eventually death\n\n* Ethanol (Alcohol)-- animals are generally more susceptible to alcohol than humans are. The caveats here are similar to alcohol poisoning in humans. \n\n* Raw yeast dough--  intestinal obstruction and/or ethanol poisoning \n\n* Hops (beer hops) Edit: the plant, not necessarily beer itself. --  malignant hyperthermia in dogs, usually with fatal results\n\n* Avocados-- possible damage to the heart muscle cells, leading to heart failure\n\n* Grapes/raisins-- acute kidney failure\n\n* Macadamia nuts-- non-fatal stiffness, tremors, hyperthermia, and abdominal pain\n\n* Onions, garlic, shallots, etc.--  hemolytic anemia\n\n* Xylitol (sweetner found in gum and other sugar-free things)-- toxic or even fatal liver damage\n\n* Moldy or rotten food-- some molds produce toxins called tremorgenic mycotoxins, which can cause serious or even life-threatening problems if ingested by dogs.\n\n* Raw meats and raw eggs-- Salmonella and E. coli can be bad. Raw eggs contain an enzyme called avidin that decreases the absorption of biotin (a B vitamin), which can lead to skin and coat problems.\n\n* Salt-- Large amounts of salt can produce excessive thirst and urination, or even sodium ion poisoning in pets; vomiting, diarrhea, depression, tremors, elevated body temperature, seizures and even death.\n\n* Milk-- mammals are naturally lactose intolerant \n\n* Bones-- choking hazard; splintering can cause damage to soft tissues. \n\nNow here's a shitty picture of my dog being [weird.](http://i.imgur.com/1CArC4w.jpg?1) \n\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control/people-foods-avoid-feeding-your-pets\n\nhttp://www.aspca.org/pet-care/virtual-pet-behaviorist/dog-behavior/foods-are-hazardous-dogs\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_health#Dangerous_foods\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_health#Toxic_substance\n\nEdit:\n\nBecause a lot of people are unhappy about the raw meat/bones, it should probably be clarified that a lot of raw meat isn't really healthy for your dogs/cats, especially if they aren't used to it. So if you're pet has been eating 3 pounds of raw meat every day for the past 8 years, you're probably safe; if your pet's food is primarily pet food, then you should probably be careful. \n\nAnd about the bones, I know for a fact that bones can splinter and lodge in soft tissues internally. Chicken bones are the worst in my experience, though beef and pork have never made my animals sick. \n\nEdit 2: ffs, feed your dogs all the raw meat you want. See if I care!\n\nEdit 3: to be more correct, mammals are lactose intolerant outside of their infancy",

Ref (3)\n\n+ Omega-3 fatty acids: for antioxidant effects and improving scalp circulation. Ref (4)\n\n+ Key vitamins & minerals: including iron, selenium, and biotin. Ref (3)\n\nCustomized topicals:\n\nI use a personalized Rx formula based on my genetics to prevent and reverse hair loss. Roots byGA (5)\n\nHere are the ingredients in my formulation: Minoxidil (7%), Cetirizine HCl (1%), Latanoprost (0.004%), Dutasteride (0.25%), Melatonin (0.1%), Caffeine (0.2%), Tretinoin (0.0125%), Vitamin D3 (1,000IU/ML), Vitamin E (10 IU/ML).\n\n5% minoxidil is a solid budget alternative. Apply 1 mL to scalp at night or in the morning (or both), massage thoroughly.\n\nRed light therapy:\n\nSix minutes a day and you can be doing your morning routine as you wear it.  A study on 44 males (age 18-49) showed that treatment with 655nm laser cap for 25 min every other day for a duration of 16 weeks resulted in a 39% increase in hair growth compared to placebo. Ref (6)\n\nOral minoxidil:\n\nI take 3.75 mg a day. I started with 2.5 mg and evaluated for side effects.\n\nIn a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial involving 90 men with androgenetic alopecia AGA, oral minoxidil (5 mg daily) was found to have similar efficacy to topical minoxidil (5% solution applied twice daily) after 24 weeks.Ref (7)\n\nOral minoxidil is generally considered safe at low doses, but it can have side effects such as hypertrichosis (excessive hair growth) and headaches.\n\nWhen starting any new hair regimen:\n\n+ Start slow\n+ Introduce 1 product at a time\n+ Monitor closely for side effects\n+ Give each addition 3 months to show results\n+ 5% minoxidil alone is sufficient for many\n+ Consider personalization based on your genetic profile, health, diet type and nutritional condition to reverse any deficiencies (e.g. omega3, protein...) revealed by blood testing.\n\nFull thread on X/Twitter:\n\nhttps://x.com/bryan_johnson/status/1848809345313649126?s=46",

    "body": "I used to be an ugly duckling in high school (years ago), who was overlooked by everyone. I didn't feel comfortable in my own skin, and it showed. I made a list one day, listing out all of the things I wanted to improve on myself, and slowly, one by one, I managed to improve all of them. So I thought I'd pass on some of what I learned, to hopefully help others.\n\nFirstly though, I just wanted to say, that if you are still in **high school**, you're likely still in that awkward phase most people go through. Your looks WILL improve as you age, no doubt about it. Look forward to the fact that you haven't peaked yet (unlike some of the other Staceys in your class).\n\nBelow are all of the steps I have implemented over the years to improve myself.\n\n* **Hair**:  \n\n   * Get your hair professionally cut (if you can). Pick a color that suits you. Go to a stylist and get their opinions on it. If you can't afford it, there are a lot of videos online also teaching you color theory, and the best cut for you.\n   * KEEP IT CLEAN. Nothing worse than greasy hair. Use dry shampoo, it helps build volume, and helps keep it from looking greasy in between washes.\n   * Use a shampoo that smells good, with no sulfates and parabens\n   * Use hair volumizer spray (the one I use is by WOW Hair)/curl conditioner if it's curly\n   * Blow-dry it if you're going out, upside-down if it's flat. With a diffuser if it's wavy/curly. But don't bother if you're not going out for a while. It'll ruin your hair.  \n\n      * For my friends with straight hair, use a round brush to get that blown-out look (search videos). It looks great, and gives it volume for days\n* **Skin/Body**  \n\n   * If you have acne-prone skin, make an appointment with a derm/doctor and get a prescription for Accutane/Tretinoin/Benzol Peroxide. Make sure you go to a doctor though, because not all of these are suitable for everyone, and it's got contraindications.  \n\n      * I've also heard that Curology is a pretty good line who custom makes skincare products\n      * If you have cystic acne, I've heard the elimination diet can do wonders. It might be triggered by something you're eating.\n      * When I was in high school, I had these horrible little bumps all over my forehead. I used Proactiv and that really helped me (but don't use it if you're using any of the medications I mentioned above, it'll be too much for your skin to handle, and it will become raw and inflamed)\n   * Check out [r/AsianBeauty](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/) for advice on how to take care of your skin, and make it GLOW  \n\n      * They will have different solutions for different skin concerns\n      * I personally use:\n      * AM: Micellar water to cleanse, Vitamin C serum, light layer of Hada Labo HA Moisturizer, Missha Sun milk sunscreen\n      * PM: Double cleanse at night, Hada Labo HA Moisturizer, and either Tretinion or iunik beta glucan cream on top of the hyaluronic face cream\n      * Watch Dr. Dray on YouTube, she's got great skincare advice\n      * This is what works for me, but I have also outgrown my acne phase\n   * USE SUNSCREEN every day, and protect your assets.\n   * Tretinoin can help to keep your skin looking flawless as you age (for those who are older also)  \n\n      * For tretinoin, EASE INTO THIS SLOWLY!!!! If you don't your skill will be 10000x worse\n      * Watch videos on how to start with minimal irritation\n   * Use vitamin C serum for those with hyperpigmentation.  \n\n      * (I use Skinceuticals CE Ferulic, but it's pretty expensive.)\n      * I've also heard good things about Paula's Choice products, which are easier on the wallet\n   * Moisturize your body as soon as you get out of the shower, while it's still wet  \n\n      * (Dr. Dray's advice)\n   * If you have the money, go visit a dermatologist. They can recommend lasers/fillers/botox\n   * If you are oily, it can be from dehydrated skin. Treat your skin right. There are ways to fix this.  \n\n      * It's probably instinct to start washing/exfoliating tf out of your skin, but it may make it worse, and your skin could start producing more oils to compensate\n   * Get your nails done, either at home or at a salon. I personally like gel polish because I do it once/twice a month and forget about it.\n   * Shave/epilate/wax! This includes your leg hair, your hoohah, your underarms, your arms (if they are hairy), your face, sideburns, etc.\n* **Face**  \n\n   * I had my brows microbladed, and it looks great with minimal effort\n   * I had fillers in my lips, it's elevated my look even more  \n\n      * I've also been considering lip blushing, it's like microblading for your lips, and looks like you have lipstick on all the time\n   * I use the generic version of Latisse (in the evenings before bed), which is available by prescription (called Bimatoprost) for a fraction of the cost. But again, with all prescriptions, talk to your doctor about it  \n\n      * I also use a lash conditioning serum from Etude House (before bed)\n      * And in the mornings I use LashEnvy before I apply makeup\n      * I used to get lash extensions but was too hard/expensive to keep up with\n   * Keep blotting paper on you if you have oily skin, shiny is not a good look.\n* **Makeup**  \n\n   * I would honestly just recommend watching YouTube tutorials to find out what works\n   * I personally use liquid eyeliner (Nyx), with mascara (Maybelline Falsies are the best I've found), and a tiny bit of foundation and bronzer for slight contouring  \n\n      * You can always go to Sephora for a free consult on what looks good for you\n   * But all of this can't help if you don't take care of your skin first.\n* **Clothes**  \n\n   * Find out what clothes flatter your body, and your style\n   * Justine Leconte has some good videos on this, and I'm sure you could find lots on this\n   * I've had personal success buying a bunch of black turtlenecks from Uniqlo, and pairing it with dark blue jeans and sticking to that look. It's minimal effort, and makes me look very polished (but again, I'm a bit older, so it might not be everyone's style)\n   * You don't need to spend a fortune on clothes, focus on good quality material and styles that flatter your body, and you FEEL COMFORTABLE in. There's nothing worse than someone who obviously is uncomfortable\n   * For the winter, wear low-cut booties, they are very in style. For summer, wear wedges/sandals/runners etc. Don't wear socks with sandals, it was never a good look, and never will be.\n* **General Health (Physical & Mental) \\*MOST IMPORTANT PART- SERIOUSLY!!!\\***  \n\n   * Obviously, you need to eat right, eat clean in order for your body to look good. Don't calorie restrict, it doesn't work in the long run  \n\n      * Don't take any diet pills to try to lose weight. I have before and gained all of it back and then some. Just don't. It's terrible for your health.\n   * Look into intermittent fasting, I've had success with it, and it keeps me from grazing all day. Plus it has some possible health benefits\n   * Don't smoke, your body will be pissed off\n   * Go to the gym! HIIT is amazing. Work on your flexibility, go to yoga. Work on your inner peace and confidence, meditate at night and in the morning.  \n\n      * Do glute exercises, and drink protein shakes (if it's okay for your age)\n   * Make yourself a list of goals you want to achieve in your life outside of just looks.  \n\n      * What do you want to achieve in your life/career? What are your 5 or 10-year goals?\n      * I can PROMISE you, after having gone through it that the good quality men don't want just a pretty face, with ZERO ambition. The ones who are looking for pretty will dump them. There's a power imbalance there.\n      * You want to be confident of your achievements on top of your looks.\n   * Since everyone is stuck inside at the moment, take some time to reflect on the skills you want to build.\n   * LEARN A SKILL. Being good at something is one of the biggest confidence boosters you can gain. Your self-esteem will thank you.\n   * Personality becomes extremely important in relationships\n   * CharismaOnDemand on YouTube has some great tips on how to build confidence, and become charismatic. You want to be the person that people want to talk to.\n\nAnyways, that's all I can come up with for now. Become the best version of yourself inside and out. Again, don't just focus on looks. Build your awesome personality, and let it shine too, I was ugly during high school, but people still liked me, because I was forced to develop a good personality.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you want any personal advice. I know how hard it was, and I would like to pass it on :).\n\nEdit: I also take collagen supplements and biotin. Makes the skin glow, and nails strong. Again, speak to your doctor before taking anything.",

        "body": "Great guide! I’d just like to add that if you truly want perfect skin and hair, besides using sunscreen (which is like the bare minimum), I really suggest looking into microneedling. I’ve been dealing with acne scars and large pores my whole life, basically, my skin just looked bad, let’s say it that way lol. I also had a receding hairline and couldn’t tolerate fin.\n\nAfter doing serious research, I realized microneedling could actually help with all of that. I got myself a high-quality pen, and within 2 or 3 months (Can't remember if it was after my third or forth session), my skin had never looked better. For the scalp, though, it took longer—around 4 months to see real results. The micro damage forces your skin to produce collagen and boosts blood circulation, which is super important.\n\nI’d definitely add that to your amazing guide because I believe it could solve 90% of the issues people are dealing with, not just scars or hair loss, but also uneven skin tone, hyperpigmentation… basically anything when it comes to skin or hair concerns.\n\n**EDIT** \\- The pen I am using is KorabeauticaIs V2 Pro\n\nProtocol for the skin : 1.5mm depth once a month (Around the eyes and forehead I do 0.5mm).\n\nFor the scalp, I do 1mm every 7-10 days.",

        "body": ">KEEP IT CLEAN. Nothing worse than greasy hair. Use dry shampoo, it helps build volume, and helps keep it from looking greasy in between washes.\nUse a shampoo that smells good, with no sulfates and parabens\n\n\nJust to expand on the hair advice. Dry shampoo usually has silicones in as do many hair products, including many conditioners. Silicones cause product build-up on your scalp and hair which can cause itchiness, dandruff and can cause your hair to look limp and volumeless. Your hair could also become drier and frizzy because the silicones coat the hair follicle as prevent moisture from fully penetrating. If you have wavy or curly hair, your hair may become straighter and less defined from the products weighing it down. \n\nSulphates, while harsh, are great at removing build-up. Whereas, many no-poo and low-poo shampoos that are less harsh and better for your hair overall often can't remove silicones. If you're cutting out sulphates, I'd recommend either cutting down or cutting out silicones too. And I would also recommend a clarifying wash with a silicone-free sulphate shampoo to remove build-up every once in a while. How often you need to clarify depends on your hair type and how much product build-up you usually have.",

        "body": "My only gripe about this is sunscreen. Which was proven to be one of the leading causes of skin cancer. The suns rays MIGHT give you cancer slowly, but sunscreens WILL give you cancer long before you would have kicked the bucket, otherwise. \n\nJust take the natural L and absorb that sun. Worried about sunburn? Wear a sun hat, and make sure to frequently take a shade break. \n\nRemember, your skin is an organ too. It’s vital and we should take good care of it.\n\n(You can shill burn in the shade, I recommend wearing all white, as it beats the heat and sunlight away from your body. white reflects the sunlight) \n\nIf you end up burning anyway, don’t use lotion, it takes forever to heal and it can hurt depending on the lotion. Just use Aloe Vera. If you have a plant, cut some off and scrape the “plant guts” onto your hand and smear it on your burn and let it absorb. \n\nIf you don’t have the plant, you can buy a bottle up at Walmart. (It doesn’t expire so it’s worth it) \n\n9 times out of 10 it’ll be healed the next day. Or within 2 to 3 days. Lotion takes too long. Takes me an average of a week or longer to heal, using lotion. \nLotion is a moisturizer, however aloe is the, if not. One of the most natural form of lotion you can come across. Don’t question why it works better. It makes sense.\n\nYou can also use aloe as sun screen. It will work.\nThere are many natural remedies that will work, and not cause cancer in the long run. \n\nAnd sure it may be a little pricy. But you should see those bills when you get out of the hospital later. You’ll wish you spent that extra money on your health, when you were younger.",

I started taking vitamins including collagen, biotin, magnesium, zinc, a multivitamin, L-glutamine, probiotic, and sugar bear hair gummies. I also started sleeping in a silk bonnet (it was an odd adjustment but I sleep fine now). I use a rosemary tonic spray every morning and night and also before and after I wash my hair. I changed shampoo and conditioner. \n\nThis has been a long time coming but I’m satisfied with my regrowth. The length is slowly but surely coming back but the biggest difference has been the thickness. Even my fiancé noticed the thickness increase. (Thankfully I have over 2 years until my wedding so I have plenty of time to grow it back out). It has been an emotional roller coaster because my hair is my safety blanket. I cannot tell you guys how much I cried my eyes out when I first saw the back of my head in February and how embarrassed I was of it. But now, even though it’s not 100% grown in, I feel loads more confident and comfortable in my skin again. I hope everyone can find the same comfort and confidence I have been able to get back 💕",

I'm turning 30 this month, and developing a bald spot felt too early—but I also hadn't dared to try any medication.\n\nSince early April (Picture 2), I’ve been taking 1mg of Finasteride and using 5mg of Minoxidil along with microneedling. I take one Finasteride tablet daily and apply topical Minoxidil twice a day. I do microneedling 1–2 times per week. I also supplement with zinc and biotin.\n\nI’m very satisfied and really happy with the progress. People often comment on my appearance and are confused about why I suddenly look so different. Most don’t realize it’s because of my hair—until I show them a before photo.\n\n",

    "body": " \n\nThe average man tends to lack general hair styling knowledge, since it isn’t plainly or cohesively explained very often. This manuscript serves as a simple, comprehensive guide for the average man to consistently, quickly, and easily have salon-quality hair on a daily basis. This guide is organized into three subcategories for your convenience.\n\n* Disclaimer: For whatever reasons, some guys seem to think it’s *gay* or *effeminate* to condition and maintain your hair. It’s not.\n\n**SHOWER**\n\nThe distinctive qualities of stylish hair are the form and texture. Showering with the right products provides the base for a good style.\n\n1 Use *volumizing* or *thickening* shampoos\n\n* Look for shampoos that contain **biotin** or **collagen**. Most reliable products contain these ingredients because they are responsible for providing cell structure, which for our purposes means thick, dense, and healthy hair.\n* Don’t use shampoo *every* day. Shampoos by design are meant to strip oils, grime, dirt, and other impurities from the scalp. But hair is meant to have certain healthy oils to keep the follicle and shaft lubricated, hydrated, and nourished. Overuse of shampoo dries out the scalp, starving it of these essential components. Use shampoo only when your hair appears greasy or if you haven’t used it a handful of days.\n\n2 Conditioner is optional\n\n* Use a conditioner if your hair is dry. Conditioners by design are meant to hydrate hair, providing sheen with a soft, luscious quality.\n* Don’t use a conditioner if your hair is fine, thin, limp, or oily. Conditioners will make greasy hair greasier. Most conditioners are heavy in a sense that they weigh down hair. This makes limp hair appear even more flat. Hair that’s heavy from conditioners is also hard to style effectively.\n* Look for a *weightless* and volumizing conditioner if you decide to use one. Use a small amount of conditioner, about a dime sized amount. Apply conditioner to the shaft of the hair, but not the roots. This helps prevent weighing hair down.\n* Conditioner affects your hair aesthetically in different ways depending on how much you use and the quality of your hair. So experiment with it to find the best results, which could come from using none at all.\n\n**DRYING**\n\nThe most vital factor to having excellent salon-quality hair that *keeps its hold* is how you dry it. The key to **ALL** salon-quality hairstyles is a combination of heat, water, and direction. Hair will stay in the direction it's dried if you comb it as you dry it. The heat from a blow dryer will perforate the shaft of the hair, making the filaments expand and the pores expand. This makes the hair retain the direction it’s combed and provides volume. Also, some people use a pre-styler before they dry their hair to give their hair distinctive features. \n\n1 Towel dry your hair until it’s damp but not dry.\n\n2 Pre-styler (optional)\n\n* Sea salt spray: Adds a distinct texture, due to the salts property of retaining moisture\n* Argan oil: Provides a rich, deep, coppery shine and protects against heat from the dryer\n* Coconut oil: hydrates, shines, and has a coconut scent\n* Moroccan oil: hydrates, shines, and softens hair, as well as adding shine. Rich in **vitamins** and **antioxidants**\n\n3 Comb your hair.\n\n* Preferably, using a wide-tooth comb at first, then a fine tooth comb. Using a fine tooth comb first on wet hair before its general shape has been established can slightly damage hair due to the yanking motion from moving the heavy, wet hair so forcefully.\n* Comb the top part of your hair back (slick back), to the side (comb-over), or a combination of these two. This creates volume, which is a very desirable feature in good hair.\n* Comb the sides behind your ears or straight down against your head. Don’t generate volume on the sides.\n* Comb the back flat against your head. Don’t generate volume in the back.\n\n4 Use a hair dryer and a comb (or a **hair styler**) to dry your hair. **Comb it and dry it at the same time in the same direction.**\n\n* Use medium heat\n* Dry it in the direction that you combed it.\n* Comb it as you dry it. (the most vital step)\n* Dry your hair abiding by this technique until it is about 90% or 100% dry.\n\n5 Dry and comb your hair again with the *cool* setting.\n\n* The cool air contracts the pores. This “locks” your hair in place.\n\n**PRODUCT**\n\nIf your hair has been dried correctly, your hair should have a definite shape with lots of volume on top. The hair should keep its hold reasonably well. Adding product is the final step to preserve how long your hair remains in this state. Products also exemplify your hair’s texture, shine, and shape.\n\n1 Select a product\n\n* Creams: flexible, looser substances that provide a more natural, loose, and messy hold without adding much shine.\n* Gels: Keeps your hair stiff and shiny, but doesn’t add too much volume. Adding too much will make your hair *crunchy*\n* Pomades: appears as either a heavy white cream based or hard, clear gel based. Pomades possess a higher hold that adds volume and often adds high shine\n* Clays: Heavy, white, hard substance that adds volume with a *matte* finish\n\n2 Emulsify the product\n\n* In *Layman’s terms* that just means take a small amount and rub it into your hands until you can’t see it anymore\n* This ensures even distribution and prevents clumps\n* Use a dime or quarter sized amount\n\n3 Apply product to hair\n\n* Focus on the roots and sections with distinct partings. For example, if you have a comb over, focus most of the product on the actual part where the hair flips over\n* Add some under your bangs and go up\n* Emulsify more and repeat for each section of your hair\n* Don’t put much on the sides and back. Wipe off excess products there instead.\n* Push the sides and back flat against your head with the product\n\n4 Comb the hair again after the product is in your hair\n\n* Use your hands if you want a more *natural* look\n\nIn conclusion, these are the fundamentals of styling men’s hair that works with the vast majority of haircuts. Ideally, your haircut should be longer on the top, with *layers*, and *thinned out*, *tapered*, or *faded* at the back and sides to keep it proportional. Consult with your barber or stylist for the best looks. Also, although these steps may seem long and tedious, with practice you can achieve consistent, remarkable style in less than 10 minutes.\n\n* An even quicker, more compact version of these methods is to just wet your hair, dry it using proper techniques, then add product.\n\n* Check out [Alex Costa](https://youtu.be/-zlvkz9WDR8), [Alpha M](https://youtu.be/8irflrbt6k8), [Weston Boucher](https://youtu.be/LpQYUZEN5wk), and [Blu Maan](https://youtu.be/oVjXjvZKOrk) for excellent live examples to follow.",

Water and shampoo open your hair’s cuticle (basically the outsides of the strands of hair) and conditioner helps close it back up.

See Wikipedia 👀\n\nI don't know if it's been mentioned, but I would also recommend not using high heat on your hair as you're drying it except for maybe in the back... However, I'd recommend using warm if not cool air drying the top.\n\nHot hair dryer air not good particularly with thinning hair. Plus there's been a million, perhaps trillions of cases of people particularly women frying their hair. And some of that is mostly with a hot iron, but over the long haul I believe warm to cool air will save you a little If not a lot more hair if you will.\n\nAlso I would recommend only washing your hair 2-3 days a week...If that's a possibility and you don't have super unruly hair. \n\nI do have unruly hair / I'm French and German mostly, however have kind of Asian hair with a lot of cowlicks. And right now I'm working from home... And I usually just wet it put some Argan styling lotion/oil, then stick a cool/warm hair dryer to it and voila... a little product. I use Redken or Aveda typically a little mixture of grooming clay with a touch of pomade to give it a slight shine.\n\nMy $0.01 worth \n\nGood stuff OP!",

It also helps condition the hair too; I've noticed a vast improvement in the health of my hair since I've started using them.\n\nHere's the best ones I've discovered for my hair type:\n\n* Almond Sweet Oil\n* Macadamia Nut Oil\n* Marula Oil\n* Jojoba Oil\n\nThere are others (Argan, Castor etc etc) but I've found the above best for my hair type.\n\nI've also found it's way cheaper to buy the oils in their pure form from Amazon or somewhere as opposed to buying a branded product that either contain loads of added chemicals or are just super overpriced for what you get. For example, a 500ml bottle of Almond Sweet oil was like £5, whereas buying a small bottle of, say, Bluuman's Cloud Control, would set you back around £20.\n\nDepending on hair thickness, use just a few drops (I have to use literally loads as my hair just soaks it up) and use it as a pre-blow dry or just let to dry naturally and brush if necessary.\n\nI often combine them and make a hot oil hair mask which I leave in for a few hours and wash out for a deep treatment.\n\nHope this helps!",

    "body": "For a year or two my hair started falling out like crazy. I did all my research and spent so much money on fancy hair products including  thinning shampoos and conditioners (such as Nioxin) but nothing really helped. I was on so many subreddits, and posted about it on my other account. I went from losing one or two strands in the shower to having a designated area where I would collect hair balls to throw out after every shower. I started to see my scalp especially when my hair was a little dirty in a ponytail. The amount of hair I was losing was very concerning and very abnormal for me. I went for my yearly physical checkup (I go yearly but I guess I skipped a year) and my blood work said low vitamin D. At the same time I got a bad covid haircut so started taking biotin to help it grow out in addition to tons of Vitamin D.... literally in 3 weeks, I stopped losing hair!!!! Genetically I don’t absorb vitamin D well so I’m always slightly low around 29 but this time it was 24, which was much lower than usual. I was also taking some vitamin D but sporadically so I think at my worst, it was even lower than 24! The only thing I changed was how much vitamin D I was taking but I do think biotin may have helped some! I was taking biotin and collagen before but not consistently. I hope this will help someone also struggling with hair loss! \n\n\nTLDR - Hair started falling out like crazy for a year or 2. Blood work showed low vitamin D. Once I started taking vitamin d daily in combination with biotin, I stopped losing hair!!!\n\nEdit - Thank you for my very first award! :)\n\nEdit - 1+ year later (August 2022). I’ve had a number of people reach out for updates so thought I’d share here as well. So my hair had gotten great and no issue at all so eventually I got lazy and stopped taking vitamin D all together. This past spring/summer I didn’t go outside and lived almost a completely nocturnal life because I was working and then prepping for a certification exam. My hair started falling out like crazy again, like cleaning out my hair catcher midway through the shower so it can drain plus I would gather hair from my hands and walls and roll them up into BALLs after each shower. It was getting ridiculous. I just started taking gummies here and there (not everyday) but I’m already seeing great improvements! Like noticeable improvement… no more shower walls covered in hair to ball up and I don’t have to clean the drain midway through shower. It is still improving not back to perfect yet but it’s getting there. I guess I may be more sensitive to vitamin D levels but it also confirms that my hair loss is related to it. I’ve gone through smaller cycles of taking and not taking, and there is 100 percent a pattern for me. \n\nAlso someone commented that lower back pain can be caused by low Vitamin D as well. I never knew that but I honestly for me, it would totally explain everything especially the flare ups. I had terrible lower back pain for no apparent reason that eventually just randomly went away and the timeline of my hair loss and back pains strongly correlates! Obviously I have no idea if it was the cause and could be just confirmation bias, but it just fits so perfectly in my timeline like a puzzle piece. Thought I’d share since I don’t think this commonly known.\n\nPlease note this is just one anecdote and my personal experience. Everyone is different and there are many causes of hair loss. Some people with very low vitamin D may not even experience the same symptoms as me. Like I don’t get depressed unless I’m unaware of it and confuse it with apathy/anxiety and being lethargic exasperated by Adderall but overall I’m consistently pretty content. Just because this worked for me, it may not be the case for everyone. I do hope that this does help at least one person or encourages people to get their blood work done. Don’t self medicate because you can overdo it and always follow your doctor’s recommendations. If you have the opportunity go to your yearly checkups and make sure you are in good health in general. (I’m long overdue for a checkup and no, I have not tested since this post due to high stress work environment)",

Magnesium insufficiency exacerbates vitamin d insufficiency. Enzymes that metabolize vitamin D need magnesium to work. ([source](http://cardiacos.net/wp-content/uploads/ArticulosMedicos/20180722/2018---Role-of-Magnesium-in-Vitamin-D-Activation-and-Function.pdf))\n\n\\- Vitamin D is fat soluble so taking vitamin D with a meal containing fat will increase absorption. ([source](https://www.medicaldaily.com/vitamin-d-benefits-are-enhanced-if-meal-contains-fat-absorbing-more-supplements-311248))\n\n\\- Vitamin D is stored in body fat. Higher intakes of vitamin D are recommended for those with high % bodyfat and high BMI. ([source](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111265))",

I also started making fresh Kale and Collard Green smoothies along with taking 5000UI of Biotin, and a minimum of 1litre of water everyday.\n\nBut here's was the thing, my hair would grow in nicely like weeds, however after a few weeks my density went away and I could see hair falling everywhere and especially on my pillow. So essentially, my hair would grow in and then shed.\n\nI finally did a shit ton of research in a panic, as I couldn't go to the doctor cuz of stupid COVID. So I came across Vitamin D and reading how it can effect hair if you're not getting enough sun etc..Which btw for the past several months I've been pretty much locked in my house.\n\nAnyways, so I started taking 2000UI everyday, but within literally 1 Week my hair stopped falling out! I couldn't believe it y'all. My pillow and bedsheets are clean, no hairs anywhere, I am still gonna continue my healthy eating diet though, I'll only have Junk food once maybe every two months.

Then, i stumble upon a saying somewhere on reddit \"if it's worth doing, it's worth doing poorly\". If you can't brush your teeth daily, do it every other day or when you can, or even swish with water before going to bed is still doing something and better than doing nothing. Perfectionism is the enemy of progress.\nInspired by the saying, I created a tray of \"depression skincare\" that I leave on my bedside for easy access. The tray consists of all the basic stuff that is convenient and requires very little effort, so on the day in which I can't bring myself to get out of bed and get to the sink, I can still at least doing something while lying down. \n\nHere are the list of stuff I have on my tray:\n\n* Micellar water & cotton pads - so I can just wipe my face clean and leave it at that, no rinse needed.\n* Coconut oil - I use this for oil pulling on days I can't bother to brush my teeth, the liquid form helps with making it easy to just sip from the bottle.\n* Moisturizer face spray - when I don't feel like using moisturizer, a quick spray to my face requires no effort and is better than nothing. \n* Cooling Eye mask - this is mostly to cool my eyes after a good cry so I can be presentable for work the next day 😂\n* Mirror - looking at the mirror helps me try to realize how terrible I look so I don't neglect it further.\n* Tissues - no explanation needed.\n* Hairband - putting on hairband helps initiate the first step and ease me into the process of going to the sink and actually perform my hygiene and skincare. If not, it can at least help with putting on moisture easier.\n* Antibiotic ointment similar to Neosporin -  I pick at my face and acne when I'm anxious, so having these helps with quick healing and prevents infection. \n* Biotin in candy form - any bit helps, especially when it's sweet ! \n\nPhoto is taken with the tray on my bed, in keeping up with the spirit of depression day.",

I’ve been using topical finasteride and minoxidil for 3 months and I haven’t seen a difference at all. I supplement with vitamin C, vitamin D, and biotin and I get more than enough iron and b12 from my diet. Trying to convince my doctor to prescribe oral dutasteride but he’s extremely hesitant, going to try RU-58841 topically as well. I had cancer and went through chemo and radiation to kill it and eventually had a tumour in my left iliac crest removed, this has caused chronic back pain and slight laboured breathing, wondering if that could increase the rate my hair is falling out. This has been driving me crazy and girls aren’t even dtf unless I keep a ball cap on until we hit the bedroom. Is there something I’m missing, pharmaceutical or otherwise, should I just shave the shit off at this point or is it recoverable?",

Just buzz it off.\n\nStep 2- fuck the topical finasteride and go for oral. Topical has systemic absorption of about 50-60% unless your fin concentration is very, very low, like 0.0025%. Oral Fin reduces serum dht by 70-73%, so if you have no sides with your topical. Just get oral.\n\nStep 3- With the amount of hair loss you have had on your crown and temples, dont expect a complete regrowth. Because you won't. Use derma stamps and minox along with oral fin. Stabilise your hairfall and evaluate how much you have regrown within the next 2 years at least.\n\nStep 4- Once stabilised and you have had possible regrowth, go for a hair transplant when you can afford it or if you feel you need it.\n\nEdit: You're a good-looking dude. im sure you would rock the buzz cut. You are a real g for defeating cancer and really happy to hear it. I hope you have a successful hair journey and life ahead of you.\n\nGood luck.",

    "body": "I’ll cut straight to it - 45 yr old male, I started small crown loses along with receding hairline since about 30. \nI went to a v reputable HT consultant here in the UK last Nov, but he recommended not HT, but Fin/Min (which I’d never heard of) first to see how I responded. After a false start in November where my face went red and blotchy/dry, I tried again start of Jan. Surprised to find no symptoms second time around, so continued - TFFT!\nSince learning about Fin/Min I ended up here and have been reading a lot to see what people are doing but my rough process is:\n\n•Topical Fin 0.1% - Min 5% in TrichoSol, 1ml twice a day. (.5ml front and back)\n•Derma stamp 1.5mm, once morning a week (instead of topical)\nAfter about 6 weeks or so I moved to 1.75mm and did it immediately before topical about 4/7 mornings a week (controversial here I know)\n\nTwice a week or so I would do the topical early evening and later before bed apply liberal amounts of Rosemary & Castor oil and go to bed with it wrapped in a towel.\nAs it’s getting warmer now and just because of the effort, I’ve not bothered with this as much. No clue to the value, and I know others here have a similar opinion. \n\nDaily:\n\t•Biotin supplements, 5000ųg(contains copper and zinc)\n\t•Cod Liver Oil and multivitamins\n\t•Tumeric, inc Boswelia & Ginger\n\nI think that’s about it, I’m now on week 16 or so and to say I’m pleased with the results would be an understatement. I’m not sure I had the balls to go through with a HT, but I’m glad I went for the consult. I know the photos are a different angle/lighting, but even so I think it’s clear of the recovery. The consultant was 2 weeks after a haircut, and the new pics are the day after a haircut, so a lot shorter, which is also quite telling. Thanks.  \n",

    "body": "I feel like I see an iteration of this exact same post every day or so on this sub, so I thought I’d offer a (long but) simple explanation for why your perfectly healthy hair can’t seem to grow past a certain length, no matter how well you care for it.\n\nThe explanation is this: each hair strand, from each little follicle, only grows for a certain amount of time.  Not to a certain length, not until the hair strand weighs a certain amount (??), but for a certain, specific amount of time.  The maximum length that a person’s hair can reach is equal to the maximum amount of hair length that their follicles produce per month multiplied by the maximum number of months that their hair will produce more length. After that, the follicle pauses growth, sheds the old strand, rests for a bit, and begins producing hair again. \n\nIf you had, say, shoulder-length hair, and your goal is to grow it to waist length, then you need to grow a foot or so of hair, depending on your height, to achieve your goal.  (I’m going to use some nice round numbers here because it’s all individual anyway and I’m not getting up to get a measuring tape or a calculator.) So, you start your hair growth journey: you’re taking your vitamins, oiling your hair, assessing your shampoo and conditioner choices. You learn a few braids, learn about dusting and micro-trimming.  You wash your hair less often, then a little more often.  You own a silk pillowcase.  There’s rosemary oil everywhere. \n\nLet’s say that your hair grows, on average, 0.5”/month (because that makes the math easy). Let’s also say that you have a hair trimmer angel whom you trust implicitly: this sainted angel trims exactly 0.5” from your hair every six months because that’s all that’s necessary to keep it healthy because you’re taking such great care of it. \n\nBy this math, you should have healthy, lush waist length hair in a little less than 2.5 years, right?  0.5” x 30 months = 15” of growth – 2.5” trimmed = 12.5” of growth from shoulder length. \n\nSo why is your hair stuck around your mid-back, and why does it look so scraggly/thin/”unhealthy”? You took the vitamins.  You did all the rosemary oil.  You did hair masks.  You’re rinsing in cold water, where are the promised mermaid waves?? Are you just cursed with terrible genetics, doomed to return, shorn and dejected, to bob-land?\n\nActually, no, you are probably not cursed with terrible genetics.  You are probably not doing anything wrong, especially if you’ve been taking diligent care of your hair for 2.5 years.  \n\nHere’s the thing: Each of those strands that you’ve been oiling and babying has already been growing for its own individual length of time.  A blunt shoulder-length haircut includes strands at full length that are about two years old, give or take, and it could also include strands that have been growing for 5-7 years on the outside end of the range, that you’ve been trimming to shoulder length the entire time.  When you decide to grow out shoulder length hair, those older strands are still going to shed in their natural time.  They will never get as long as they would have, had they never been trimmed.  This means that, as some strands shed and others keep growing, the ends of your hair will naturally become thinner. \n\nYou can tell if you’re in this scraggly situation if you look at the ends of your hair and see that you’re losing considerable density toward the end, but the individual strands aren’t split, broken or otherwise unhealthy. \n\nAnd here’s the hard pill to swallow for those among us who want the fastest path possible to long, thick, healthy hair, emphasis on the LONG: the length of time that it will take for your hair to get both longer AND thicker with a full, juicy hemline is the length of time that it takes for your old, trimmed hair strands to shed, and then for all of your new-growth strands to sprout and travel down the growth path to your desired length.  Unfortunately, more and more strands will age while those new growth strands are traveling down your back, and then THEY will shed, and those follicles will start their own fresh new sprouts which will join the growth journey, etc., etc., and so goes the circle of life. \n\nThis fact is both comforting and frustrating.  Your hair isn’t unhealthy.  It's not breakage.  Biotin or folic acid won’t fix it.  Hair just naturally sheds, and if you’ve already trimmed three years of growth off of a hair strand, that strand is going to shed before it reaches the length that would have been its full potential length, had it not been trimmed.  Multiply this by the number of hairs that you have on your head that have been trimmed, and you can see why it’s going to take longer to grow long hair than it seems like it should take: you have to, essentially, give every trimmed hair the chance to shed, and then regrow with the minimum amount of trimming necessary to keep it healthy, to reach its full potential length and thickness. \n\nFortunately! Your hair will eventually get both longer and thicker.  It just takes time, probably more time than you think.  I think part of the frustration that people experience with their hair growth journeys is unrealistic expectations, either based on mis-information or on hair success stories from people with completely different heads of hair.\n\nFor the sake of a quick reality check, here are some factors that are going to mean that natural shedding has a much lower impact on someone’s hair growth journey:\n\n1)    They’re short.  A 5’ tall person’s hair doesn’t have to grow for as long a time to reach their waist as a 6’ tall person’s hair.\n\n2)    Their natural hair growth cycle is longer.\n\n3)    Their natural hair growth cycle is faster.\n\n4)    Their hair strands are thicker and/or they have greater hair density. \n\n5)    They have virgin, undyed, unbleached hair.  (I know this is a touchy subject, so I’m not going to go into it too much.  I’m not saying that it’s impossible to grow long hair and also use dye or bleach; I’m saying that mistakes can be made, care must be taken, and the growth journey will require some extra TLC.)\n\nIf any of those factors apply to you, you already know about it, I promise, no matter where you are in your hair growth journey.  If they don’t, then you’re probably already aware of that as well.  It doesn’t mean that there’s anything wrong with you, or that you’re making mistakes.  Frustratingly, it also doesn’t mean that there’s any action you can take or anything for you to fix.  It just means that you’ve got normal, ordinary, healthy hair that you’re taking great care of, that’s taking it’s sweet, genetic time to grow. \n\nAll of this is assuming that your health is relatively intact, your diet is ok, you and your doctor have your blood work under control, your hormones aren’t going through anything wonky, you’re not over-trimming, and you are, in fact, taking very good care of your hair, including regular protective hairstyles and not using bleach. \n\nSo what do you do if you just want long, healthy hair??\n\nAs in most cases, you get to choose from imperfect choices.  Think of it this way: you can have hair long, thick and quick, but you can only pick two.  If you want thicker hair quickly, chop it: you’ll have lush blunt ends in no time.  If you want long hair as quickly as possible, accept that it may be long, but it’s going to be thinner than it could be.  If you want long, thick hair, then settle in because that process isn’t quick. \n\nIt's not a one-size-fits-all, but I can share my personal situation for context. In September 2017 I got a 1” pixie cut.  Glad I tried it, not for me, started growing it out almost immediately.\n\n* Necessary context: I’m 5’8”, hair is medium density, thick strands, and it’s relatively strong and healthy.  It gets dry, but I’m not prone to split ends or breakage.  No dye or bleach. My hair grows an average of a little over 0.5”/month.\n* For two years, I trimmed the teensiest bit possible just for shape.  Otherwise I found ways to style it back and out of my way.\n* 2019 I trimmed an inch to even it out. The front still had some shorter parts, but it looked like a shoulder-length haircut. I started French braiding it daily at this point.\n* Not sure I trimmed it in 2020.  That was a weird year.\n* 2021 I trimmed maybe 2 inches over the course of the year. \n* By mid-2022 my hair was waist-length.  It was healthy, no split ends, but looking at pictures of it from the back, I could see that it wasn’t as dense toward the hemline. Small trims ensued. \n* I’ve maintained my hair length somewhere between waist and hip since that time, trimming here and there, with the goal of thickening my length all the way down.  Based on my average growth rate, it looks like I’ve got another year or so to go before my hair is fully thick to my hips. \n\nHere’s my $0.02 worth of advice, for exactly what it’s worth: baby your hair, grow it out to a length that’s longer, if not quite your goal length, and then let it rest at that length for a bit, trimming the ends, to give some more of your strands time to catch up. Then grow a little more, and then again rest and trim.  It’s a compromise.  It will take a little longer to reach your goal length, but you’ll probably enjoy the journey more.  If you grow it as fast as you possibly can, you run the risk of arriving at your goal length and deciding that long hair doesn’t suit you because it grows badly, gets thin, etc., when in reality your strands just needed a little more time to reach your goal together. \n\nOn the flip side, if you cave to reddit pressure and trim your perfectly healthy ends every time this sub declares hair with thinner ends to be scraggly, unhealthy, gross, unhygienic, “it looks damaged,” or whatever other judgy term we’re using these days to describe what may actually be perfectly healthy hair that’s just in an uneven stage of its growth process (<- all examples that I’ve seen, and sorry, this kind of judgmental commentary really bothers me), you risk taking far longer than necessary to reach your goal length.  I’ve seen several posts recently that look like Hair Hypochondria: there’s nothing wrong with the person’s hair, but they’re posting pictures asking how much to trim because the internet has convinced them that hair that varies in thickness down the length is “ugly.” \n\nOh, and learn to braid.  That really is my best hair growth tip.\n\nYour hair isn’t ugly.  It’s growing.  Keep taking care of it, oil it or wash it as you like, enjoy the hell out of that silk pillow case.  I just wanted to reassure everyone that your hair probably *can* grow longer than you think it can; it’s just going to take a lot longer than you think it will.   \n\n  \nEdit: stupid formatting",

People ask me about my hair (tailbone length) and I can send them my full list of current products all they want but without understanding this right here, it probably won’t go as they expect. I bleached, dyed and trimmed my ends last year in April and it’s still grown to where it is now. That’s because I’ve been doing lots of TLC and constantly checking for split ends and snipping them when I see them. It takes a lot of time to grow out hair and I recently went and got a trim so they could get a majority of my splits taken care of for me. I’m still here at home checking religiously and snipping any I see that were missed. I also put my hair in a loose braid with a satin scrunchie and a satin bonnet for bed. Not just to protect my hair but because this also protects my face from any products in my hair that can cause an acne flair up. During the day I keep it in a loose braid with a satin scrunchie to prevent any unnecessary breakage (I’m in college for welding & photography) and tuck it away. Patience and protective hairstyles for the win. 🥇",

What is a good technique or even a plan of attack when washing your long hair? Every time I wash mine it gets insanely tangled and when I detangle it with my fingers I end up with a ton of shed hair. I’m afraid I’m losing more than I should, like it’s breaking and not just natural shedding but can never tell when I look at the ends if it broke or not. So, is there a plan of attack that you use or like do you find washing you hair/scalp in a circular motion to tangle more of less? Maybe you put the top section in a claw clip while you wash the rest? I don’t know… I asked my stylist (yes I do have to have regular hair trims and coloring for my exceptionally conservative job) and he said it shouldn’t be an issue but something is up bc when he does it there aren’t any tangles. What the heck am I doing wrong?",

I am so afraid for him.\n\nTwo weeks ago I was holding him as he sobbed on the bathroom floor, and he told me he's giving this one more year. That he doesn't want to feel like this anymore. \n\nI'm watching him waste away. He says every day that he feels like a 90 year old man. Getting off the couch is tough for him most days. If he can find a bout of energy for a very small home workout, he's trashed for days after. He no longer does any of the things he used to love like hiking, biking, or working out at the gym. He can't walk the dogs, and can barely check the mail. He's surviving currently on turkey, fruit, and vegetables with basically no fat, because he feels sick if he eats anything else.  I am positively convinced he is dying, but I could never tell him that, because  my hope is the only thing keeping him going. I keep telling him he's going to be okay, that we will figure it out, but I just don't know anymore.\n\n  \n**We need help. I need your help. Please help us.**  \n\n\n**I am willing to listen to anything anyone has to say, answer any and all questions we can, get further testing, or see further specialists.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband began to feel ill just over 5 years ago. Since then his health has been in steady decline. \n\nPatient: \n\n40 year old male  \n5'11  \nCaucasian  \nPreviously a powerlifter  \nTook a regular low dose (his words) of anabolic steroids for approximately 10 years, quitting cold turkey in 2015.   \nPreviously ate a TERRIBLE diet (carbo loading as part of workout regimen), but stopped that in 2015, and was also vegan for about a year in 2019. Currently eats very healthy- daily fruits/veggies, NO fast food, fried food, and little to no processed food. (what is processed is basically just grain free crackers)  \nAppendectomy in 2015, first bout of pancreatitis the very next week.  \nChildhood asthma which was resolved until 2017  \nAllergy to Penicillin and amoxicillin (as told by his mother)  \nOne previous blood clot in leg (prior to 2013, but do not know the date or specifics)  \nRecovering alcoholic who has not had alcohol since he was 21. (I am 100% positive he has had none since we met, but happy to explain further)  \nWeight in 2015 was around 215 lbs, weight at beginning of decline in health was around 185, current weight around 155 lbs.  \nUp to, and into 2017 he was working out (lifting-heavy) approximately 10 hours per week, now only an occasional light dumbbell workout at home.  \nHistory of finicky sleep, but nothing like it is now  \nSome history of bowel issues, which seem to occur and resolve repeatedly over years, and may not be related to a health problem.  \n\\[May or may not be related, but years ago he did develop a large white patch on his head seen here [https://imgur.com/a/jQInUur](https://imgur.com/a/jQInUur) although it does not seem to have changed since then, nor have others appeared\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nCurrently taking:\n\nOccasional modafinil to help with brain fog for work, but he does not take a full dose, nor take it regularly.  \nCoffee enemas daily (only thing that seems to help at all)\n\nIn the past he has taken a great many supplements and medications to try to find a cure for this illness. Those include Alpha blockers, trazadone, clonazepam, RLS medication (Can't recall the name) saw palmetto, bacopa, gotu kola, st. john's wart, valerian, melatonin, benadryl, probiotics, prebiotics, iodine, colloidal silver, vitamins (you name it he's probably tried it), passionflower, lemon balm, catnip, and chamomile. Certainly there are more.\n\nHe has tried dietary changes many times over the years also. He's been vegan, vegetarian, low fodmap, low amylose, paleo, and lectin free. He's done exclusionary diets many times, and we have not been able to pinpoint a cause that is specifically food related. (He does not do well with Cauliflower, Eggplant or avocado oil, though.)  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\[\\[Illness begins around June 2017, these earlier results are included for informational purposes\\]\\]**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EARLIER RESULTS:**\n\n**10/10/2013**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Rh9B45Y](https://imgur.com/a/Rh9B45Y)\n\nDUAP CBC W/DIFF \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/a35Xbop](https://imgur.com/a/a35Xbop)\n\nComprehensive metabolic panel\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/ONDQC3v](https://imgur.com/a/ONDQC3v)\n\nLipid Panel Direct Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) Cholesterol\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**03/31/2014**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/FNrTXBc](https://imgur.com/a/FNrTXBc)\n\nH Pylori C Breath Test\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2/10/2015**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/H92mubo](https://imgur.com/a/H92mubo)\n\nLipase\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/rBPvGkA](https://imgur.com/a/rBPvGkA)\n\nComprehensive Metabolic Panel\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6/05/2015**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/c1jYiar](https://imgur.com/a/c1jYiar)\n\nCreatinine\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/tYHnKVl](https://imgur.com/a/tYHnKVl)\n\nIGG SUBCLASSES, SERUM\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Hx7CY1X](https://imgur.com/a/Hx7CY1X)\n\nLipase\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/AidL36e](https://imgur.com/a/AidL36e)\n\nAmylase\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RH0gmCx](https://imgur.com/a/RH0gmCx)\n\nLipid panel\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6/15/2015**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/nzArUox](https://imgur.com/a/nzArUox)\n\nAbdominal MRI\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\[\\[ BEGINS TO EXPERIENCE MOST SYMPTOMS FROM THIS DATE\\]\\]**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn early 2017 my husband and I moved from New England, to New Mexico. \n\nThe day before we moved, he found four embedded ticks on his thighs. We do not know how long they had been attached. (He was later tested for tickborne diseases, twice. Both were negative) \n\nIn NM, we rented a home and beginning a few months after we moved in, he began to notice some strange symptoms, but nothing too alarming. \n\nHis first biggest symptom was lack of sleep. He would wake up after a few hours, and not be able to get back to sleep. If he did manage, he'd still wake feeling very unrested in the morning. He felt very fatigued, and we attributed this to lack of sleep. \n\nHis doctor ran tests but said he found no reason for his fatigue and sleeplessness, and referred him for a sleep study.   \nHe did diagnose him with an enlarged prostate, and some sort of bacterial infection of either the bladder or prostate (We cannot recall which) and put him on a long dose of CIPRO. He was taking that for quite a while (perhaps a month) when he began to notice his ankles hurting. At that time, the doctor took him off of CIPRO. I believe he replaced it with another antibiotic, and in total he was on an antibiotic for probably 3 months (as best we can recall).  \nThis same doctor's office also tried Alpha blockers (to stop nightmares?), clonazepam, trazadone, and a medication for restless leg syndrome.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the sleep study, he was incorrectly diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea. He used a CPAP nightly for close to a year before another sleep study  revealed the first diagnosis was incorrect, and he had no apnea (central, nor obstructive- we were at higher altitude)\n\nHe also saw a cardiologist during this time, due to him having heart palpitations.  They fitted him with a holter monitor. Due to an error in the office (we lived remotely and it was an issue with the cell carrier the monitors used) only about an hour of data was collected. They did say that the data showed no cause for concern, though.\n\nHe visited an ENT (thinking breathing problems may be causing sleep disturbances) and they ran a scope way up in his face. They told him he had roughly 90% blockage due to deviated septum. \n\nHe had surgery to repair this, but it did not improve his symptoms.  \nThe end also ran a test for skin allergies, showing he was highly reactive to dust mites, but not much else from their test panel.\n\nDuring this time my husband also militantly tried sleep hygiene (about 3 months) but it did not help.  \nHe also tried cutting screen time 3 hours before bed, as well as a cutoff for eating and drinking.\n\n**06/19/2017**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/TZUSt5M](https://imgur.com/a/TZUSt5M)\n\nLipid Panel+\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Oc06Nz6](https://imgur.com/a/Oc06Nz6)\n\nCBC w/ Diff/Platelets+\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Bgx2w7C](https://imgur.com/a/Bgx2w7C)\n\nComprehensive Metabolic Panel+\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/B9NOcjy](https://imgur.com/a/B9NOcjy)\n\nBorrelia burgdorferi Ab (Lyme), Total by ELISA, Reflex to IgG & IgM by Western blot (Acute)+\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Zzqatjc](https://imgur.com/a/Zzqatjc)\n\nPSA, Serum+\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/EicHkwR](https://imgur.com/a/EicHkwR)\n\nUA Dip w/o micro +\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/sLkxZyT](https://imgur.com/a/sLkxZyT)\n\nUrine culture\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**11/26/2018**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/0LV9Ix2](https://imgur.com/a/0LV9Ix2)\n\nCBC w/ Diff/Platelets+\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/H2BAj2G](https://imgur.com/a/H2BAj2G)\n\nComprehensive Metabolic Panel+\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/wDTeJnN](https://imgur.com/a/wDTeJnN)\n\nFerritin+\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/qce4FNr](https://imgur.com/a/qce4FNr)\n\nBorrelia burgdorferi Ab (Lyme), IgG and/or IgM by ELISA with Reflex to IgG by Western Blot (Late Disease)+\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/xDRSbwc](https://imgur.com/a/xDRSbwc)\n\nRheumatoid Factor+\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/I8u21vC](https://imgur.com/a/I8u21vC)\n\nTSH W/ FREE T4+\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**12/03/2018**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/1GGjeHf](https://imgur.com/a/1GGjeHf)\n\nHIV ABS W/ CONF SCREEN\\*\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/9Qs6W9M](https://imgur.com/a/9Qs6W9M)\n\nBABESIA MICROTI ANTIBODY PANEL\\*\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/cNykvMu](https://imgur.com/a/cNykvMu)\n\nEHRLICHIA DETECTION PCR\\*\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/QTUtNX7](https://imgur.com/a/QTUtNX7)\n\nESR (SED RATE) Westergren\\*\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/16WYTHi](https://imgur.com/a/16WYTHi)\n\nVITAMIN B12\\*\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/XEHn0WG](https://imgur.com/a/XEHn0WG)\n\nFEBRILE Ab PROFILE\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**05/29/2019**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/26nbBOy](https://imgur.com/a/26nbBOy)\n\nVITAMIN B12 AND FOLATE\\*\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/vforvFx](https://imgur.com/a/vforvFx)\n\nTSH W/ FREE T4\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy 2020, his symptoms were documented as follows:\n\nInsomnia  \nFatigue (extreme)  \nBody aches  \nWeakness  \nHeadaches, with sensitivity to light  \nMemory impairment  \nDifficulty concentrating/ brain fog  \nStiffness and joint pain  \nShortness of breath  \nHeart palpitations  \nDifficulty regulating body temperature  \nBlurred vision  \nNight sweats  \nMood swings  \nAbdominal pain  \nVertigo  \nRecurrance of childhood asthma\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe discovered that mold illness can cause most of these symptoms, and so found a doctor who specializes in mold and follows the Shoemaker protocol. He ran many tests, including a genetic test. He said roughly 25% of the population has a genetic problem that makes it so their bodies cannot rid themselves of mycotoxins, and that my husband was part of that group. (lab attached)\n\nHe prescribed clay binders, and moving. We did both.\n\nWe took a precious few belongings with us when we left, and then only hard items that could easily be cleaned. All soft goods like clothing, and pillows, etc were discarded.\n\n  \nAfter moving, most of the acute symptoms died down dramatically, leading us to believe this was the cause of his problems, and he would slowly improve over time, like his mold doctor said. \n\nHe stopped experiencing the headaches and light sensitivity almost immediately, along with the stiffness and joint pain, blurred vision, night sweats, and the worst of the mood swings. He also stopped needing to use his inhaler daily.  However, now 3 years later, he has not improved further, and has developed other symptoms, and some existing ones are worsening.\n\n \n\n**2/25/2020**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/ddvd6K4](https://imgur.com/a/ddvd6K4) genetic\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2/25/2020**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/scqt0o3](https://imgur.com/a/scqt0o3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3/04/2020**\n\nEnvirobiomics mold test in our rental home\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/nYRallL](https://imgur.com/a/nYRallL)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**11/16/2020**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/2P2cGym](https://imgur.com/a/2P2cGym)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the beginning of 2021 we moved again, out of state. He visited another cardiologist, who did an EKG (although most of the leads were not touching his skin due to body hair they did not shave) for his heart palpitations, and said he was fine. They too fitted him for a holter for 24 hours. It took roughly 4 months to get the results, but they said there were no concerning findings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn 2022, his pancreatitis has flared up multiple times, and he has seen a few more doctors, including a GI. The GI has done many blood tests, and also did an endoscopic ultrasound. The findings were that there was minor flattening of the duodenum, but the doctor said (over the phone) that he saw no evidence of celiac disease, pancreatic, or stomach cancer or ulcers.   \nThe pancreatitis is now chronic, and most foods (unless they pretty much have zero fat, and still even then sometimes) cause him abdominal discomfort. He has pain in his stomach area, and into his back. This is often accompanied by abdominal bloating, belching, and passing gas. There are times when eating or drinking causes these symptoms, and other times where eating or drinking relieves them. It makes no sense.  \n\n\nHe also had an infected dental crown removed in early 2022, and was placed on antibiotics. He developed C-Diff, and was treated. The GI did a test to confirm it was gone, and told us that he needs to be taking a certain brand of both probiotics and fiber (benefiber, specifically), although he was already taking another brand of both.\n\n**4/19/2022**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/NA0BtUx](https://imgur.com/a/NA0BtUx)\n\nIron, TIBC, and Ferritin panel\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5/25/2022**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/poHFM9h](https://imgur.com/a/poHFM9h)\n\nComprehensive Metabolic Panel\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe began to wonder about his previously infected dental crown. The dentist had removed that, and the tooth, and put in a bone graft. We started researching more on that, and found it plausible that he had other infection in his mouth which could be causing problems, perhaps having spread from the initial crown. We found a dentist who specializes in that type of thing. He had the bone graft removed, as well as another crown removed (which was also apparently infected) and they cleaned out (I think) two wisdom teeth cavitations. They sent in samples for testing. \n\nIt's worth noting that he did not have this work done on the opposite side of his mouth, so if there is infection there somewhere we do not know.\n\n**Dental**\n\n**6/23/2022**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/xITsXzh](https://imgur.com/a/xITsXzh)\n\nDental DNA \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5/24/2022**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/AD3QUYA](https://imgur.com/a/AD3QUYA)\n\nDental vitamin D \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**07/28/2022**  \n(GI doc again)\n\n[https://imgur.com/yiCOhMn](https://imgur.com/yiCOhMn)\n\nComprehensive Metabolic Panel\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe recently discovered we are able to order some tests ourselves through a third party, and have them processed at Labcorp or Quest. We tested for Lead poisoning, and toxoplasmosis. Lead because we do use cast iron, and occasionally antique ones, and they can have an unknown history in smelting. Toxoplasmosis because we got our first cat right around the time this all started in 2017. \n\nI messed up though: I saw it said to discontinue Biotin 72 hours prior to this test. He did not take anything called Biotin, and we thought nothing of it. However today, after getting these last results, I looked more into it. Turns out his B complex vitamins he's taking do have a high dose of Biotin (and apparently makes his urine bright yellow). Also, he began coffee enemas two days before these labs were drawn.  \n I understand that this may skew some results, but I'm including these anyway, just in case. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**12/28/2022**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/JZLoMrD](https://imgur.com/a/JZLoMrD)\n\nLead  \nToxoplasmosis  \nHormone profile  \nACTH\n\n  \n \n\nFor the last year and a half we have been living in a brand new home (in yet another state), where we are the first occupants.

When he enters a place now that (probably) has mold, he begins to feel what he calls \"mold sweats\". IE acute symptoms immediately.

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin.

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

While you might have had a bad experience, using acids with retinol will NOT cause more breakouts as you erroneously suggested, and on the contrary many dermatologists recommend using benzoyl peroxide in conjunction with retinols to stave off purging and help acne heal faster. You can say be careful using acids, but speaking so definitively about something that is completely not true and unfounded (especially about it somehow causing more breakouts) is something that needs to be editing or removed.",

Like many, I lived in denial for years, hoping it would magically stop. Spoiler: it didn’t.  \n\nI initially focused on vitamins and supplements—biotin, zinc, iron, and vitamin D—and added hair-thickening shampoo to my routine. While these are a great baseline for overall health, they had *zero* impact on my hair loss.  \n\nIn February this year, I finally started Minoxidil (5%) and, to my surprise, began seeing small baby hairs growing. Around the same time, I had my testosterone checked and found it was *alarmingly* low. I started Enclomiphene to address this but made the mistake of taking Anavar (a DHT derivative) for 30 days(for gym gains), which led to significant shedding.  \n\nFrustrated but determined, I decided to go all in with a topical mix of Finasteride, Minoxidil, and Tretinoin. The results so far have been incredible—my hair is noticeably thickening, and I’ve got loads of baby hairs coming in. Side effects? Minimal. I experienced slightly watery sperm for about two weeks, but libido, erection quality, and cognitive function have all been unaffected.  \n\nThe progress has been exciting, and I’m finally seeing the results I hoped for after years of trial and error. To anyone on this journey: stay consistent, and don’t be afraid to experiment responsibly. You *can* turn things around.\n\n",

That might not sound like much, but for me, it’s huge.\n\nStill a long way to go, but I’m really seeing progress and feeling hopeful.

I’m now planning to add oral minoxidil (2.5mg) to my routine. I’ve also been using Nizoral and a dermaroller for about a year.

(and received quite some flack for that) So here we go with some photos to match the consultants’ in the clinic. (Even got out the DSLR to bring the quality up to theirs)\n\nTo recap - I went for a HT transplant consult in November 2024, but was advised to go down the fin/min route first to see if a HT was really necessary, and also to stop the rot now! There are drawing marks on me to show what could be done, but obviously didn’t go ahead after his suggestion of topical treatment.\n\nSo this is 4+ months of generic compounded topical fin/min, 0.5ml, front and back, twice a day. (0.1% Fin, 5% Min, in TrichoSol) Also done random dermastamping, sometimes daily, but now backed off to weekly, previously 1.75mm, more recently back to 0.8-1mm. Some odd evenings I’ve used rosemary oil instead of fin/min (some evenings I did the rosemary oil 30 mins after the min/min), biotin pills regularly. I had an initial skin reaction when I started in late nov/early dec, so stopped for around 4 weeks, then started properly in Jan.\n\nNothing to promote here, all cheap stuff. The generic compounding chemist only charges £44 per 6 weeks ($60-ish). The hair in my consultation photos is much longer which is the crazy thing, really pleased with the results so far. I’ve put some markers on the pics, just because of some of the doubt from the last post of it being the same person.\n\nThanks for those who’ve given advice on stuff, as I’ve used this community for all my intel!",

    "body": "Brief History: about 3 years ago I tried fin, but due to being extremely paranoid I stopped taking fin after only a month or so. Next I tried minoxidil but was extremely inconsistent with application so also did not see much progress. I noticed hair loss when I would say I was about 18-20. Receding hairline etc. 2024 was probably the most stressful year of my life which is why I believe the loss accelerated pretty bad this past year. \n\nNow: currently I am now 24 years old, and using topical 0.3% fin & 6% min spray from (redacted) (keeping brand name out of this post so no one thinks it’s an ad but I am sure you can assume where I got it from). I apply the spray as directed once a night and have not missed a single day since beginning treatment. I dermaroll 2x per week and use Nizoral shampoo 2x per week. Not sure if there is any research or scientific data about this but I set it up where I would dermaroll after using shampoo in the shower, I did this to avoid any build up getting “pushed” deeper into my scalp, idk lol. I began this regimen on 11/13/24. \n\nI think it also worth noting other aspects of my daily life that could possibly affect regrowth. My diet is extremely clean for the most part. Mostly single ingredient foods. I hit the gym 5-7 days a week. I take vitamin C, biotin, and elderberry gummies everyday but I doubt vitamins contribute.  \n\nSince beginning this regimen on 11/13/24 I experienced some extremely crazy shedding, more than I have ever experienced. I kept calm and just kept pushing, on 12/29/24 I noticed extremely less shedding, and since this day my shedding has been pretty minimal besides the normal amount of you were to go though your hair. I have not experienced any side effects, in terms of libido I almost feel like it has done the complete opposite of bringing it down thankfully.\n\nUpdate 1/9/25: I believe the increased libido was due to having more free time on my hands and just being bored. I am back to my regular schedule in terms of school, work, and my business so stress levels are up which I think has brought it back to normal. Still no sides.\n\nUpdate 2/12/25: definitely noticed my hair looks more full, first signs of regrowth, feels too good to be true! Will stick with it and give an update at the 6 month mark.\n\nAttached are photos \n\nTLDR:  topical 0.3% fin & 6% min spray + 2x dermaroll/week (Mon + Thurs) + 2x (Mon + Thurs) nizoral/week\n\nFeel free to leave any comments or questions! I’m not an expert on this stuff by any means but will try my best to help out! \n\n\n\n\nBe consistent! ",

Either way major come back! \n\nI experienced the same strong return of my crown on both oral and high topical fin but I get sides so I do low dose 0.025% topical fin my own custom made solution and it effectively maintains but I got my bald spot back just not worth any side effects",

    "body": "\nSo for background, I(F31) have been going to an aesthetician since 2021 for biotin and vit b12 injections every month, and facial rejuvenation treatment every 6 months. Last year, at my visit she told me they offer a new treatment “Russian lip filler” and told me a bit about it. I have naturally thick, plump lips but was super curious what they would look like with filler. We discussed it and I was persuaded so I got 0.5ml fillers. It was very painful and didn’t make much difference. \n\nSo, I met B(M28) in Feb, we got on well but my mum was severely sick from March to Aug so we didn’t really speak or hang out. We started talking again 2 months ago we’re now dating. Not official-official but going well.\n\nWhen we met, B complimented my lips and asked if I had filler and I said “no, all natural”. This was about 8 months after my treatment, so the filler had faded at this point. Also this was our opening conversation, so I didn’t feel it was necessary to share that I had had filler in the past. \n\n3 nights ago I get an email for my 6 month appointment and messaged my aesthetician to reschedule. B is beside me and asks what I’m doing and I explain. He’s asking about the cost and how often I get it done, then says that it’s a waste of money. He’s a financial advisor so I guess it’s his job to say things like this but I ask him to mind his business in a light hearted way. He’s still asking how many treatments I’ve had done and how much it has cost me in total. I’m annoyed but I scroll up to see what date I first message her and scroll past pictures of my lips swollen after having filler. He asks what they are and I explain I sent her a picture of my lips to ask if the swelling was normal. \n\nB gets angry and demands to know why I lied to him. I’m confused and say I didn’t lie about anything. He starts shouting that he specifically asked me if I had had filler and I straight up lied about it. I said I had only had filler once and it had been 8 months before I had even met him, the effects had already worn off and he didn’t ask me if I had EVER had filler. He had asked if my lips looked like this because of filler, which they don’t, because this is how they naturally look. He said it was a waste of money, I’m wasting money I should be spending on my kids on filling my lips with toxic crap and then lying about it. I asked him not to comment on how I spend my money. \n\nHe was so offended and angry. He said he couldn’t trust me cause if I’d lie about something small, I’d lie about something big just as easily. At this point I was stunned, didn’t know how to handle a grown man shouting at me and wasn’t even being heard cause he kept interrupting and huffing every time I spoke so I asked him to leave and he stormed out. \n\nI texted him the following morning and he didn’t reply. It’s been 2 days now and no contact I assume he’s ended things. I’ve never seen him even raise his voice and I can’t stop thinking about it, I’m unsure if I’m right or wrong.",

I'm not judging your situation, plenty of working people claim benefits, however if you can afford to pay for treatments you are either not fully declaring what you earn( which would result in your benefits being lowered) or you are sacrificing other things which may benefit your kids.

    "body": "Hello! First off, I just want to say how grateful I am for this subreddit, I genuinely don’t think I would’ve had the courage or inspiration to start this journey without it.\n\nSome background: I’m 24F, and my hair loss started in 2020. Things progressively got worse and really hit a low point in late 2024. I think it was due to a bunch of issues of issues: I had COVID early on (which definitely kicked off the hair-loss), Long-term vitamin D deficiency and iron levels always on the low end (on and off since 2018), weight loss (especially in 2024, I lost 40 lbs), zero understanding of how to care for my wavy/curly hair, and I was just *constantly* stressed out.\n\nI started to realize just how bad it was getting mid 2024. I ordered some 5% minoxidil foam but hesitated for months. I had a hard time accepting that starting minoxidil could mean shedding the little hair I had left before it MIGHT get better, hated the idea of being on it “forever,” and was nervous about the risk to my cats.\n\nBut after seeing those first two photos of my scalp, I finally bit the bullet in Sept 2024. As scared as I was about starting minoxidil, the state of my hair terrified me even more. I started applying men's 5% foam minoxidil every night (sometimes twice a day but I couldn't stick to this routine). I started seeing a little bit of progress, baby hairs growing in, sparsity was less noticeable, but nothing crazy. I also did not have a shedding period, and if I did then I didn't notice, as I was already constantly shedding crazy amount of hair.\n\nDecember 2024: I tried to get a derm appointment. My primary doctor referred me, but the request was denied (apparently my case wasn’t “severe enough” 🦅). However, even though I wasn't able to get an appointment, a dermatologist looked at my medical history and diagnosed me with TE, which allowed my doctor to prescribe me oral minoxidil. I started at 0.625mg and bumped to 1.25mg after a month because I wasn’t experiencing any side effects, while still applying the foam every night.\n\nOther changes I made since then:\n\n* Got a silk pillowcase and started using a silk bonnet.\n* Switched to washing my hair more often (used to be every 3–4 days, now it’s every 1–2).\n* Ditched gentle non-sulfate shampoos and switched to harsher shampoos, my main ones are: Pantene Volume & Body, Pantene Miracles Infinite Lengths, Nizoral Ketoconazole.\n* Switched conditioners to Dove Conditioner Intensive Repair and Nioxin System 3 Conditioner.\n* Religiously taking vitamins:\n   * Iron, vitamin D, women’s multivitamin (Costco)\n   * Also: pumpkin seed oil, fish oil, and Nature’s Bounty Hair, Skin & Nails 1–2x/week (too much biotin breaks me out)\n* I try to eat more protein.\n* Stopped heat styling (I used to straighten my hair 5x/week)\n* Started using products to keep the hair I already have healthy. I hate how pricey these products are but Olaplex No.7 and Kerastase 8H night serum have been great for my super fine hair.\n* This one hurts...I gave up black box dye\n* No more ponytails, I try to keep it down as much as possible, otherwise claw clip.\n\nThings I tried but could not keep up consistently:\n\n* Red light therapy. I got a reasonably priced red light cap, but I couldn't keep up with it for long enough to say whether it helped at all. I hated the sweaty/hot feeling on my scalp.\n* Derma stamping. I only managed to do this 4–5 times in a month, but I swear I saw progress. Will revisit this.\n* Scalp serums. They make my scalp feel great but I can't justify the cost for the small return I've observed.\n* Reducing my stress. I just don't think it's possible while I remain in the corporate hell hole so it is what it is. \n\nNow it's been 9 months on foam, and 6 months on oral. I’m using both nightly.\n\nI didn't experience too many symptoms with the foam, I recall there being a short adjustment period where my performance at the gym took a small dip, but that's pretty much it.\n\nI didn't experience any symptoms when I started oral 0.625mg.\n\nWith oral (1.25mg):\n\n* Faster body/facial hair growth (need to dermaplane/shave weekly now)\n* Water retention/bloating after salty meals (only I notice, plus the scale)\n* Resting heart rate went up by \\~10 bpm (was low to begin with)\n* Early on, I had nights where my heartbeat felt stronger than normal, but that faded\n\n**TL;DR**: 9 months on minoxidil. Big lifestyle and haircare changes. Learned not to completely abuse my hair. No magic fix, but progress is happening.",

I’ve noticed visible improvement, my scalp is filling in again, and I’m starting to feel more hopeful about growing my hair long and keeping it healthy.\n\nHere’s what I’ve been doing very simple, affordable, and consistent:\n\n🧴 Products I use:\n\nFibrology Shampoo (every wash)\nI alternate between Dream Lengths Conditioner and a Growth Booster Conditioner every 3 days\nI wash my hair every 3 days like clockwork\n💧 Other habits:\n\nI drink more water daily\nI comb my hair every day (gently)\nI’ve been working on reducing stress (this made a huge difference in how my scalp felt)\nNo excessive heat styling or harsh brushing\nI honestly didn’t expect much with such a simple routine, but comparing my scalp photos from May to July, the improvement is clear. My hair feels stronger, and there’s noticeably more volume near the crown.\n\nWhat I’m still working on:\nI’d love advice on how to support length retention and keep my hair growing longer without breakage. I want to avoid falling back into bad habits and really build a sustainable routine.\n\nIf anyone has tips on:\n\nSupplements (biotin? collagen?)\nHair oils (argan, rosemary?)\nProtective styles\nDiet changes\n…I’d really appreciate it!\n\nThanks in advance 💛 and if anyone needs encouragement or has questions about my routine, I’m happy to help!",

I use the one in the gold bottle. My density issues are confined to my sides. I see a huge difference at about half of a bottle’s worth of use.\n\nI usually sleep with my hair in a loose French braid and have satin pillow cases\n\nAlso, about once a month I use I hard water buildup remover shampoo because I have super hard water and it makes my hair fragile, which tends to thin it out after a while.\n\nFor reference, I am 49.

I was never good at curly girl style lol.  I did try spraying homemade rosemary water on the sides of the temples everyday hahahaha but that I wasn't good at the upkeep cause I read one person had successs with doing it 2x a day.\n\nI dont believe in any kind of supplement pills though!

    "body": "Hey lovelies!\n\nHere are somethings I learned while on this journey. I'm hoping it can help someone else out. Please feel free to add/subtract/share your stories with this.\n\nThis post is for people who believe in doctors/medications, not for people who prefer ONLY natural remedies. However, see points 16,17, 30 for natural remedies.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Disclaimer: this is just my experience, it might not actually be the be what works for you. I'm using 5% minox foam, one time a day, and this is what I've learned. I will regularly edit this as more things come to mind. Please drop a comment about what you think!:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. There are 4 stages of hair growth. Anagen (growing), Catagen (transition), Telogen (resting), and exogen (shedding) stages. Minoxidil works first by causing the exogen to speed up, and then works backwards to Telogen, and kindly causes those resting hairs to shed as well. This is what happens in the first 'dread shed', which can last anywhere from 2-8 weeks.\n2. At any given time, approx. 10% of hair is in the resting phase. This is what falls out first.\n3. Increasing circulation in your scalp is what keeps your hair in the Anagen phase, but that will also eventually shift into Catogen, and so on.\n4. This dread shed is a good sign that your scalp is reacting well to Minox. Minox is a vasodilator and acts by providing more oxygen to your scalp. This oxygen is what provides the follicles with the proper nutrients to go back to Anagen and Catogen phase.\n5. If you start applying minoxidil to a specific location, you need to continue to apply it there. Stopping while using minoxidil will cause the hair to go back to its deoxygenated strand.\n6. Minox is not going to replace healthy hair from a healthy lifestyle. You need to eat well and get some exercise in, no matter what formulation you use.\n7. Minox works well with other vitamins such as Viviscal, Nutrafol, and other multivitamins.\n8. Rest also plays a crucial role in hair regrowth. Increased cortisol (stress hormone) may cause increased hairloss. Adults should aim for 7-9 hours daily, or however your doctor prescribes.\n9. While other people may have faster results than some when using minox, it should be noted that their hair cycle may be a bit different than yours. Results are usually seen by 6 month mark. Some might not even have dread shed.\n10. If you have dread shed, just note, it will be everywhere. Sweaters, drains, floors, everywhere. It is distressing. Take a deep breath but do not stop using until told by a doctor.\n11. Here are a couple of items that have helped reduce the friction/breakage caused by everyday activities: Boar-bristle brushes, velvet/silk hair scrunchies, silk/satin pillow cases, silk night caps.\n12. Be as gentle as you can possibly be with your hair.\n13. You will/should normally shed anywhere with 50-100 hairs a day. It might look like more if you have thicker or longer hair, and it might look like less if you have thinner and shorter hair.\n14. Hair volume and hair density are not the same thing. Density is the number of strands. Volume is the thickness of each strand. anything 3+ inches thick when wrapped in a ponytail is considered thick hair. 2-3 is medium thick. <1 is thin.\n15. Applying minox at night and using a combination of rosemary oil/peppermint oil the day of the wash (wake up earlier and apply \\~1 hour before shower, if morning shower) will also help with increased circulation.\n16. Rosemary and peppermint oils are natural vasodilators. Sting like hell if you get it in your eye. To use, add a couple of drops to a carrier oil (coconut, jojoba, castor) and apply to affected areas. Caution: these things are pungent.\n17. Taking a warm shower (not washing hair)  half an hour before application helps with pores on the scalp to open up and may increase absorption.\n18. Sweat on hair will reduce minoxidil absorption.\n19. Dermarolling may increase absorption. The thickness of the dermaroller may vary by scalp and by ethnicity. usually 1.5mm is thick enough. Do not use this everyday. Start by parting hair and rolling back and forth in one direction. You should not bleed profusely. Roll over all affected areas. Start with 1x every two weeks, then increase as you see fit. Beware, things maybe marked as 1.5mm needles when they're not. Best to measure if you can. Ones with needles may work better than wheel dermarollers. Sanitize after every use. Replace every few months, as needles might become dull.\n20. To avoid cutting the hair accidentally, may work better if hair is wet. Apply minox after dermarolling, maybe 20-30 minutes, as you feel comfortable.\n21. AGA (androgenic alopecia) and TE (telogen effluvium). AGA can be hormonal, where TE might be caused by stress.\n22. Hairloss caused by TE usually grows back if conditions change.  Stress management is unbelievably important in hair regrowth.\n23. Any sort of anesthesia can cause TE. Yes, even something as small as wisdom tooth removal.\n24. Continued use of minox is the only way to see && keep the results. It is a lifestyle you must commit to, only stopping when doctor says so (pregnancy && breastfeeding).\n25. As of today, Minox is the only FDA approved medication to treat hair loss, even for continued use. Using a stronger dosage of Minox won't necessarily help, past the 5% as the efficacy plateaus at 5%.\n26. There are things called DHT blockers which stop testosterone from being converted into a harmful chemical that causes hair to go into early telogen/exogen phases. These things include saw palmetto and things of the like. However, do not use this supplement until cleared by a doctor as it may cause side affects for child bearing women.\n27. Pura d'or is a brand that makes shampoo specifically with topical biotin and DHT blockers. Ask doc/do research/try if it's best for you.\n28. Do not let minox drip down on your face. it might cause hair growth on your face. unless you want that! more power to you!!! After application, wash hands and face.\n29. Might not be suitable for people with pets. Be sure to talk to a doctor/do your own research before beginning anything.\n30. Garlic, onions, ginger, curry leaves are known natural foods that help with hair loss.\n31. **Shedding is different than hair loss.** Shedding is when you see strands fall on your bed sheets, sink, counters, etc. Loss is when your hair physically miniaturizes (shrinks/breaks in size).\n32. It is impossible to tell to the naked eye what is miniturized and what is new growth, but some say tapered ends of hair strands mean miniturized and hair that sticks up when dry is new growth.However, this is a bit of conjecture as hair that hasn't been cut before might look tapered. Best to have a derm take a look. \n33. if you feel lightheaded when applying minox, it's a sign that you applied too much.\n34. PATCH. TEST. FIRST. TO SEE. IF YOU. HAVE. ANY DAMN. REACTIONS TO THIS! don't just straight up apply. you could be allergic.\n35. Some people may have adverse dermatological (aging faster, wrinkles) or oxotoxic (tinnitus) effects. Stop use if you experience any of these and talk to a doctor, but know that these are rare.\n36. Purchase a scalp scrubber brush, to really clean your scalp if you are going days between washing hair, but using minox.\n37. Always, always ALWAYS, apply to a dry scalp. the foam, at least, takes 3-4 hours to be absorbed.\n38. LIGHTING. IS. EVERYTHING. it may make your hair loss look worse than it actually is.\n39. Please use common sense. If you have hormonal deficiencies or vitamin deficiencies, no matter *what* you use, you might not see results until the underlying problem is addressed. ***One of the most common vitamin deficiencies is Vitamin D. Unbalanced Vitamin D levels can cause hair loss.*** \n40. Don't be afraid to get a second opinion from another dermatologist. Hair loss can also be an endocrine problem (endocrine system regulates hormones), check out an endocrinologist if still concerned. They may assign some bloodwork, maybe regularly. \n41. Protein intake is extremely important for hair regrowth. Your hair is primarily made of protein and sulfate bonds. For the average sedentary woman, you need 46 grams/day. DRI says 0.36 grams of protein per pound, adjust as you see necessary. Be careful, however, too much protein maybe stored as fat. \n\nI am a very impatient person. I blame technology for a part of this. What helped me out is to have a physical daycount of how many days have gone by and how many days more I have left before I hit 3 months. Then i'll do it again for another 3 months. ***These things take time. Let them, and give it an honest effort. Do not stop using it when you see more hair falling out. wish that weak, deoxygenated hair a good riddance. better, thicker strands will replace this one. Just because it has/hasn't worked for someone in the past, doesn't mean it will/won't work for you. Hair is individual, your doctor will know best.***\n\nhere is a silly thing that kept me going. Above my line of vision at my desk, I have a post it note that says the following: \"Take your time, things will get better. Do your best. take a deep breath. It will happen. It will be okay.\" If you made it this far in the post, I am giving you the biggest virtual hug I possibly can. My inbox is ALWAYS open to vents/rants. Sometimes it's easier to vent to a stranger. Don't keep this anxiety bottled up inside, it's not good for anyone.\n\nyou are beautiful. with or without hair, you are beautiful. It sucks what you're going through. Believe me, I know. keep your head up, and do everything you can. you will see a change in due time. Do not compare your chapter 1 to someone else's chapter 4. Commit to this. You got this, babe! Celebrate every little victory!\n\nLast of all, do NOT, by any means, let ANYONE belittle you because of something you cannot control. Do NOT be ashamed of this. this is something that affects a lot of women, and we have been stigmatized to not only not discuss this with other women (WTF, right?) but also fall prey to hair care scams across the internet. Do your research, and stay informed. You are doing your absolute best. That is the only thing anyone can ask of you, and more importantly, you can ask of yourself. This takes time. I repeat, this takes time.",

I’m in shock, I’m happy, and kind of in disbelief. \n\n  Short summary, I’ve been going through telogen effluvium (overall thinning of hair, unknown reasons) and nothing has worked. Expensive scalp treatments, doctors, dermatologists, every OTC hair product, medicated shampoos, biotin...nothing has worked for months. I’ve spent maybe 10k. This sounds so silly but seeing full locks of hair fall out in your hands is honestly tragic. Especially as a woman when hair is a large part of feeling feminine. \n\n I recently added zinc to make a ZMA stack (already have taken magnesium glycinate, and b6 p-5-p for almost a year) and figured, huh I’ll just throw this into the mix.\n\n 3 weeks later and....I’m in shock staring at my shower drain. Literally standing here in a towel crying. \n\n Apparently, unbeknownst to me, zinc deficiency can cause hair loss. No doctor has ever suggested this, and looking at my 2 blood panel tests I’ve taken this year, I’ve realized zinc wasn’t even a part of the tests. \n\n Just wanted to leave my experience in case anyone is going through something similar. Thanks for reading.",

    "body": "*Haii cutie!* I got some ppl asking for a hair guide so. Here’s your step-by-step playbook. No fluff, just *HAIR*.  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Nourish From the Inside**  \n*Healthy hair starts with what you eat!*  \n- **Protein**: Eggs, fish, tofu, nuts.  \n- **Healthy Fats**: Avocado, olive oil, omega-3s (fish oil supplements).  \n- **Hydrate**: Drink water like it’s your job.  \n- **Supplements**: Biotin + collagen for shine and strength.  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Wash & Hydrate Like a Pro**  \n*Less is more, bestie.*  \n- **Shampoo**: Use sulfate-free formulas 1-2x/week. *Greasy hair?* Focus on the scalp. (Straight hair can be washed more often)  \n- **Conditioner/Oils**: Apply mid-lengths to ends. *Fine/straight hair?* Use sparingly. *Thick/curly?* Load up!  \n- **Scalp Care**: Massage gently while washing to boost blood flow. (Makes growth faster)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Avoid Heat Damage**  \n*Protect those strands!*  \n- **Air-Dry**: Skip the blow-dryer when possible.  \n- **Heat Tools**: Use curling irons/straighteners *max 1-2x/week*. Always apply heat protectant spray first!  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Style for Femme Vibes**  \n*Cuts, products, and hacks to slay.*  \n\n#### **Haircut Tips:**  \n- **Face-Framing Layers**: Curtain bangs, wolf cuts, or shag styles.  \n- **Volume Tricks**: Add layers and texture if hair’s flat. *Poofy/curly?* Avoid dry brushing—use a wide-tooth comb on wet hair.  \n- **Closeted-Friendly**: Shoulder-length or shorter cuts (e.g., two-block with longer top) or suttle highlights.  \n\n#### **Styling Hacks:**  \n- **Salt Spray**: For beachy texture + volume.  \n- **Accessories**: Clips, headbands, or silk scarves.  \n- **Softening Trick**: Tuck hair behind ears to highlight feminine features.  \n- **Secret Perfume Hack**: Spritz your brush with fragrance before brushing.  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Femme Hairstyles to Try**  \n1. **Wolf Cut/Shag**: Edgy layers for volume.  \n2. **Pixie Cut**: Bold and androgynous.  \n3. **Bob**: Chin-length or lob (long bob). *Avoid blunt cuts if round-faced!* \n4. **Two-Block**: Short sides, longer top (suttle femme).  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Note: Confidence > Perfection**  \nYour hair will not look like an Instagram filter after a day of doing this. Embrace your natural texture, experiment, and *own your hair*.\n\nI run a private community where I help femboys with advice, guides, and a supportive space. No hype—just real value.

For instance, one of the largest nutrition studies ever conducted found that fish oil supplements significantly increased risk for type 2 diabetes, one of our leading causes of death, and eggs are high in LDL cholesterol which is a major risk factor for our number 1 killer heart disease. Yes there are infamous studies to the contrary, but they were funded by the industries themselves. There are good omega 3 supplements made from other things like algae or lichen, but you really shouldn't need them if you're eating a balanced diet rich in fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

I’m old and was toast. Went all on right out of the gate.\n\nWhy roll and not stamp: stamping at 1.5mm can cause scarring. At this depth, significant research shows rolling is better.\n\nWhy wait so long to start: I didn’t know about the options until 2 years ago\n\nStyle your hair the same or your photos are dogshit and useless: my hair is much longer now and I do the best I can to show a fair comparison. Believe me or don’t, that’s up to you.\n\nSide effects: none, everything still works fine\n\nLabs: 2x/year, all normal\n\nHappy to answer questions!",

I initially started with Fin but due to the extreme insomnia I received ended up switching over to Dut after the first 1.5 month. NO side effects whatsoever on Dut! This next part may sound kind of crazy but hear me out. 30 minutes after taking the medication and allowing it to built up into my bloodstream I will brush my hair/scalp for 25-30 minutes simulating blood flow to the scalp. I also do this once again at nighttime, using a medium coarse wave brush. The day 1 pic is just to show an up close of thinning in the dome area and especially the temples. However, the day 30 and month 4 pics are more comparable as they have the same hair length! ",

I experienced a shed last week and a I see vellus hairs coming in where Ive been applying min 2x per day 2ML on my hairline and crown/middle bald areas. I continue 1mg Fin Daily along with my regular regimen the last 3 weeks. Since I already posted what I’m on previously, please read my previous posts to answer your questions. \n\nI know I have a long ways to go and I’m still “bald” but I feel like I can get away with longer hair to cover my spots now (not that I gave a F in my first pic for so many years haha). I am curious to see where I will be at in 6 months and at that point will reassess if a HT is the line I take. \n\nNew ads ons on top of my current regimen from my previous posts.\n\n- shampoo with biotin and collagen for volume \n- MSM powder 3g daily \n- Derma Stamp adjustable - I use 1.5mm x a week then apply topical min \n\nIf I see any common or new questions not asked before I will answer as quickly as possible. Discipline is everything, LFG!!!",

    "body": "TL;DR at the bottom with the key findings.\n\nI made a survey last week asking about people’s experiences using minoxidil to grow beards. It got a whopping *108* responses! The point of doing this was firstly to get a general picture of key things like when it kicks in for most people, if it works at all etc., but secondly I wanted to do some light-touch statistics as well to see how things like age and minoxidil type affect beard growth.\n\n\n\n\n**So what do you guys look like?**\n\nI’m going start out by breaking a cardinal rule and assume everyone’s gender (We’re all guys, right? I would have asked for gender in the survey, but was limited to 15 questions!).\n\n[The average age was 25.0 years](https://imgur.com/a/FHv0fYr). Most people were between about 18-early 30’s, but there’s a few guys here who are 40-50. All but one respondent were currently using minoxidil. [Most of you have been using for 3-6 months](https://imgur.com/a/r63PGpb) (27.8%), but users for 2-3 months (14.8%) and 6 months - 1 year (17.6%) are also pretty common.\n\nBefore using minoxidil, [more of you describe your facial hair as being “some but not much”](https://imgur.com/a/PJr5W1D) (37%) than anything else. Having “extremely little”, “some” and “a fair bit, but still patchy” were also fairly common, while having “non-existent” hair (5.6%) and “really quite a lot” (0.9%) were the least common. Needless to say, no-one started out with full coverage.\n\n\n**Shut up and tell me how often it works!**\n\nThe good news is responsiveness to minoxidil seems to be really high. Only one person (0.9%) reported that minoxidil flat-out has done nothing for them. Another 19.4% of you aren’t necessarily seeing changes but believe it’s too soon to say, while the rest of you think it has worked either “somewhat” (32.4%) or the most common response; “completely” (47.2%). \n\nSure enough, most of the people who think it’s too soon to say haven’t been using minox for long; 71.4% of them have been users for <2 months, while none of them have been using for longer than 3-6 months. This implies there’s likely real truth in people who said this, rather than them having used minox for a year but living in denial about it not working for them. Speaking of which…\n\n\n**So when should it kick in?**\n\n[Minoxidil most often kicks in between 1-2 months after starting](https://imgur.com/a/pjRN2Ys) (31.5%). There’s then a very even split on either side of this with people who also frequently report changes seen between 2 weeks - 1 month (20.4%), and 2-3 months (19.4%). Similarly, the same number of people report changes in less than 2 weeks (10.2%) or in 3-6 months (10.2). Beyond that, there was only one respondent who reported changes kicking in later than 6 months (specifically they said it started after 1 - 1.5 years of using!). \n\nWhat can we say from this? Well, it might seem like you’re doomed if you’ve not seen changes by 6 months, but remember that we’ve already seen that there is an almost-total over-representation of people who are current users of minox in the survey. As people are more likely to give up using it the longer they try without results there’s no telling how many have given up around 6 months who might have gone on to grow if they persisted a little longer. All the same I think it’s safe to say that most people get results by 3 months, and then a few extra by 6 instead.\n\n\n**How much extra growth can I expect?**\n\nThe survey asked people to estimate what % of “full” beard coverage they had when they started minox, and again what % they now had. This means we can guesstimate a % increase in beard growth brought on by the minoxidil. For these figures I’m going to exclude the people who said they haven’t seen changes from the last section as there’s little meaning in including them here.\n\nThe average increase in beard growth, among “responders”, is 31.3%. [However, the distribution of this is not-normal](https://imgur.com/a/WKR5aLb). I mean this statistically, not that your newly-grown facial hair looks weird; so essentially while some of you are reporting massive gains up to and even beyond 80%, half of you are seeing increases of only 25% or less (i.e. 25% is the median). \n\n\n**How ill is it going to make me feel?**\n\nSide effects are pretty common! In decreasing prevalence, 33% of respondents reported general skin irritation, 28.7% baggy eyes, 20.4% faster heartbeat, 15.7% heart palpitations, 9.3% mood changes and 6.5% acne. All in all, 67.6% of people reported at least one of these side effects. \n\nOver half of you (59.3%) also said that minoxidil has affected other parts of your body, growing out hair elsewhere.\n\n\n**How common is “shedding” of hair, and good god when will it end?**\n\nIt gets talked about a lot but hair shedding is, maybe surprisingly, quite uncommon. Exactly 3 quarters of respondents (75%) have not experienced a shed of hair. Of those who have it most often kicked in around 3-6 months (9.3% of all respondents), 6-12 months (5.6%) or 1-2 months (4.6%).\n\n[The good news is it’s also quite reliable that shedding of hair does end](https://imgur.com/a/wWQKFAE). Within the people who said they’ve had a shed of hair, it has ended in 63% (usually after 1-2 months). While 37% said it’s still ongoing so they can’t yet say, it seems reasonable that it is set to end for these people given how most respondents have been using for 6 months or less, and that sheds tend to start leading up to 6 months.\n\n\n**“I am an 80 year old, testosterone-negative, vegan juggalo. How will this affect my chances?”**\n\nWell I can’t answer that question, but I’m going to finish by talking about a few statistical analyses to see how different factors can influence % gain in beard hair. For any nerds out there these are predominantly non-parametric because of the non-normal distribution of that variable.\n\n*Liquid vs. Foam*\n\nOverall people slightly more often use liquid (58.9%), vs. foam (41.1%), but only by a smallish margin. Only 2.7% of people (3 respondents) are using a 10% solution rather than 5% (liquid in each of these cases).\n\nIgnoring now people who have said they haven’t had changes (as described in the earlier section), **there is no difference in beard growth between 5% liquid and 5% foam** (Mann-Whitney U test, p=0.380). [Chart](https://imgur.com/a/QEojV5H)\n\n*Age*\n\nAn old (no pun intended) question is if the elderly 30+ year olds among us are going to struggle more, and it seems like there is something to this. Looking at all survey respondents, there’s a very strong negative correlation between age and % beard growth increase, [meaning the older someone is the less gains they see](https://imgur.com/a/HkfbCgI) (Spearmans correlation, coefficient= -0.338, p= <0.001).\n\nBut is it that straightforward? After all, the older someone is the more beard they’re going to have grown naturally in the first place so maybe there’s just fewer gains left that are available to a 30 year old versus an 18 year old?\n\n[Sure enough, there’s an almost-equally strong positive correlation between age and how much beard hair they started out with](https://imgur.com/a/27CnQDZ) (Spearmans correlation, coefficient= 0.336, p= <0.001). So this lends some strength to the idea that older users may simply be closer to their full potential already.\n\nSo can we work out if age still impact gains while taking into account the idea that older people start out with more hair anyway? Yes we can, in what’s called a multiple regression. Doing this with age and % starting coverage of beard hair both as covariates shows us that while how much hair you start out with is extremely relevant to how much you gain (p= <0.001), age is still negatively affecting gains even when that is taken into account (albeit less significantly; p= 0.041).\n\n**So all in all yes, older people do find it tougher to make gains and that is not wholly to do with having more to start out with.**\n\n*Dermarolling*\n\nAbout half of you guys are dermarolling and half aren’t (52.8% yes vs. 47.2% no). Dermarolling seems to be one of the most well-spoken about things [but interestingly it shows absolutely no relationship to beard gains in the data from this survey](https://imgur.com/a/pBv67tT) (Mann-Whitney U test, p=0.581)\n\n*Other Supplements*\n\nIn fact, none of the supplements collected showed any relationship with beard gains. These included “oils”, “creams” and “dietary supplements”, as well as biotin or tretinoin which I added in after quite a few people recorded using these as comments. Needless to say some of these may be getting used for reasons other than promoting beard growth (e.g. creams for skin irritation) so this isn’t to say these are entirely without use in the beard growing journey.\n\n*Some other questions that occurred to me*\n\n“What if having side effects were a sign of your body taking up more of the minox and therefore an indication you might be a better responder?” No - none of the side effects predicted more beard growth.\n\n“I’m male-pattern balding so clearly ‘hair’ isn’t my strong suit. Does this affect my chances?” Interestingly, there may be something here. 18.5% of respondents said they were experiencing male-pattern balding at the start or using minox. Now we should consider that these people are likely to be older, and we already know that age has a negative relationship with gains, so I did another multiple regression to look at if balding predicted gains while taking age into account. [And it does](https://imgur.com/a/1lDDTEu) (p= 0.033)! **People who are already experiencing male-pattern balding are less likely to make gains than people who aren’t**, even when taking into account their age. It’s a cruel world…\n\n“If I’m noticing minox make my hair grow elsewhere does this mean I’m really responsive to it and my beard gains are going to be more epic?” [Apparently also yes](https://imgur.com/a/t1feBo3); people saying minox is affecting other parts of their body also report more beard gains (Mann-Whitney U test, p= 0.021)\n\n\n**Shout outs / special mentions**\n\nThe guy who “doesn’t have time” to dermaroll anymore because he’s now got a girlfriend.\n\n2 guys are joint-biggest gainers being tied on an 85% increase in % coverage (one started between 6 months - 1 year ago, the other between 1 year - 1.5 years).\n\nThe 18 Schrodingers who both haven’t experienced a shed of hair, and who found their shed of hair lasted up to 3 months before it stopped.\n\nCommiserations to that one and only person who definitely thinks minox hasn’t worked for them at all\n\n\n**TL;DR / The Conclusions**\n\nMinox seems to work quite reliably and almost everyone is reporting some gains or (reasonably) saying it’s too soon to judge. It kicks in most often between 1-2 months, and has kicked in for a strong majority of people by 3 months (about 1 in 10 take up to 6 months). You might reasonably expect a 25% increase in beard “coverage” through using minoxidil; there are some mega-responders by they are relatively few and far between. A quarter of you will experience a hair “shed”, usually about 3-6 months into using minox but maybe before or after this; don’t worry because it seems to resolve by about 2 months after it starts in most people, and by 3 months in pretty much everyone. About two thirds of you can expect some side effect or other, the most common being skin irritations, baggy eyes and a faster heartbeat.\n\nAll that said, a number of things do and do-not seem to affect how much growth you can expect. Being older and already experiencing male-pattern baldness each individually predict that you will make less beard gains. On the other hand, if you notice minox affecting hair growth elsewhere in your body this is a good sign that you will respond better than average. Finally, using foam vs. liquid doesn’t seem to matter and despite their popularity there were no supplements that helped beard growth. Perhaps most controversially, dermarolling also seems to do fuck-all. \n\nSo as a 30 year old man who’s got fairly progressed male-pattern balding… god dammit.",

I suggest you do.\n\nAs for the topical minoxidil, you are allergic to either the alcohol or PG. Get the alcohol and PG free minoxidil solution. This will help. \nJust to say, you have very fine hair growth but it's not very likely you will recover the temple regions with minoxidil. Options are to try oral minoxidil (supervised by a doctor in the first few weeks). Alternatively, you are edging towards HT surgery.\n\nHave you thought about shaving your whole hair?",

In the future, where you might need a hair transplant, the frequent and deeper derma needles could create a problem with the skin hardness and make it difficult.  So, do look into that on hair transplant doctors' youtube channels.  Also, you don't need to stamp vigorously.  Just take it easy with it, so in the future it won't give you any trouble. \n\n Alspo, make sure you oil your scalp with coconut oil 2-3 times a week, and that is when you should shampoo as well.  You need to wash your scalp every day to get rid of the mino and use Soap Nuts (reetha) powder to wash your hair daily to get rid of mino.  All you need is mix a tbsp with 1-2 tbsp water and wash your head with it.  Btw, soap nuts are used in shampoos.  It's the main ingredient.  It won't foam, but it will wash your hair.  You can also add a once a week Apple Cider Vinegar regiment to clean your scalp.  1 tbsp ACV+1tbsp water, and soak it with a cotton ball or whichever way you want.  Leave for 15 minutes and then rinse it.  Always gently massage the coconut oil whenever you use them.\n\nBtw, I'm very happy about your progress.  I think I'm going to take my regiment seriously so I can get back my widow's peak and temples or save whatever is left of it.",

Now my beard connects and is shaped nicely.\n\nMy routine:\n- Minoxidil 2x a day\n- Dermaroll 2x a week\n- Beard balm/oil after Minoxidil dries\n- Moisturize after beard balm/oil\n\nSome of the best tips I got are:\n- Consistency > Perfection\n- Dermaroll\n- Moisturize your skin\n- Make a skincare routine\n- Biotin and Collagen seemed to help\n- Sleep, Exercise, & Eat well\n- Take progress pics \n\nFeel free to ask me anything or check out my [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@monkybeard?si=fNmhcKOj-qYCGXq3) where I explain my journey.\n\nThank you all for encouraging me to do this journey. 🙏 I am so happy with my beard results. I feel like I did the impossible and now my whole mindset has changed. It is a long journey, but you can do it! \n\nStay Strong Beard Brother 💪 ",

    "body": "**EDIT from April 2024** I still have been getting a lot of replies to this post and I finally have time to give a proper update. I still don't recommend cluster lashes from the damage I received wearing them for 1 week at a time. For that reason, I've deleted the original content of this post along with the spreadsheet. I'll still do my best to give an updated objective review, both pros and cons, of the Lashify system based on my knowledge as a lash artist.\n\nTo give some context, I wrote the original post about 3 years ago before I went to esthetician school and got trained on lashes. I had also received traditional lash extensions that were done poorly from 3 different people. That coupled with the fact that everyone always said that lash extensions damage your lashes made me look DEEP into DIY methods. Lash lifts and tints didn't give the effect I wanted. Ardell individuals with their glue was pretty painful to apply. Wearing strips daily was uncomfortable. So under the lash clusters like Lashify really appealed to me.\n\nOne thing I will say about Lashify is that they ARE the best under the lash clusters that you can find. You can mimic a set of traditional extensions by about 90%, without the texture and desired curl. I still check on them from time to time because it's cool to see their innovations. They're regularly coming out with new styles, colors, lengths, and thinner bands (which they call spines). There's a reason why they're priced higher than the rest. Their cluster styles are often imitated by smaller brands you see on Amazon and the like.\n\nTheir accessories? Eh. Not so much. You can always find cheaper alternatives to their bonds and application tools. Of course, they're gonna tell you that their bond is infused with biotin (probably a negligible amount) and their fuse wand is the safest and easiest way to apply the clusters. I always found their fuse wand to be cumbersome, so I opted for a 45 degree volume tweezer for lash extensions. I remember posting that on the Lashify-dedicated sub with negative responses with whom I assume to be Lashify workers or stans.\n\nWhich leads me to my next point: the CEO and members of their Facebook group are not the kindest of people. Sahara (CEO) had lambasted MannyMUA about not using her system correctly when he was just confused about it. Any Google search regarding her and Manny MUA will show you her sexist responses to his review that has yet to have been followed up with a proper apology. Her bullying behavior didn't stop there either. She and her followers have gone to attack smaller brands who have also adopted the under the lash clusters model. Now, I get that Sahara has the patent and wants to protect her IP. But that does that warrant her and her fans from calling a blonde spokesperson of another company the Great Value version of a blonde Lashify spokesperson? 😑\n\nLots of misinformed ideas have been spread in the group (either by the CEO or members) that I'll try my best to summarize below:\n\n- Wearing the clusters for 2 weeks at a time: Sahara did advertise these as one time wear clusters that aren't meant to be worn for 3 days. Wearing these for prolonged periods of time will cause damage each of your natural lashes from the clusters being way too heavy.\n\n- Stacking: basically, it's their method of adding another layer of clusters to give a fuller/denser look. Again, this will damage your lashes from the weight.\n\n- Cleaning clusters by soaking them in rubbing alcohol: I get that people want to save as much $$ as possible by being able to rewear them. The reality is that moisture/water fucks up the curl and delicacy of the clusters. Sahara also stated that her eye doctor recommends to dispose the clusters after one use to avoid eye infections.\n\n- Adjusting the curl by using their Lashicurl heat curler: Really, not what you expect in execution. It merely crimps the clusters in a way that isn't all that cute.\n\n- they're (supposedly) damage free DIY lash extensions at home: they do advertise this heavily. Again, not completely true due to the nature of your natural lashes not being isolated with 1 natural lash to 1 lash extension/fan.\n\nI personally switched from Lashify/clusters to traditional lash extensions and my natural lashes are more full than when I was doing clusters for 2 years. I also came to realize that I spent more on Lashify per month than I do with fills.\n\nIf you don't have the time or budget for extensions, the cluster systems can be a more efficient route for you. Just be cognizant of the fact that they aren't absolutely damage free. Look for a thin spine like Lilac St or Lashify to reduce any additional weight. Don't wear these for more than 3 days and remove them properly with an oil based remover.\n\n\n\n**EDIT from Oct 2023:** I no longer use Lashify or any DIY cluster lash systems. I am learning in esthetitician/lash school that these methods are not healthy for your natural lashes. These systems are meant to be TEMPORARY. Please do not try to keep these on for a week, or 3+ weeks like some brands like to advertise. Trust me, I would love a DIY lash option but these aren't it.\n",

I'm definitely going to check out your recs for lashes and the House of Lashes glue! \n\nAndddd the fact that your lash routine is in a spreadsheet makes my heart so happy. Amazing.

I think the tutorial on their site says to use too much glue and contradicts the pamphlet in the control kit where it says to only brush on the glue once?? I was considering buying the bondage glue but would I have the same issue?\n\nI've been trying SEVERAL different methods & brands of lashes and lashify's under-lash application wasn't new to me. It compares to me buying strip lash Duo glue on accident instead of cluster lash glue and using Ardell Faux mink clusters. My method was less than $20 & I think lashify is super overpriced.

Only people who have struggled with their weight can understand the emotional tole this can have on you and I’m so grateful to have found this community 🙏🏽 I ordered the medication on Thurs 25th July and didn’t get a response or an approval until I emailed MedExoress (based in UK) and they flagged my prescription and it was approved literally a few seconds later, Royal Mail then emailed me and it’s being delivered tomorrow (Tuesday 30th). I think all your positive comments made me so impatient I just wanted to get started so emailed 🤣 \n\nI took some pics last night and weighed myself again earlier as when I had to weigh myself to do the prescription I was on my period. I’m 28, 5’7 and 110.9kg/244lbs/17.4 stone. (Less than my weight on my period) I go to the gym and I’m planning on continuing to strength training, eat high protein and nutrional meals and do yoga and Pilates. I’ve ordered multivitamins and digestive enzymes. Will order collagen, biotin and electrolytes. I used to take Creatine which I found really helped me at the gym. I’ve started taking it again, from my research it doesn’t have any negative connections with Mounjaro, anyone else take Creatine? \n\nI’m really excited about starting, I feel like once I get my body back in good shape and feel healthy it will trickle down into the rest of my life which hasn’t been great for the last few years, I feel like I am my own worst enemy and I’m done with this vicious harmful cycle. Also, I made a “Glow Up” slideshow for myself 🤣🤣🤣 planning out all different areas of my life I’m going to work on these next few months lmao. I’ll have plenty of time to focus on this now hopefully the food noise is about to stop. I’m not even worried about the side effects, the side effects of being so unhappy with how I look and my body and life outweigh the negatives of mounjaro, I’m aware of them ofc but I want to focus on this new positive journey I’m taking. Thanks again for all the encouragement and will update you tomorrow. Any first timer tips welcome 🤣",

My hair started coming out (telogen effluvium) which I expected because the same exact thing happened to me 3 months after I had a baby. I've been taking biotin and collagen supplements and my weight loss has slowed a bit and I think my hair is at least stable now. \n\nI wish I had thought to wear the same outfit from my first pic, but maybe I'll do that to celebrate my next milestone.

    "body": "There have been plenty of threads on how Minoxidil is toxic to cats. I didn't see any of them when I started using Minoxidil a couple of months ago.\n\nTwo days ago, I apply 1ml of Minoxidil to my head, like I do every morning. Two hours later, it was completely dried. Our cat then licked my head very briefly, and there was a few seconds of contact between her fur and my head. (We usually don't do that because she lives with my roommate upstairs)\n\nTen minutes later, I remembered that cats sometimes have toxic reactions to substances that are harmless for humans. I figured, at least gonna look this up. And what I saw was not good - lots of reports on toxicity, but also lots of people saying they never had a problem and it's no big deal. I take her to the vet immediately, just out of caution, they keep her there for the afternoon. No problem, everything checked, good to go home in the evening.\n\nYesterday, she stopped eating and seemed quite tired and lethargic. I take her back to the vet, and the vet was quite shocked when she saw her: Low temperature, breathing noises, fluid in the lungs, etc... They kept her overnight and gave her infusions and everything, but she did not survive. Dead within 36 hours of exposure.\n\nI'll answer some questions below, in the hope that this saves other cats out there!\n\n**Is this a danger just for cats?**\n\nTo my knowledge, Minoxidil is also dangerous for dogs and other pets.\n\n**Was it really Minoxidil?**\n\nThe symptoms matched exactly Minoxidil poisoning, and they appeared right when they should. The cat had no other health problems, and in fact, a complete bloodwork was done on the first day showing perfect marks. It is extremely unlikely that this was anything other than Minoxidil.\n\n**Which specific tincture did you use?**\n\nThe specific tincture I used was Dualgen-15 with PG from MinoxidilMax. Now, besides Minoxidil, this thing also contains azelaic acid, Finasteride, Retinol, Adenosine, Biotin and Niacinamide (the last three they call \"ABN complex\"). Did a quick Google search, it appears that out of these, Minoxidil is the only one with reported strong toxic effects. So I assume that the other substances did not contribute to the poisoning. But they might have through some weird interactions?\n\n**This is a significant danger, and we should accept that there is risk and uncertainty.**\n\nThere are many cat/minoxidil threads here. Some peolpe say \"Oh, my cat is fine, just wash your hands and it won't be a problem\". I believe that most of these people have not actually read the existing research on Minoxidil poisoning in animals. They just observe that their own cat is fine, and conclude that there's nothing to worry about. They might also want to convince themselves that there is no danger, to feel better.\n\nThis is one case study of a cat that was killed, out of the blue, by a very small amount of Minoxidil. Just one or two licks, and a few seconds of hair/fur contact. I think this shows that there is a significant danger to pets. Perhaps when you are careful, your cat will be completely fine! But it is hard to say just how careful you need to be! This is not a subject where you can get easy answers, and I think we should accept that there is significant uncertainty. The risk is definitely not zero, even when you are careful.",

    "body": "Hi everyone!\n\nI took a little over a year off of university for the year of 2020-21 due to the pandemic and decided to start my glow up journey during my time off.  I wanted to share my experience here because it ended up paying off big time. By the time I went back to my school in NYC to visit my friends, I had so many people telling me how great I looked, noticed positive changes in how people treated me, and was told I looked like a model or actress on many occasions.  I also feel much more comfortable in my own skin, which alone made the whole glow up process more than worth it.\n\nFor context, I am East Asian 20f and was fairly happy with how I looked and dressed but always felt there was room for improvement  *—*  think cute normie vs professional pretty person (e.g. models, actresses, influencers).  What I really strived for was the extra sheen and oomph that the pretty girls on Pinterest seem to have, which I was able to achieve to the best of my abilities.\n\nThe features can be broken down to and will be structured in the post as the following points: **even, glowing skin**, **healthy hair and flattering cut**, **toned body**, and **good styling**. I think this information will be most helpful for those who do not feel the need to drastically lower their BMI, have decent skin (as in not a lot of active acne because I am not qualified to give serious skincare advice), and already have their own personal style.\n\n**Even, glowing skin:** Having healthy even-toned skin on both face and body automatically makes a person look more put-together regardless of skin tone. I noticed this was a common theme for most good-looking people online and in magazines. Here is what I did to achieve this:\n\n* Tretinoin (3x a week): faded sunspots and uneven coloring on face and neck, minimized appearance of pores. Made a huge difference and gave me that smooth and bright model off duty looking skin. This may not be right for everyone and I'm sure regular retinol will work for most.\n* Retinol body lotion (every day after showering): evened out discoloration and texture on my entire body. I used to have darkness on my knees, elbows, armpits, and groin area and using retinol helped even out those areas. [This lotion from amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Clinicals-Anti-Wrinkle-Antioxidants-Ultimate/dp/B00MBTKYEK/ref=sr_1_7?dchild=1&keywords=retinol+body+lotion&qid=1625675864&sr=8-7) worked well for me and is unscented.\n* Sunscreen (every day): Pretty self explanatory. I get hyperpigmentation very easily so this helps prevent it.\n* At-home IPL hair removal (1-2x a week): I used this on my side-wisps/side-burns, facial hair, arms, and armpits. The lack of facial hair made my skin look so much smoother and made my entire face look cleaner and neater overall. Also, as someone with light skin and dark hair, using this on my arms made them look so much slimmer and even-toned.\n* Gradual Self-tan (every other night): I started using the [Tan Luxe Super Glow Body Serum](https://www.sephora.com/product/tan-luxe-super-glow-body-hyaluronic-self-tan-serum-P456989?country_switch=us&lang=en&skuId=2346963&om_mmc=ppc-GG_1918213323_70847767336_pla-419861858544_2346963_353573795207_1013819_c&ds_rl=1261471&gclid=CjwKCAjwoZWHBhBgEiwAiMN66b3rabrzHKhjLgGvF5v7ODIYFsn2v8ZdHIC7lfrBd7OkQtb8IvOgKRoCu84QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) mixed in with my body moisturizer and it made my skin have that beta-carotene glow but also very even-toned. I'm not a huge fan of tanning but this gave me the perfect subtle boost of color.  I do not recommend staying out in the sun too much as it can cause premature aging and discoloration.\n* Moisturize hands (every night): Remember to take care of your hand skin! I and pampered hands makes people look elegant and expensive.  I use [this one from Kiehl's](https://www.kiehls.com/body/hand-creams-hand-salves-and-soaps/ultimate-strength-hand-salve/3700194708399.html?GeoRedirectOff=Off&gclid=CjwKCAjwoZWHBhBgEiwAiMN66b9KhQkU3TYjeG-kfowwp03QjHmT6-OzqgFvzX9hU2hs4ZFCWKL00RoCDXEQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) every night. I'll put my leftover tretinoin and sunscreen on my hands at the end of my skincare routine as well.\n\n**Healthy Hair and Flattering Cut:** About 3 months ago when lockdown was lifted, I went to a fancy salon and spent $720 on highlights and a cut FROM HELL. The stylist completely destroyed my hair to the point where the ends were breaking off and the hair cut made my hair look completely flat. Luckily, I managed to salvage my hair and it now looks even better than it did before. To me, having good hair is so important and really dictates how I feel about my look that day. Also, I got a refund in case anyone was wondering.\n\n* Viviscal hair supplements: This shit rocks! I started noticing that my eyelashes were longer and my eyebrows thicker. I started noticing the hair on my head was growing faster about 1.5 months in. I have tried so many biotin supplements but this is the only one that has worked for me so far. it does make all your other hair grow faster too thought so keep that in mind.\n* Olaplex: Specifically the No. 3 (bond corrector), No. 6 (leave-in treatment), and No. 7 (leave-in oil) really helped fix my damaged hair and made it shiny and soft again. The shampoo and conditioner didn't make a huge difference in my hair IMO and were not worth the money.\n* At-home haircuts: I really recommend investing in some good shears and cutting your own hair at home. It's so much cheaper and there are so many resources online on how to do it. Having good scissors was super helpful for cutting off split ends and shaping my hair exactly how I wanted it to be done. If you don't feel comfortable doing this makes sure to at least invest in a really good haircut as a base and have good scissors to trim split ends at home.\n* At-home hair gloss: I also really like using Redken Shades EQ hair glosses that I purchased off Ebay to make my hair look more vibrant and shiny.\n* Taming flyaways: I used the [R+Co pomade stick](https://www.randco.com/dart-pomade-stick) to tame flyaways. Having smooth hair looks very expensive and polished IMO.\n\n**Toned Body:** My body goal was to get more toned and lose inches on my waist.  I was always naturally thin (BMI 18.5) but felt that I didn't look fit.  Over the course of 3 months, I was able to go from a 25\" to a 23\" waist. I didn't end up losing much overall weight, which I did not feel the need to, due to muscle gain and I feel sleeker and stronger.\n\n* John Benton workouts (3x a week): These workouts are insanely good for building long lean muscle! I gain muscle very easily but following his guides helped me avoid that.  I feel stronger and more confident in my body. To narrow my waist, I completely avoid all oblique exercises. PDF link at bottom.\n* Long distance running (5km 5x a week): I recently got a Nordic Track treadmill and the iFit running videos are a life saver. I used to absolutely hate running but now I actually look forward to it.  Running is so good for increased circulation and is my favorite form of cardio at the moment. Running long distance made my legs a lot slimmer and more toned.\n* Diet: I just cut out snacking and drinking which helped way more than I thought it would.  I also started eating more protein and drinking 1.5L water a day.\n\n**Good Styling:** I always felt that even though I spent a lot of money and effort on clothes, something was holding back my outfits from looking more elevated. These are some tips that worked for me.\n\n* Good jewelry: Having nice jewelry automatically makes a person look more elevated and stylish.  I started investing in good quality fine jewelry and found that I just feel prettier when I'm wearing my earring and ring stacks.  I've been loving The Last Line, Broken English, and Goop. They're very expensive but very worth it as I'm planning to wear this jewelry for a long time. I'm also a fan of the way they style their pieces so I use their e-commerce photos as inspo when I can't afford certain things.\n* Replacing old wardrobe favorites with higher quality versions: I've been going through my closet and replacing well-loved items that I know I look good in with higher quality and more mature versions of it. This is a good tip for those who already know what looks good on them.  It's an easy way to look more polished and has been helpful as I'm transitioning out of college and into adulthood.\n* Good shoes: Invest in your footwear. Shoes are what makes or breaks and outfit so if you're going to splurge on anything it should be shoes. I like to go for classic styles with interesting details that spice up an otherwise plain outfit.\n\nI was able to implement all these changes over the course of a year and felt that they really paid off. Some of these pointers may be obvious or redundant but I wanted to share some of the things that worked for me.  I would really love to hear some things that other Splendida members have done to take their their appearance to the next level!\n\nEdit: added link to pdfs in post as well!\n\n[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-X7CvD5lRTsXPQ6n5TcKCbTceGK2HuUD?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-X7CvD5lRTsXPQ6n5TcKCbTceGK2HuUD?usp=sharing)",

Start looking into what that is and how it affects hair. DHT blocking shampoos/conditioners can help (WowScience makes some great ones that work and dont smell horrid). Also onion juice and cedarwood essential oil does wonders for \"waking up\" sleeping/inactive hair follicles. \n\nPeople don't realize that female pattern baldness is just as common as it is for men.

On the flip side I wouldn't want to spend money trying various products if all along it was down to a common deficiency that's easily treatable.\n\nIf you end up discovering an iron deficiency, \"iron bisglycinate\" is the ideal form of iron to take. Most doctors end up prescribing the cheaper form of iron called Ferrous Sulfate which doesn't absorb well in the stomach and causes side effects like constipation. As a result, people don't see results with their hair. I was one of them until I switched. \n\nHonestly I'd recommend taking it anyway if your iron level is anywhere close to low. Especially if you're having trouble finding the time to eat adequately which certainly raises your risk for a deficiency.\n\nFor me I've had two instances of hair loss in my life. Once was down to iron deficiency, the other time was a rare medication side effect from a blood thinner. If you happen to be on medications for anything, look up the side effects to rule that out too.\n\nIf you don't have health insurance, there are at-home tests for low iron that you can buy online.

While we’re on the topic, there is a difference between hair loss and hair shedding. \n\n hair shedding—or temporarily losing a little more hair than usualis completely normal, and usually occurs after a major life stressor or body change, like losing 20 pounds or more, giving birth, having a high fever, going off birth control pills, or caregiving for a loved one. Excessive hair shedding usually lasts for six to nine months, and then your hair growth and hair loss returns to normal levels.\n\nHair loss, on the other hand, is when something happens that actually stops your hair from growing. Examples of this include hereditary hair loss, losing hair because of a medication like chemotherapy, using harsh hair care products, or having a compulsion to pull out your own hair. In these cases, the hair will not regrow until the cause stops—though that’s not possible in every case (i.e., if genetics are to blame).",

It honestly never bothered me too much because I still had good density at the front of my hair and I was able to camouflage the receding areas well. Fast forward to May of this year and I noticed for the first time how much hair I was shedding. When I was styling my hair after I showered I would be looking at 50 hairs in the sink each time. I monitored my shedding for the next couple months and nothing got better. \n\nI decided to start the minoxidil foam and micro needling at the beginning of august this year. After about 2 weeks my shedding got horrendous. I would run my hand through my hair and have 4-6 hair in-between my fingers every time. There was a time where I kept running my hands through my hair in hopes the shedding would stop and I pulled out close to 100 hairs in just the 5 minutes till I stopped cos I couldn’t believe how bad it was. I noticed a visible decrease in my hairs density over this time. It was mentally tough because I started treatment to stop the shedding and it only increased it. \n\nThe shedding continued for close to 2 months, never quite as bad as that one day where I pulled out 100 hairs in 5 minutes but definitely not great. I researched online and it said to keep with the procedure and shedding is to be expected in some cases. \n\nAt about 2.5 months after starting I noticed the shedding decrease dramatically. Where I was shedding 50 hairs when styling my hair after the shower there is only like 10 ish now. I know shedding will always happen, I just don’t want it to be at the quantity I was experiencing before. \n\nNow at the 3 month mark I’m very happy with my results! My temples have noticeably started to fill in. I can see a good line a baby hairs of where my hairline used to be when I was 18. I honestly started the treatment to keep the density in my hair, the receding honestly didn’t bother me. But now I can seen my dead areas come back to life I couldn’t be happier. \n\nI am going to probably start fin in order to keep my results pretty soon, but I wanted to share my story to help other young guys to get started on treatment soon. When I went to my family doctor in the months before starting treatment telling him I was seeing noticeable shedding he brushed me off and told me I was over reacting. If you notice receding start treatment! \n\nThe photos are my monthly progress. It shows the start of august (no treatment up until then), start of September, start of October, and now close to the end of October!",

Low quality fish oil may increase your risk of prostate cancer. \n\n2. Costco makes a good Calcium/Vid D/Magnesium/zinc combo pill.  Vitamin D deficiency is alarmingly common. And if you are going to take vitamin D you may as well take calcium too, especially if you are a woman. Mg and Zn are bonuses. \n\n3.

This is a BIG factor in nail strength. \n\nAnd a comment - for me personally, an element of weak nails that flake and break easily was having an under active thyroid. This was greatly improved when I started medication, but the other major improvement was ceasing to use my nails as tools. \n\nWhen I clean my face, I also use a facial oil at the end, which I also rub into my cuticles.

Wearing nail strengthener whenever I’m not wearing polish \n3. Drinking protein powder everyday \n4. Avoid getting alcohol on my nails at work (Tbh I think this is the #1 culprit, I recall that a few weeks ago after I scrubbed a patient, my nail polish literally shrank and peeled upwards at the edges! It can’t be the only reason though, because it happened when I had a different role at work as well) \n5. Make sure I’m taking iron everyday \n6. Start taking a B12/D3 supplement again \n7. Removing nail polish the night before reapplying, sleeping with lots of jojoba oil on, and then trimming/filing and reapplying the next day (to avoid drying my nails, and to avoid trimming/shaping damp nails) \n\nI will hopefully post an update in a couple months!",

I wash my hair one time a week, no highend products. Before I shower I always either oil it or make a diy mask with natural ingredients. Biggest gamechanger for me was little to no heat, and when I flat iron I always spray lots and lots of heat protectant and let that dry. Then I’ll go for lower temperatures. So happy its healthier now, my hair adds so much to my confidence!",

        "body": "Okay since everyone asking for a detailed hair routine, here it is:\nI‘ll start pre wash. I wash my hair once a week. Before I hop in the shower I do some kind of oil treatment. I just use whatever oils I have on hand, mostly argan, jojoba, coconut, olive, grapeseed oil. I add some drops of tea tree oil because it helps with my dandruff. Warm that mixture up then apply it on my scalp and a little on the ends. Massage for a bit, put on a heat cap and let that sit for an hour so. \n\nIn the shower first thing I‘ll use a deep cleansing shampoo every 2-3 weeks. The one I use is from L‘oreal, its good, but there a lot of good deep cleansing shampoos on the market. Highly recommend that step if you hair tends to get dirty due the use of styling products, oiling or dandruff. It just gets rid of everything and leaves a clean base for a nutritious shampoo and conditioner. For those I just use something that looked appealing to me at the drugstore, mostly a L‘oreal or Garnier one thats for dry hair. I know thats not the best, rather use kerastase or something but i‘m a broke uni student haha. And tbh it works just fine for me. So i‘ll shampoo another time after the deep cleansing then conditioner, then hair mask. I like to shower my body really hot so I make sure only lukewarm water touches my hair.\n\nWhen I get out of the shower I put it in a tshirt or a cotton scarf/cloth. Since my hair would take 1,5 days to dry completely I blow dry it after a few hours on low temperature. Use heat protectant beforehand. Then use heat procectant again and straighten it on 170°c. When im finished I apply some oil on my ends for extra shine. Hope thats kinda helpful, still on my haircare journey and figuring things out and love learning new things on this sub❤️",

    "body": "F39 5ft1. Hw 228, sw212, cw 112\n\nDiagnosed with kidney disease in Sept. 2021. On track to be on dialysis in 2 years. Started Oz in Nov, ‘21 because of obesity, ckd, and suspected metabolic disorder. \n\nBeen heavy since puberty- weight watchers (the first time) at 13 and I’ve tried diets, calorie counting, meds, exercise- nothing made much of a difference. Even at my healthiest, I was obese. \n\nI was a hyper responder and started losing right away and never plateaued. Only went up to 1.0 and lost the weight in about a year. \n\nChanged my diet but no calorie counting. I don’t drink, eat red meat or pork, eat fast food and rarely eat fried food. On Oz, portion size changed dramatically and my adhd cravings for carbs and sugars vanished. Actually struggled to get calories and added boost high protein shakes to most days for a whole. \n\nSide effects- nausea for 6 months. I made it worse by assuming it was normal. Increased my hydration and for a script for Zofran and that helped. Silent acid- fixed with Prilosec. \n\nI did lose hair- my doc ran bloods and said that hair loss is usually not because of a protein or vitamin issue but that weight loss is a shock to the body that interrupts the hair growth cycle. When it kicks back in, the little baby hairs below the skin push out the old long hairs. Doc had me add D3 and biotin to encourage regrowth. \n\nI do have loose skin. Inevitable when you lose that much weight. How much it goes back is mostly based on how much you lose, age, genetics, and luck. Doc said to give it 2 years before considering surgery. \n\nNot a lot of vanity money but will likely consider a breast lift down the line. I don’t mind smaller but tmi, they look like hanging socks with tennis balls, lol. \n\nFor exercise, bc of the adhd, I’m not great at self motivation. So I fixed my budget and hired a trainer. Started with one day a week and the nausea made it rough! It got better though and now I lift 4x a week and am even considering competition- eek!  \n\nBeen on a maintenance dose of .5 every 10 days for 8 months with no gain. I have an appetite but it’s under control and easy to push away things when I’m full. A pint of ice cream that I could eat in a sitting now lasts 3-4 days. \n\nGot to my maint dose by dropping first to .5 every 7. Wanted to retain the max meds but stop losing. My doc and I set a hard stop and if I hit that number or bmi, we were reducing the dose. Moved to .5 every 10 and that seems to be the magic number. If I lost still, it’d probably go .25 every 7, then .25 every 10. \n\nNo one’s journey on these meds is the same and losing 47% of your starting weight is NOT typical. Clearly this med fixed something the others didn’t- my out of whack hormones. Planning on being on this for life because if I go off, my hormones go back to how they were before. \n\nLucky to have an amazing doctor- we do bloodwork and check ins every 3 months. I also have good insurance (had to get a PA to stay on the maintenance dose though)\n\nHappy to answer questions about my experience. Going to cross post this as well on a couple other subs in case my experience might help others along the way.",

You may remember me from my prior post “[A Comprehensive Guide to Hyperpigmentation and How to Treat it.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/13wsdpz/misc_a_comprehensive_guide_to_hyperpigmentation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) I am back again with another comprehensive guide, this time on another skincare concern that I often see in skin-subs which is some version of the question “why do I have **chin/jawline acne** and how do I deal with it?” Now, you may be wondering why I’m choosing to hyper focus on one particular area of the face. You see, our chins are actually very unique environments which results in a really specific type of acne with very specific causes and treatments. Some people will have acne everywhere on their faces and bodies but some people will frustratingly develop persistent acne on just their chins and jaws. This post is specifically intended as a resource for people who find that their primary location of persistent breakouts is on their chin.\n\nAs it so happens, I also suffered from seemingly treatment resistant chin acne and I set out to figure out a way to solve it with years of research, trial and error, testing, talking to dermatologists and professionals, and scouring every medical article I could get my hands on. I wanted to share my findings and research since this is a common concern. I hope this resource is helpful!\n\n**DISCLAIMERS:**\n\n* Acne is an incredibly diverse condition with many causes and treatment courses and will always be unique to the individual struggling with it. While I will do my best to be as thorough as possible in my explanations and recommendations, it’s both possible and likely that I’m not able to detail every circumstance resulting in your personal case. This is meant to be a high level guide to serve as a jumping off point. \n* Speaking about acne requires sensitivity to very real personal implications. This post is not intended to moralize or act as a judgment of anyone struggling with acne. It is not a commentary on anyone’s personal hygiene, hormone profile, lifestyle, or environment. \n* There are a few conditions that can present similarly to acne present on the chin such as rosacea, perioral dermatitis, herpes simplex, allergies and autoimmune conditions, impetigo, hand foot and mouth disease, staph, and others. These will not respond to the same treatments as acne and should be addressed by a medical professional to properly diagnose and create a treatment plan for.\n* Shaving may also cause acne-like legions, but these are the result of irritation and ingrown hairs that also will not respond to the same treatment as acne. I will write a separate post on shaving in the near future to hopefully address these.\n* I do repeat myself a few times in here but that is for people who are skipping around the article. I want to be as thorough as possible even if you're jumping to the parts of the post you need.\n* I do run an online dermatology practice and skin care consultancy, but in order to protect the integrity of my advice, I do not promote my business, I don't give direct medical advice, I don't link to any products/websites, and I don't promote any products I've formulated myself. In spite of this being a heavily researched piece, please bear in mind that it also at its core an opinion piece. I also did not utilize AI for any portion of this post.\n\nThis is going to get long because I wanted to cover everything re:chin and jawline acne. But for your reading pleasure and ease, I have divided this post up so you can get whatever information you need:\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n1. Types of Chin Acne\n2. What Causes Chin Acne aka Why is This Area Unique?\n3. What Exactly is Hormonal Acne and Why Does it Affect My Chin?\n4. How To Treat Chin Acne Part 1: The Ingredients\n5. How to Treat Chin Acne Part 2: The Routine and Recommendations\n6. “I’ve Gone Too Far With the Actives” \n7. Is it Fungal Acne?\n8. Nuclear Options\n\nLet's get to it!\n\n\n\n# 1. Types of Chin Acne\n\n  \nLike acne that appears on other areas of the face and body, chin acne can take a few different forms. Knowing the types of acne breakouts can help you understand the underlying causes and is key to figuring out how to treat them.\n\n**Blackheads:** Blackheads happen when your pores become partially clogged and the trapped debris oxidizes to a dark brown/black color. Because the top of the pore remains open, blackheads are known as “open comedones.”\n\n**Whiteheads:** Whiteheads happen when your pores become clogged all the way through causing a small white bump at the top. Whiteheads are known as “closed comedones” as the pore is completely blocked by debris. These are generally very small.\n\n**Papules:** Papules are raised red bumps that form when oil, dirt or excess skin cells block a pore and mix with bacteria on your skin. This bacterial infection extends into the surrounding skin creating an inflamed legion. Papules do not contain pus, thus they don’t really form a white point like you see with whiteheads or pustules.\n\n**Pustules:** Pustules are raised bumps with a white center surrounded by red, inflamed skin. They’re like the 2.0 version of a whitehead. They form when a pore becomes blocked by oil, dirt, or dead skin cells and gets infected to the point of creating a yellowish/white pus that’s visible under the skin, sometimes coming to a distinct peak. \n\n**Nodules:** Nodular acne occurs very deep within the skin. They can produce red or flesh-colored bumps at the surface, but they frustratingly may not appear to come to a definitive point. They are hard to the touch and are caused when the deepest part of a clogged pore gets infected. Nodular acne feels sore, or like there is a pressure under the skin.\n\n**Cystic:** Cystic acne, also known as acne cysts or blind pimples, are large, painful, pus-filled clogged pores that have become infected. They may not come to a definitive point on the surface and are fairly soft to the touch. They develop deep in the skin but create a red appearance at the surface. Like nodular acne, they often feel like a sore pressure point, but it’s difficult to really see where they are because they don’t form a peak or point, just an amorphous bump. \n\n\n\n# 2. What Causes Chin Acne aka Why is This Area Unique?\n\nThere are a number of factors that can contribute to the formation of chin and jawline acne, but this is a very unique spot which is worth discussing in detail. Generally, acne forms as a the result of a combination of bodily and environmental factors, but the chin and jawline have a few things going on that makes this area particularly interesting.\n\nFirst, I want to quickly discuss what causes acne to form in general:\n\n**Oil Production:** Oil on the skin, also known as sebum is the primary variable in the great equation of acne formation. Oil production is largely influenced by genetics, but it can be triggered by exposure to certain environmental factors. Many types of acne form around sebum that’s produced and then trapped in pores when combined with other things like dead skin cells, bacteria, and dirt. Sebum in an of itself is not bad, in fact it’s essential to maintaining the health of your skin, but preventing it from combining with acne-causing bacteria is key.\n\n**Comedogenic Reactions:** When sebum combines with other gunk, especially stuff that’s non water soluble, pores will sometimes clog. A comedogenic reaction is when a pore becomes blocked as a result of the accumulation of materials that cannot easily be cleared. This can happen with natural “gunk” like dead skin cells and environmental grime, but it can also happen with products that we apply to our skin such as skincare, makeup, SPF, and in some cases our hair products. Side note on this, there isn’t a generally accepted scale of comedogenic reactivity even though there are claims of one existing. Everyone is different, and certain things may trigger a comedogenic reaction in one person but not another. \n\n**Bacteria:** When bacteria enters the picture, clogged pores can go from simply being blocked to infected. This infection will trigger an immune response from the body, usually resulting in inflammation, redness, pain, and in some cases the production of pus. This is the difference between black/whiteheads and pimples/nodules/cysts. \n\n**Genetics:** Your genetics can greatly influence how prone you are to acne, what type, and at what severity. Genetics will predetermine certain aspects of your skin such as: \n\n* The size of your pores and how prone they are to blockage\n* Your natural level of sebum production \n* The rate at which you shed old/dead skin cells and replace them with new ones \n* Your hormonal levels and sensitivity to them\n* If you will have an allergic or inflammatory response when exposed to certain stressors, ingredients, or environmental factors\n\n**Skin Barrier Disruption:** Acne that forms as a result of skin barrier disruption is a form of an inflammatory reaction. Skin barrier disruption can occur when skin is exposed to environmental factors such as extreme heat or cold, dry air, wind, or pollution. It can also occur due to exposure to too many active or drying ingredients such as chemical/manual exfoliants, antioxidants, antiseptics, etc. \n\nExcessive exposure to these environmental factors and/or active ingredients can irritate and inflame the skin, disrupting the pH, triggering an immune reaction that results in pain, redness, and swelling. When the skin barrier is disrupted in this manner, it will often produce excess sebum in an attempt to moisturize the skin and rebalance its pH. During this time, the skin is less able to stave off bacteria and other environmental stressors which often mix with this excess sebum resulting in acne and breakouts. \n\n**Diet:** There is a great deal of controversy as to whether or not diet contributes to acne. It’s possible that foods themselves may cause acne through skin contact (more on that right below) and it’s possible that your body may react in certain ways that can trigger acne when certain foods are consumed, such as an inflammatory response or as a response to something like hormones in dairy products. Whether or not certain foods contribute to acne can be a purely personal experience. There’s no single body of research that can tell us one way or the other, many studies are conflicting, and it’s very difficult to objectively test when everyone’s own experience seems to differ.\n\n**B Vitamin Breakouts:** Now, there isn’t an established clinical consensus on this either, but there’s anecdotal evidence to suggest that certain B vitamins contribute to acne by possibly promoting sebum production. These include things like B12, biotin, and B complexes that can appear in multivitamins and in supplements that are marketed for promoting “hair, skin and nail health.” There’s also no clinical evidence to suggest a direct link between B vitamins and skin/hair/nail health except for the operating theory that in increasing sebum production, they promote healthy development in these areas, but for people who are prone to acne, it also seems to trigger breakouts. This isn’t unique to just the chin area, but it may be worth evaluating your supplements if you’re finding an increase in acne with use of supplements that feature B vitamins. \n\n**Hormones:** This gets its own section….\n\n  \n**But why my chin/jaw** ***specifically*****??**\n\nFor people who struggle with acne on just their chin or jawline, this is a really common question, and the answer is part of the reason I believe it requires a unique approach to treating. Chin acne is the result of two things:\n\n**Gravity and Proximity to Your Mouth:** All the time we spend upright means that stuff on the surface of our skin will migrate downward over the course of the day. Now this is true for other areas of your face, sometimes our hair products migrate down to our foreheads, our eye makeup onto our cheeks. But what makes the chin particularly problematic for acne is not only do we have this drift of face stuff to this area, we also have our mouths. \n\nOur mouths are full of bacteria, and even if you don’t spend all day drooling on yourself, that bacteria can spread downward as a result of talking, laughing, coughing, sneezing, licking our lips, even just normal breathing. *Propionibacterium* *acnes* and *staphylococcus* *epidermidis* are bacteria that can originate in the mouth and migrate outward and downward causing acne legions. To a lesser extent, we also see some bacterial transfer from the hands as the chin/jawline tend to be high touch points.\n\nOur mouths are also where we eat. Even if you’re the most careful eater in the world, many times you’ll get some degree of food debris on your chin. Even though I just mentioned that there’s no general consensus on whether or not diet contributes to acne, it’s possible that the act of putting food in our mouths can; that getting even trace amounts of stuff like grease and sugar on the skin around our mouth can contribute to clogged pores and bacterial proliferation. \n\n\n\n# 3. What Exactly is Hormonal Acne and Why Does it Affect My Chin?\n\nEveryone’s biological processes are dictated in part by the influence of hormones in our system, but the link between hormones and acne isn’t as simple as “I have hormones, *ergo* I have acne.” Understanding the environment in which hormones contribute to the formation of acne can help us with more realistic treatments than just “stop the hormones.”\n\nThe reason hormones cause acne is that androgen hormones (aka male hormones like testosterone, DHEAS, DHEA, and androstenedione) influence the production of sebum in the skin: it increases as they go up, and decreases as they go down. A breakdown of the actual process is as follows:\n\n1. Oil producing sebaceous glands are powerful androgen receptors, producing more sebum when they collect more androgen hormones or convert their precursors. This causes oil production on skin and a build up of that sebum in the pores. \n2. Androgens themselves may also clog pores causing comedones to be formed.\n3. DHEAS is also inflammatory by nature, triggering immune response T cells to show up in and around clogged pores.\n\nThe levels of these androgen hormones can be globally elevated (as is the case with PCOS in females or generally for males with high testosterone naturally or supplemented, hence backne with steroid use) or they can fluctuate. This is why women sometimes breakout during their periods: it’s the downstream effect of elevated androgen hormones in the luteal phase when estrogen and progesterone naturally decrease. \n\nAs mentioned prior, B vitamins can also have this effect by triggering androgen receptors even though they themselves are not androgen hormones or their precursors. \n\nDue to the aforementioned reasons as to why the chin in particular is an area where we find the best ingredients for acne, we can see why increased sebum production from elevated androgens would result in breakouts there. Now, the knee jerk reaction may be to stop or reduce those hormones — and there are ways to do that such as using/stopping birth control pills or other forms of hormone replacement or suppression — but while these may work as an acne treatment, it’s an option you should only discuss with your doctor if appropriate for you.\n\nThere are other ways to address hormonal causes of acne such as the medication spironolactone or spearmint herbal tea. Spiro is a diuretic that’s been proven to block androgen receptors and spearmint is thought to have a similar effect but I have yet to find a study specifically supporting this, at least not to the rigor I would like to recommend this in earnest. \n\nGenerally, for those who either can’t or don’t want to use interventions that affect their hormone profiles or take androgen blocking medications, the most reasonable intervention is to temper the environment in which acne forms on the skin through the use of topicals and skin care. The reason I mention all of this is to pull back the curtain on what exactly “hormonal acne” means so you can address the resulting sebum that’s ultimately forming acne legions. This is where we look at the ingredients specifically proven to address the environment on your skin.\n\n\n\n# 4. How to Treat Chin Acne Part 1: The Ingredients\n\nWhen looking for skincare products to treat and prevent chin and jawline acne, it’s important to look for ingredients that can help encourage skin cell turnover, curb sebum production, kill off acne-causing bacteria, clear clogged pores, and block harmful UV rays. \n\nNow, this is not actually as extensive of a list as you might expect. There are lots of ingredients that target acne, including new and novel ones coming onto the market all the time. I’m choosing to focus on ones that are clinically studied and have the most compelling evidence, ones that have worked the best for myself and people that I’ve worked with, recommendations from dermatologists and formulators, and ones that are more readily accessible. I also find that having a consistent routine that includes proper cleansing is just as important as what you're using, as well as limiting the number of topicals to prevent the dreaded moisture barrier disruption which can have a backfire effect. \n\nThis also isn’t a shopping list. You don’t have to have or use all of these things to treat chin acne, but I’ll get into that in the routine portion. This is more to be used as a tool that can help you diversify your routine if you find one ingredient or another doesn't work for you. And it can help you determine if a product targets acne based on its ingredients. There's lot's of options. Some of the key ingredients to look for include:\n\n**Retinoids** that increases cell turnover. Retinoids like tretinoin, adapalene, retinol et al, can help treat chin and jawline acne by promoting the turnover of skin cells and increasing cell growth, which can help prevent dead skin cells from clogging pores. While retinoids are extremely effective, they do have some caveats. First, they can be sensitizing to a lot of users, but this can be tempered by using different form functions, different application methods, or different concentrations. Second, because it's constantly turning over skin exposing delicate new skin cells to the elements, it can actually worsen acne if you overdo it and damage your skin barrier. Lastly Tretinoin and other retinoids are firewalled behind a prescription in some countries and may be more difficult to obtain. But retinol/al is available in OTC forms.\n\n**Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs)** are water-soluble chemical exfoliants. Solubility of skincare ingredients matters because the natural moisturizer of the skin is our sebum, which is oil. Water-soluble ingredients don’t dissolve in oil, thus they do not penetrate into the pores as deeply. This, however, is not actually a downside, it means that these types of ingredients work on the top layers of the skin which is great for acne. Common AHAs that are used to fight acne include glycolic acid, lactic acid, and mandelic acid. There are numerous others, but these are the most promising and well-researched. Use of AHAs helps breakup and remove dead skin cells which prevents them from clogging pores. And while pore size cannot be reduced, AHAs can help reduce the dilation that happens when pores fill up with gunk.  \n\n**Beta Hydroxy Acid (BHA)** is an oil-soluble chemical exfoliant, the most well known of which is salicylic acid. Remember Stridex pads? Those are salicylic acid! Because BHA is oil-soluble, it dissolves in the skin’s natural sebum which pulls it deeper into the pores. This causes deeper exfoliation which makes this an effective ingredient for combatting deeper forms of acne. The caveat is, since it works in deeper levels, the risk of irritation is higher. But when carefully used especially when featured in cleansers, BHA is a very effective method of treating and preventing acne.\n\n**Azelaic Acid** has both anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties making this one of my all around favorite skincare ingredients due to it’s ability to both kill off acne-causing bacteria as well as reduce redness and acne scarring. It’s also a mild chemical exfoliant that helps strip away dead skin cells much like AHAs and BHAs. It's pretty awesome and available in OTC and prescription strengths.\n\n**Niacinamide or Vitamin B3** is a skin soother that decreases inflammation, but its real power is that it naturally reduces sebum production which can curb acne. It works by inhibiting the enzyme “sebaceous lipase” which is part of the process of oil production in the pores. Ironically, it’s a form of vitamin B3, but unlike ingested B vitamins that might trigger acne, as a topical it actually helps prevent acne. Like AHAs/BHA it can also reduce the dilation of pores which can make them appear smaller. Now, there are some people who are sensitive to niacinamide. I cannot find any studies to support why this may be, or if perhaps people are reacting to other ingredients in products that contain it, but if you find you do not tolerate niacinamide well, it’s best to skip it.\n\n**Benzoyl Peroxide** is an antiseptic which means it makes the environment incredibly inhospitable for bacterial proliferation. Unlike antibiotics that kill bacteria (which can contribute to antibiotic resistance), benzoyl peroxide as an antiseptic simply makes life miserable for bacteria so they fail to thrive and cause acne. Benzoyl peroxide is usually found in two forms, either as a leave-on topical or in face washes. Like many of the other ingredients listed here, it can be sensitizing with overuse, and in the leave-on form, it can sometimes bleach your clothes, but it’s an incredibly effective way to curb the proliferation of bacteria on the chin. It’s also one of the active ingredients in prescription Epiduo or Epiduo forte, which is compounded benzoyl peroxide and the retinoid adapalene. Benzoyl peroxide is generally available in concentrations of 5 and 10%. \n\n**Sulphur** is…. Sulphur. It does a couple things (other than stinking) when applied to treat acne. It helps absorb excess oil, it dries out dead skin cells to make them easier to clear away, it has some antiseptic properties especially against chin-loving *propionibacterium* *acnes*, and it’s also a mild exfoliant. It comes in two forms usually, as a face wash or as a leave-on mask or spot treatment. This can be a good substitute for benzoyl peroxide. Sulphur allergies or sensitivities are common, so it’s important to check for any reactivity you might have.\n\n**SPF** represents a class of many ingredients designed to protect the skin from UV rays and the damage that occurs from exposure. This doesn’t necessarily have an effect on preventing chin acne, but it is necessary to use when using active ingredients to fight acne. Just use it.\n\n\n\n# 5. How to Treat Chin Acne Part 2: The Routine and Recommendations\n\nAlright, let’s get to it. I’m providing two paths to take: a gentler option for more sensitive skin and a heavier-hitting option if your skin is more resilient to actives. But first, irrespective of your skin, there’s one really important part of the routine worth exploring if you suffer with chin and jawline acne which is getting your oral health dialed.\n\nI discovered this accidentally and then was able to later confirm with a dermatologist and dentist that the effect here can be real. A few years ago I decided to do Invisalign and I actually noticed my chin breakouts reduced significantly in part because I was brushing my teeth, flossing, and rinsing with mouthwash as much as 10 times per day depending on how often I was drinking or eating.\n\nNow, you don’t need to be doing that quite as often, but what I’ve found to be effective against chin acne is the following:\n\n**In the morning:**\n\n1. Scrape your tongue using a tongue scraper.\n2. Rinse and gargle with a mouthwash of your choosing and wait 5 or 10 minutes. This is a good time to do your skincare. I personally like CloSYS mouthwash.\n3. Brush your teeth but don’t rinse with water and avoid eating or drinking for a little while.\n\n**Throughout the day:**\n\n1. Keep a little travel bottle of mouthwash with you and if you can, swish a little after anytime you eat or drink (anything that isn’t just plain flat water.) This helps curb some of that bacteria that likes to meander out of your mouth and onto your chin. I have a 3oz refillable bottle that I fill every few days and just keep it in my bag.\n2. If you’re not able to rinse with mouthwash, swish your mouth with plain, flat water after eating or drinking. This helps clear away food/drink residue that oral bacteria proliferate in. \n\n**In the evening:**\n\n1. Scrape your tongue.\n2. Floss, and really get in there. SO many people don’t floss thoroughly enough. Many of the bacteria associated with chin acne are elevated in people with gum disease. \n3. Rinse and gargle with your mouthwash. Wait 5 to 10 minutes, again this is a great time to do your skincare. \n4. Brush your teeth and again, don’t rinse with water after.\n\nIf you can stick with an oral hygiene routine like this, for a lot of people struggling with chin acne, it’s half the battle. And I know it might seem obvious, like “of course I brush my teeth!!!” but adding maintenance steps through the day and *really flossing* are two of the biggest parts that plenty of people fail to do regularly. These are also great steps to take if you f\\*cking hate getting manhandled at the dentist.\n\nNow let’s talk about the actual skincare portion. Since this is targeted, you can apply the actives to just your chin area or your whole face if you would like. It’s up to you. Just be sure you get thorough coverage of your whole face when cleansing, moisturizing, and applying SPF.\n\n\n\n# The Gentle Routine\n\n**AM routine — In order of application following a lukewarm water rinse:**\n\n1: Niacinamide\\*\\*\n\n2: Azelaic acid\n\n3: Moisturizer\n\n4: SPF\n\n\n\n**For Niacinamide,** I have been extremely happy with the Ordinary’s Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%. \\*\\***If you can’t tolerate niacinamide**, you can skip this step and instead use **Effaclar Mat Oil-Free Mattifying Moisturizer from La Roche Posay** as your moisturizer step.\n\n**For Azelaic acid,** Paula's choice Azelaic Acid Booster is the only drugstore one I've really tried after sampling the Ordinary's in-store and not liking the texture. For a semi-RX, Dermatica has both a 15 and 20% “Clarifying Azelaic Acid Cream” which can be purchased directly from their site. \n\n**For Moisturizer,** it’s tempting to go with one formulated for acne or oil control, but I generally recommend a light and sheer moisturizer. I really like Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion (the one for face and body). If you need a niacinamide(B3)-free option Vanicream Daily Facial Moisturizer is a good option.\n\n**For SPF,** I personally like anything from La Roche Posay, any Neutrogena SPF that's not formulated with ethylhexylglycerin as this can be sensitizing for some, Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen, Trader Joe's SPF if you can get your hands on it, and EltaMD. Find one that you like and that you will wear.\n\n\n\n**PM routine: In order of application:**\n\n1: Gentle cleanse\n\n2a: Adapalene (Mon/Wed/Fri, start with 1x per week and build to 3x)\n\n2b: AHA (Sun) \n\n3: Moisturizer  \n\n\n**To Gentle Cleanse**, this is a two-step process. Start with Cetaphil gentle cleanser. This is a gentle, hydrating cleanser that will break up your SPF really effectively. Massage in and rinse. If you need something a little stronger to breakup makeup or more stubborn SPF, Clinique “Take the Day Off” makeup remover is a great alternative. Then massage in a foaming cleanser, I recommend Cetaphil daily cleanser, and rinse.\n\n**For Adapalene**, OTC Differin cream is the one you’re going to want to go with as it’s the easiest prescription-strength retinoid to get without seeing a doctor. Apply a pea-sized amount. Oddly enough, of all the retinoids I’ve tried, my chin acne has responded the most to adapalene. I like to start people at once a week and build to 3 times per week, up to daily if you can tolerate it. If you’re using the AHA next step though, keep at least one day adapalene-free so you can also have an exfoliation day.\n\n**For AHA,** the one I like to go with that provides gentle, yet effective exfoliation is lactic acid. Lactic acid also binds to water which makes it a really good hydrating ingredient as well. The Ordinary’s Lactic Acid + HA in either 5 or 10% is a good one.   \n\n\n# The Heavier-Hitting Routine\n\n**AM routine — This will be the same as the AM portion of the gentle routine, no need to go crazy. Pop back up there for that.**\n\n**PM routine: In order of application:**\n\n1: Benzoyl peroxide cleanse\n\n2a: Adapalene (Mon/Wed/Fri, start with 1x per week and build to 3x)\n\n2b: BHA (Sun)\n\n3: Moisturizer\n\n\n\nThis might not seem terribly different from the Gentle Routine, but both benzoyl peroxide cleansing and the introduction of a BHA can be particularly a\\*s kicking if your skin isn’t ready for it.\n\n**For Benzoyl Peroxide Cleanser,** first you will do a gentle cleanse with Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser to breakup your SPF and do a first pass on your skin. Massage in and rinse completely, then follow with Differin Daily Deep Cleanser. Depending on your tolerance, you can rinse this off right after massaging into skin, or you can let it sit for a few minutes (3 at the most) before rinsing. If you find your skin getting really irritated by this, switch to the gentle routine. \n\n**For Adapalene**, OTC Differin cream will work here, just like in the gentle routine.\n\n**For a BHA**, also called salicylic acid, there are a couple options I like. Paula’s Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant or the Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Solution are great options. This can be very sensitizing though, especially in a routine that includes a retinoid so only use once or twice per week and not on the same night as your adapalene.\n\n\n\n# 6. Is it Fungal Acne?\n\nIf the routines don’t seem to be working for you, it’s possible that you may have fungal acne. Fungal acne can show up on your chin for the same reason regular acne can, except instead of being cause by bacteria, it’s caused by an overgrowth of yeast. Fungal acne can have a distinct appearance, it’s similar to whiteheads/closed comedones with small, clustered white or flesh colored bumps, and it might not appear as red and inflamed as pustules/papules. There is some controversy as to whether or not fungal acne is a thing (mostly as a matter of semantics, it’s not technically a form of *Acne vulgaris*, rather *Pityrosporum folliculitis* or *Malassezia folliculitis*), but if you’re not successful with the routines above and you can rule out other medical conditions, it may be worth treating your case like fungal acne.\n\nThe solution to this is a simple one: cleanse your face with an antidandruff shampoo a few times per week —Head and Shoulder, Selsun Blue, Nizoral are great ones. Let it sit on your skin for a few minutes before rinsing, then top with a basic moisturizer. If you have a combination of fungal and regular acne, you can do this as your cleansing step a few times per week with the rest of the steps in the routine. If you just have fungal acne, you can literally just do this and follow with your moisturizer and SPF during the day. If it persists, talk to your doctor about a prescription anti-fungal.\n\n\n\n# 7. “I’ve Gone Too Far With the Actives” \n\nIt’s tempting to go nuts with the actives in an attempt to quickly stave off chin acne, but this can cause severe irritation that can actually contribute to more breakouts. The skin cell turnover cycle is about 30 days which means that it will generally take a few weeks to start seeing improvements with a new routine. Most people will know if a routine is working within 3 to 6 months, but a quick way to know if it’s not working because you’ve overdone it is if you experience a damaged moisture barrier which can happen as quickly as within a few days.\n\nA damaged moisture barrier is an injury to the skin that can be caused by using too many actives and is akin to a chemical burn. There are a few telltale ways to know if this is happened: first, the skin will have a really distinct feel. It will feel tight and dry, but confusingly, it may be very oily at the same time. It may also appear red and inflamed, it may peel or appear to crack, and it may burn, itch, or sting even when you apply inert topicals like a basic moisturizer. \n\nThe confounding thing is that in this state, your skin will produce more oil to try to calm everything down, but because the immune system is working on healing the damaged skin, it’s less able to stave off acne causing bacteria. So not only are you very uncomfortable and inflamed, you’re also probably going to have more breakouts. Healing acne means striking a gentle balance with your actives, but if you find that you have disrupted your moisture barrier, you should pull everything back until it stabilizes. \n\nI recommend dropping your routine down to absolute basics: In the morning, rinse with lukewarm water, use a gentle moisturizer like Cetaphil or Vanicream, and top with SPF. In the evening, double cleanse with Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser and then Cetaphil Daily Cleanser, then top with your moisturizer and/or an occlusive like Vaseline or La Roche Posay Cicaplast Balm. Stick with this until your skin feels normal again, and if you want, very slowly reintroduce your actives, or switch some of the recommended products for others that I’ve mentioned to see if there’s something else you get along with.\n\n\n\n# 8. Nuclear Options\n\nIn general, I recommend trying OTC and drugstore topical solutions for any skin concern before heading down the dermatology route. Part of this is because you can usually put a good dent in what you're struggling with by using OTC topicals, making in-office RX treatments easier and more effective. Generally, a doctor will be able to prescribe prescription-strength versions of many of the things I’ve already listed, or they will add oral medications. But by doing as much as you can with drugstore products AND ensuring you can stick with a consistent routine, you can make the most of your continued work with a dermatology.\n\nSide note: I haven't listed every possible compounded medication because there are a lot, and many compounded meds are formulated to tackle multiple issues. I also tend to favor single note skin care (aka, products with very few ingredients) as this allows you to combine or remove certain actives and gives you a better sense of reactivity. \n\nThis list also doesn’t include hormone-related treatments. If you believe a hormonal intervention is right for you, it’s best to talk to your doctor specifically about your individual needs. \n\nFor tougher-to-treat chin acne, if your topical routine doesn't totally clear the problem in 6 to 8 months, a visit to the dermatologist might be helpful. Here are the heavier-hitting topicals and medications to discuss with a dermatologist that can go the extra mile after you've exhausted other options.\n\n*This does not constitute medical advice, it is intended to act as a guide for you to discuss with your dermatologist or medical provider.*\n\n**Medical Grade Peels:** Medical grade chemical peels can be done in dermatology offices. High concentration BHA or AHA peels are also commonly used for acne. Because of the strength of the acids used, these must be done by a medical professional with careful followup. I recommend this over seeing an esthetician for peels. \n\n**Tretinoin and Prescription Retinoids:** This is going to be dependent on what part of the world you're in, but in a lot of countries, tretinoin and its counterparts like tazarotene are only available through prescription. These would be used in place of the OTC adapalene I mentioned in the routine if prescribed by your provider. There is a stronger prescription-strength adapalene as well as a compounded medication called Epiduo or Epiduo Forte, which combines adapalene with Benzoyl Peroxide. You should be mindful that it can bleach clothes and sheets if you are prescribed it. Aside from the ones already mentioned, common forms of prescription retinoids include: Altreno, Tazorac, Fabior, and Trifarotene (Aklief). They vary wildly in cost in availability so I recommend asking to start with generic options first before asking your doctor for brandname acne medication.\n\n**Prescription Azelaic Acid:** This is another one that's available in lower concentrations over-the-counter (which can still be quite effective) but there are prescription strength grades of azelaic acid such as Finacea and Azelex. This is usually reserved for rosacea treatment as it tends to target redness and flushing, but it can also be an effective acne treatment for its antiseptic properties.\n\n**Topical Antibiotics:** Topical erythromycin and clindamycin can be helpful in killing off acne causing bacteria but you need to be careful of developing antibiotic resistance. I am of the opinion that a topical antibiotic course should not exceed 90 days, but your doctor will know better based on your case. It may be helpful however to ask your doctor exactly how long you should be on a topical antibiotic, how you will know if it’s working, if they have a plan for you to gradually wean off of it, and what their recommendation for replacement would be after you have finished your course. Typically, a doctor will transition you to a topical retinoid or other medication following an antibiotic course. It’s good to have a clear plan prior to starting a topical antibiotic.\n\n**Oral Antibiotics:** Tetracycline antibiotics like doxycycline and minocycline are sometimes prescribed for severe acne cases and are usually the last line of defense before the ultimate treatment which I will get into next. It’s generally recommended to exhaust all other possible topical treatments before turning to this sort of intervention as oral antibiotics can have numerous side effect (such as hyperpigmentation, nausea, severe photo reactivity) and can also contribute to systemic antibiotic resistance. However, short (1 to 3 months) or infrequence courses of oral antibiotics can be effective in treating acne and helping prevent the repopulation of acne-causing bacteria. Like topical antibiotics, it’s important to have a clear plan with your doctor to understand how long you will be on it, how you will know if it’s working, and what you will transition to using after the course is finished. Having a routine to support an oral antibiotic is key to longterm success even after your course is finished.\n\n**Oral Tretinoin:** Also called isotretinoin or accutane, this is the true nuclear option for acne, chin or otherwise. Like its topical counterpart, oral tretinoin works by increasing skin cell turnover. Generally, it’s only used in severe cases as the courses are often long, fraught with side effects, and require lifestyle adjustments such as abstinence from alcohol and regular blood draws for liver enzyme and cholesterol monitoring. However for many people, the side effects are minimal, and the reduction in acne often outweighs the temporary discomfort of the treatment course. Many people can go years or even the rest of their lives without a severe reoccurrence of acne following an oral tretinoin course. \n\n—\n\n**If you made it this far, congratulations! This concludes my comprehensive guide on chin acne. I hope this information is helpful. While it is extensive and based on massive amount of research, experience, experimentation and work with professionals, it may not be perfect and it may not be suitable for everyone. Feel free to offer any constructive criticism or ask any questions in comments. I am always open to expanding my understanding.**",

I'm also fighting against other medication which makes me gain weight.\n\nI stalled at the last week of 2.5 and felt so fucking discouraged. Some weeks, it feels like the scale won't move if I don't eat under what I already set as a minimum. That is teaching my brain that ill only lose if I'm suffering or under eating, which feels like gaining bad habits in the opposite direction if i give into it.\n\nI feel sometimes like my 1lb a week loss is nothing. Comparison truly is the thief of joy.. I genuinely think I'd be able to celebrate my own journey more if I saw other people like me here who arent just posting thei skinny pictures next to versions of my body that i feel im still at, and will never escape. How could *i* possibly look anything like that? It feels impossible even now. \n\nI thought I'd find like minded people on a journey together here, but what it FEELS LIKE at times is a competition. And I'm not winning. like other social media, perhaps more than ever before, it's not encouraging me. Its actually making me feel inferior.\n\nI accept that some of these feelings definitely come from envy, and low self esteem, nevertheless the feelings are happening. \n\nSo. Here i am. I'm losing, even if slowly. I'm doing everything I physically can to support my weight loss. I've stalled once, it looks like this week I miiight stall again. I dont see that i look any different, I don't feel different, I don't enjoy the process, I'll be honest, and it sometimes feels like it will never end. \n\nI tell myself every day it will. I tell myself that it's science and it will eventually pay off with consistency. And I'm going to tell it here, and tell it to you, I'm going to believe it, and I'm going to keep going.\n\nSo here I AM. Not a success story yet. Not fixed, not done, not even close. But its my story. And sure, since it doesn't have some massive dramatic loss pics, it won't be one of these 1k up vote massive loss posts - but it is here to show you my thoughts, my honest, open thoughts this week. And if you're anything like me. Maybe you can feel seen where I currently don't. ♡\n\n\n---------\nEdit : Im ubable to keep up with the outpouring of comments but just know im reading every single one. Thank you for making me feel seen too ♡ ",

I see so many posts about people losing a healthy 1-2lbs a week, or saying the same for several weeks as well as  hundreds of comments on the aforementioned ‘I’m not losing posts’ about a good, steady weight loss. \n\nI would also say that I completely disagree there is anything competitive about this sub. I find it very supportive. \n\nSo as I said, I genuinely believe it’s a perception problem for a number of people. Maybe you need to read more comments and focus on the steady losers not the headline grabbing ones! I have lost a large amount but it has averaged out to just over 2lbs a week and certainly hasn’t been consistent. Patience is the key here.",

But having hung around on here for a few months now, I think I am reading different posts or perhaps just a bit dim because I haven't a clue how fast or slow other people are losing. If I have read posts about 10lbs a month then they must have washed right through my head and been forgotten about because they don't occupy any space at all in my brain. I also don't feel the need to be seen on social media - this journey is a deeply personal one for me and so the only person I care about understanding it, is me. Who cares a monkey's noodle whether some random username on a screen knows how much I've lost or is losing weight faster or slower than me? \n\nIt's possible it's my age. At 45 I had the great fortune to grow into an adult before social media ever came along and, as such, other than a fun distraction, it doesn't hold the same level of judgement for me that I think it must for younger people. It's all a bit daft and surreal, is it not? To care much about something that someone you don't know has typed, without ever really being sure if it's true or not? SM is just a modern day fairy tale, all pictures of happy endings and such that do not show the true spectrum of people's lives which are sometimes happy, sometimes victorious but also sometimes deeply sad, painful and hard.\n\nAnyway, I am not trying to make you feel bad - but just to illustrate that there IS another way of doing this journey and feeling about yourself. One that does not rely on social media for validation or to be seen or for anything other that a trivial distraction that you jump onto while waiting for the kettle to boil :)",

It will show in my clothing and how my posture improves, even if not on the scales!    \n\n\nOne thing I’m not sure about is if you are still on 2.5mg or have moved up each month?  I know you will know that the 2.5mg isn’t necessarily meant for us to lose weight, but for some of us it’s an added bonus. I’ve been upping my dose each month and am now on 10mg.

I may remain on this dose for a while, but if food noise increases, will move up.  \n\nYour feelings are important and we all have them, despite what you may read.

You probably need something for hydration and light definition but anything heavier or stronger is going to leave you weighed down or crunchy. I like the L'Oreal Power Restore treatment (giant tub, can be a leave in or mask) and the Eva NYC Curl Cream (feels thick but is relatively lightweight). Both give me just enough wave/curl definition to hold my together but plaster my hair to my scalp. Curl Smith's Hold Me Softly styler is also really good. \n\nFor washing, shampoo isn't that important IMO as long as it's not a clarifying shampoo every wash. RN I use Olaplex 1 or Apeiu Vinegar shampoo. For conditioner I use a hair mask (yes. Instead of conditioner and each wash). I alternate the Sauce Beauty Guacamole mask and Bleach London's Reincarnation mask. I leave them on for 10min, rinse, then put on my leave in stuff. It's made a big difference in how manageable my hair is and boosted how soft and glossy it is as well.\n\nSkip any brushing or combing when it's dry. If it needs to be detangled you should be using a wide toothed comb or your fingers in the shower. And clarify once a month, sometimes that makes a huge difference in the appearance of your hair just from removing mineral or product buildup.\n\nAlso, any chance you live in a place with high humidity?

When I just started the curly method, I thought it wasn't gonna work out because products just made my hair heavy and greasy. But then I tried gels and they changed my mind about this method. Now I look for products that don't have oils too high in the ingredient list.\n\nHere are the top 3 for me:\n\n1. Giovanni L. A. Holding gel\n\nIt's a great combination of strong hold, shine and frizz-control (out of 10, I would give it 9 for hold, 10 for shine and 10 for frizz-control). I apply it on towel dried hair, then form waves and blow dry with a diffuser using the lowest heat setting and no heat interchangeably. Next day I brush my hair and if it got frizzy overnight I either run more gel through it, or use Umberto Giannini No-Fizz serum (it's quite lightweight, unlike oils that are definitely too heavy for my hair). Sometimes I start with using damp hands to redefine my waves before applying more product. Then I either let it air-dry or diffuse again. If I diffuse hair in the morning, I apply products to tame frizz after diffusing. \n\n2. Umberto Giannini Curl Jelly \n\nThe hold is great. It's 11/10. Frizz control was more like 7/10. Doesn't do much for shine. It's quite liquidy and easy to distribute through hair. Very easy to restyle hair the next day with wet hands too. I used to apply it to towel dried hair, or to 60% blow dried-hair. It worked either way. I would often go for a wet hair look for the first day with this gel and just let it air-dry. The next day I would brush it and the waves would still be in place and still going strong. Same for day 3 and even 4. After brushing, I would redefine my waves with wet/damp hands and that would be it. I had to add the No-Fizz serum to my routine with this gel though, because it wasn't as good at controlling it. It also dries crunchy, but after brushing all crunch was gone.\n\n3. Eco Style Argan Oil gel\n\nHold 6/10, Shine 10/10, Frizz control 11/10\n\nI've put it in the third place subjectively, based on the fact that strong hold is the most important factor for me. I had no frizz with this gel and my hair looked very nice and natural. It doesn't create a gel cast at all. \n\nOther products I liked are Marc Anthony Strictly Curls Curl Defining Lotion and Umberto Giannini Conditioning Water. Conditioning Water water was great and I could use it either as a container or as a shampoo, but it seems like it might have been discontinued. I can't find it in New Zealand anymore. So now I use a regular conditioner and just before getting out of the shower apply the Curl Lotion. Then squeeze my hair dry with a microfiber towel (a smooth one from a hiking shop, not a fluffy turban one).",

First of all, you definitely have some sort of textured hair, if brushing it makes it fluff out. I have A LOT of hair, super dense but fine strands and my hair is wavy. Brushing my hair makes it fluff out and poofy like a lion. You said you felt like the curly girl method made your hair limp and greasy, it means the products were probably too heavy for your hair type. I can’t do the curly girl method because it makes my hair limp and weighed down. So there’s a few different methods I’d recommend that I do, just depends on what I’m feeling. I do this all in the morning, first, I take a spray bottle and get my hair damp but closer to wet than dry. I rotate my head in a circle so then my hair is hanging down and I’m kinda upside down. Then I’ll scrunch one time with just the wet hair, no products. Then, I’ll add a mousse, I add a few puffs into my hands, gently rub together and then gently coat it through my hair then scrunch. You’re really gonna want to focus on the scrunch hand position and the praying hands position. Then I rotate my head to get me back upright. I let it air dry but a diffuser honestly really helps too and sometimes I feel like makes my waves look better. I’m just lazy and hate the diffusing and blow dry process lol. But if you let it air dry, I usually scrunch it a few more times as it dries. The other method I do is repeat the same steps with the water, but then I’ll take an itty bitty bit of a curl cream, like a dime sized amount and I’ll dilute it with water, then I’ll apply it to my hair in the same method as the mousse. You want to be careful because with a hair type like ours, there’s a fine line between poofy mess and limp greasy hair when it comes to using products. If your hair is still poofy, I’d recommend spraying more water on your hair before applying products, it’ll help the poofy die down but also make application easier. But if it’s limp and greasy, use less product. It’s totally trial and error, I still have days where I realize I need to add more water or I used a bit too much product. Another thing is, don’t wash your hair everyday. I wash my hair every few days, then I’ll brush it once after I shower and let it air dry, every night before bed I’ll tilt my head over and put it in an incredibly loose ponytail or bun on top of my head, like the pineapple method. I’m a crazy sleeper so my hair does end up getting a bit tangled in the morning, so I usually used a wide toothed comb to comb out the crazy parts and once I add water and wet down my hair, the poof isn’t there anymore.",

    "body": "Hey all! I’ve been wondering when to make a post again as of recently but I realized I am close to a very important milestone in my weight loss so I figured I’d confirm that I’m still at it!\n\nIt’s been about 3 years since I’ve started trying to eat healthier, and I’ve hit 158lbs down from 227-30lbs starting in 2021.\n\nMy most major changes in order from most to minor..\n\nWalking over 10,000 steps a day. I got an active job from being completely sedentary. (Sub 1,000 steps per day)\n\nI cut out most junk food, fast food and dairy. I figured out I have a dairy allergy and have swapped in favor of high protein, high fat and high fiber. I started paying attention to foods that make me feel sick, dizzy and tired and cut them out.\n\nI started managing my PCOS. I take Magnesium, Inositol, Spearmint, Probiotics, Vit D, Multivitamin, biotin/collagen and fish oil. Looking to get on metformin soon. I am still insulin resistant.\n\nIntermittent fasting 8:16 and 4:20 has helped me get my insulin levels in check enough to not always feel sick. \n\nMost importantly though is not quitting. PCOS is a hard disease to manage. It’s debilitating, demoralizing and sometimes just downright miserable. I just want to extend my hand to anyone who needs to see this- it is possible. Just keep working hard, I believe in you!! \n\nCheers to three pounds til my first major goal of 155 lbs! 🎉\n",

Just wanted to share some of my hubby’s progress pics and say thanks for all the guys who shared what’s worked for them.\n\nHe was very serious about getting some growth before the new year so I purchased everything I could to give him the best chance. I can’t take credit, though, because he’s the one keeping up with his daily routine. \n\nI’m not sure what exactly is working, or if it’s everything together. He started everything around the same time so it’s hard to say. \n\nJust sharing because it took me a while to create this routine based on many different sources. \n\nI wasn’t entirely convinced that this would work, but I am honestly shocked at how good his hair is coming in. I told him if he stuck to this routine for a year and it didn’t work we could book a consult for a transplant. The way things are going it looks like I can book a vacation instead!\n\nMORNING:\n-Topical OTC minoxidil spray w/The Ordinary multi-peptide serum for hair density\n-Oral fin, collagen, biotin and multivitamin \n-Injectable GHK-cu \n\nEVENING:\n-Vigorous scalp scrub to exfoliate in the shower \n-Topical minoxidil \n-Mielle rosemary & mint scalp and hair oil\n\nWEEKLY:\n-Microneedling .5 depth with Dr Pen 8 using TO multi-peptide serum for hair density\n\nMONTHLY:\n-Microneedling 1.5 depth with Dr Pen 8 using exosomes. This one is painful and I use lido numbing cream. Both exosomes and lido purchased from a Korean beauty website. ",

Spinach has all the Vitamin A,C,K,Calcium, Magnesium. And nutritional yeast has all the B vitamins, zinc. You are supposed to have the yeast with food. And it would give the spinach a nutty/cheese flavour to make it more interesting. They complement each other perfectly.\n\nYou still would be missing 60% of vitamin E, all your Vitamin D (hard to get from food - but sardines will work), 40% of your zinc and iron and B2, 33% your magnesium and Phosphorus, Potassium and Copper. Though you can use 2 teaspoons of yeast flakes to solve half of that. However you cant really get much more iron/calcium/zinc/magnesium from this meal anyway as your body can only absorb 700mg of those at once and you are reaching that limit with this meal.\n\nBut if you eat this you are pretty much covered since you have another 1900 calories left to get the 10% of things still left. This should fit into any diet. In fact despite being totally carbs this is even keto compliant - as leafy greens at or below 5% of total calories is allowed. It will work with ultra-low calorie diets like 500 calorie OMAD. It will work with putting on muscle while losing fat (when you need to eat 150g in 1500 calories, which is tough).\n\n\nBoth things store for a long time and take minimal preparation. It costs less than £1. Its also 40% of your fibre. Microwave it or sautee it in butter with garlic and lemon or cumin and garam masla. Then sprinkle yeast flakes at end.\n\nOne 460g can (2 cups) of spinach (£0.80):\n\n* 600% of Vitamin A\n* 100% Vitamin C\n* 2500% Vitamin K\n* 40% Vitamin E\n* 68% folate (B9)\n* 40% Calcium\n* 40% iron\n* 66% Magnesium\n\n5g Nutritional yeast (£10/450*5= £0.11):\n\n* 200% B1\n* 64% B2\n* 107% B3\n* 121% B6\n* 110% Folic Acid (B9)\n* 88% B12\n* 20% biotin B7\n* 117% B5 \n* 60% zinc\n\n\nSources for spinach:  \nhttps://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2629/2  \nhttps://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2927/2\n\nSources for nutritional yeast:  \n'Engevita Yeast With B12' - any brand will do though I'm sure.

    "body": "Long, lifted lashes are a huge halo, and open up your eyes a ton. Unfortunately, lash serums are controversial on here. Many people have experienced fat loss around the eyes due to Latisse and similar serums, but prostaglandin (and prostaglandin analogues) are the only ingredients that have been scientifically proven to increase lash length beyond genetic limitations.\n\n**What about castor oil?**\n\n* Castor oil just conditions the lashes and gives the appearance of thicker lashes.\n* Some people swear on their life that castor oil truly increased their lash length, but they previously damaged their natural lashes with mascara or extensions. Putting on castor oil therefore \\*\\*did\\*\\* grow their lashes, but not beyond their genetic limitations. As someone who doesn’t wear mascara, this is useless to me.\n* Though to be fair, castor oil does contain a ton of ricinoleic acid, which can be stimulating for growth. This probably explains the ample anecdotal evidence when it comes to hair growth on the scalp (if your bald spots are NOT caused by genetics). I don’t think it would work much for lashes though.\n\nAnyway, I went on a hunt for alternatives without side effects. There are a few ingredients that have been **scientifically shown to cause hair and lash growth** (in studies of varying quality), which I’ve listed below, linking to sources:\n\nRed Clover Extract and [Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acetyl-tetrapeptide-3) (makes up Capixyl)\n\n[Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/myristoyl-pentapeptide-17) and [Myristoyl Hexapeptide-16](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/myristoyl-hexapeptide-16)\n\n[Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1 combined with Biotin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/biotinoyl-tripeptide-1)\n\nRELEVANT PRODUCTS:\n\n[Angfa, Scalp-D Beaute, Pure Free Eyelash Premium Serum](https://www.iherb.com/pr/Angfa-Scalp-D-Beaute-Pure-Free-Eyelash-Premium-Serum-0-14-fl-oz-4-ml/93530) \\- Contains biotinoyl tripeptide-1, oligopeptide-20, acetyl decapeptide-3, octapeptide-2, oligopeptide-41, caprooyl tetrapeptide-3, acetyl tetrapeptide-5, acetyl hexapeptide-8 high up on the ingredients list. Not sure what any of these do lol, except for biotinoyl tripeptide-1, which is the first peptide on the list. Reviews are good, but results are not dramatic. Seems to do more conditioning than growing.\n\n[The Glow Makers Eyelash and Brow Growth Peptide Complex Serum](https://theglowmaker.com/collections/all-products/products/eyelash-and-brow-growth-peptide-complex-serum) \\- Contains Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17, Myristoyl Hexapeptide-16, Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3, Red Clover Extract, Biotin. That’s EVERYTHING with studies on lash growth, what an absolute jackpot. The site is kind of sketchy though and there are no reviews, has anyone tried this?\n\n[Indeed Labs Peptalash II Eyelash Serum](https://www.ulta.com/peptalash-ii-eyelash-serum?productId=pimprod2012661) \\- Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17, Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1, N-Prolyl Palmitoyl Tripeptide-56 Acetate (which I think is a component of Matrixyl). Interesting choice of peptides for sure… also contains Apple Stem Cells ([Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/malus-domestica-fruit-cell-culture))… don’t know if that does anything for lashes. Reviews are mediocre, but it does work somewhat.\n\n[RevivLashes](https://revivserums.com/products/lash-brow-stimulating-serum) \\- rh-Polypeptide-3 (Keratinocyte Growth Factor, apparently), Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3, Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17, Myristoyl Octapeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Tripeptide-3, Copper Tripeptide-1 (Oof, copper peptides are a controversial but it’s the last ingredient). Reviews for this seem really good and it contains most of the peptides helpful for lash growth, plus some others that might be helpful. Also contains Apple Stem Cells.\n\n[Luna Nectar Moon Boost](https://lunanectar.com/products/moon-boost) \\- Contains Red Clover Extract, Castor Oil, and Biotin, but none of the peptides. I doubt this would work, but the reviews seem good if they can be believed. It’s definitely the most natural and “safest” out of everything in the list, though.\n\nI plan to try RevivLashes or The Glow Maker, but am wary of both. Has anyone tried a prostaglandin-free serum that actually worked? And what do you do for your lashes?",

    "body": "The beard care industry is packed with misinformation and marketing nonsense, and I tend to get a little worked up about it. A lot of this confusion comes from people making up nonsense to cover for subpar product, or from amateurs who learn their craft from marketing materials, not peer-reviewed scientific journals. If a company wants to sell argan oil, for example, they are going to tell you that argan oil is the best thing ever. That is not science. It’s marketing. New amateur beard oil crafters learn from these materials and pass that info on to others as fact. Beard growers trust crafters, and before you know it, badabing badabip,  thousands of beard growers think subpar ingredients are the gold standard, superficial benefit is the best it gets, and that gimmicks are essential for the journey. Even worse, folks get used to underperforming products and come to believe that ALL beard care is gimmick and nonsense.\n\nIt’s time to debunk some bullsh\\*t and set the record straight.\n\n**“What works for your beard.”**\n\nYou’ve probably heard this one before: “Everybody’s beard is different.” It sounds good, but it’s often used to justify mediocre products. Beard hair is textured hair, and products that work well on textured hair will work universally on beards. Hair science shows that the right combination of fatty acids and triglycerides is universally beneficial, regardless of individual beard variations. Instead of using this phrase as an excuse for why something isn’t delivering, focus on scientifically-backed formulations designed to nourish and support healthy growth.\n\n**“Beard oil is just for the hair.”**\n\nThis is a big misconception. Beard oil is for both the hair and the skin. Bioavailable fatty acids in good beard oils penetrate the hair shaft, reaching the cortex where they soften, strengthen, and hydrate. At the same time, they nourish the skin underneath, reducing inflammation and preventing itch and flakes. If your beard oil isn’t doing this, it’s not good enough. Lipidology studies show that the fatty acid profile of oils determines their ability to penetrate and work effectively, which is why cheap oils fail to deliver long-term results.\n\n**“Beard growth vitamins are essential.”**\n\nMost beard growth vitamins are glorified multivitamins with fancy marketing. Unless you’re deficient in key nutrients like biotin or zinc, they won’t magically make your beard grow faster or thicker. Nutritional science indicates that the body has an absorption threshold for vitamins, and any excess is simply excreted in your urine. Instead of literally pissing away your money, just eat a balanced diet, drink water, and take care of your skin and hair with a good routine. If you’re deficient, address that deficiency. But don’t expect miracles from over-the-counter pills.\n\n**“Beard balms clog pores and cause acne.”**\n\nThis one depends on the ingredients. Cheap balms with comedogenic oils like coconut can clog pores, but well-formulated balms using non-comedogenic oils won’t. A good balm will condition both your skin and hair without causing irritation or buildup. Research into comedogenicity highlights that not all oils are created equal. Choose balms with oils like hemp seed or grapeseed that penetrate without clogging. If you’re breaking out, it’s likely due to poor hygiene or overuse, not the product itself.\n\n**“Grey hairs are dead and can’t be repaired.”**\n\nGrey hairs lose melanin, which does affect their structure, making them more brittle and wiry. However, they are far from dead. The loss of melanin leads to structural voids in the keratin bonds, but bioavailable fatty acids can penetrate, strengthen those bonds, and smooth the hair cuticle. This transforms wiry, unmanageable grey hairs into soft, smooth strands. Studies have shown that essential fatty acids can fill these structural gaps, restoring elasticity and manageability. A healthy grey beard is a thing of beauty. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\n**“Split ends mean your beard isn’t healthy.”**\n\nSplit ends are a normal part of having a beard, especially if it’s long. They occur when the cuticle gets damaged, exposing the inner layers of the hair. Regular trims, proper hydration, and using high-quality oils and balms can help minimize them, but they’re not a sign of an unhealthy beard. Damage can be mitigated with consistent care. Use fatty-acid-rich products to nourish and protect your hair’s outer layer to prevent splits from traveling up the shaft. It is ok to get a healthy trim from time to time to cut away split ends.\n\n**“If your beard itches, it just means it’s growing.”**\n\nNot true at all. Growth doesn't itch. Itching happens because your skin is inflamed or dehydrated. When hair grows, it pulls moisture from your skin, leaving it dry. Add in dirt, sweat, and poor grooming habits, and you’ve got itching. Hydrate the skin, reduce inflammation, and create a healthy environment for growth. Dehydrated skin triggers an inflammatory response, which amplifies the discomfort. Keep your skin happy!\n\n**“You need to derma roll or use minoxidil to grow a thicker beard.”**\n\nDerma rollers come with an insane infection risk, and minoxidil is only a temporary fix at best. Neither of these options actually makes your follicles healthier. Follicles are affected by genetic and hormonal factors, not mechanical damage or temporary vasodilation. The follicles you have are the follicles you’ve got. Genetics determine their density.\n\n**“Beards grow slower in the winter.”**\n\nBeards don’t grow slower in cold weather. The truth is, harsh winter conditions can make them feel drier, brittle, and harder to maintain. This gives the illusion that growth has slowed down. Scientific studies on hair growth cycles confirm that external temperature has little to no impact on follicular activity. Instead, focus on keeping your beard hydrated and protected to counteract environmental stressors that might make it seem like your growth has stalled.\n\nBeard care doesn’t have to be complicated, but it does require separating fact from fiction. Stick with high-quality products, focus on good grooming habits, and ignore the marketing noise. When we know better, we do better. As beard care crafters, we have an obligation to teach this so you can make the best decisions for your beard. Your beard deserves the best, and so do you, homie! ",

The last cyst was so big and painful, almost a centimeter and a half in size. My hair also went from being good with an every other day wash to a MUST wash. It was just so greasy. \n\nBecause this is a supplement that is supposed to improve skin I did not make the connection. I just assumed my body was finally reacting to getting off birth control pills six months ago. \n\nUpped my Retin A, skin looked worse. Tried showering twice a day, no effect. Salicylic acid, glycolic acid, niacinamide. Spearmint tea. Nothing was working. I made an appointment to see a derm and they didn't seem to make any meaningful connection between my first time in my life cystic acne and the new supplement. \n\nGuys. It was the freaking biotin in the supplement. I stopped the supplement exactly three weeks ago and have not gotten one pimple since. Hair is back to normal and I can wash it every other day. ",

I started breaking out in ways I don’t normally, like on my cheeks, forehead, etc.  I tried different forms of b12, methylated vs non methylated, liquid and pill. Without fail after 2-3 days of supplementation, I’d break out. Researched it and found b12 is factor in acne because apparently the bacteria that cause acne also feed on b12. I haven’t tried supplementing again but I need to because I’m still very deficient. I assume using an antibacterial is the only way to combat it. But I’m scared lol. I’ve been using 15% AA for a few weeks now which I know is antibacterial but I don’t know if it’d be enough. Tretinoin isn’t antibacterial but it wasn’t enough to stop those b12 breakouts. The only other option I read is consuming b12 through foods….like liver. I cannot. Lol. Strangely, I don’t breakout from b12 in energy drinks. I believe I read it was from the high doses in supplements (because most of it gets peed out so high doses are necessary to reach normal levels). Those hair and skin vitamins are loaded with b vitamins that can cause break outs.",

    "body": "Here is a list of protocol my partner and I have implemented to improve our CPTSD. We are isolated in an area that has a real stigma towards the disabled and LGBTQ+ community, there are no hate crime laws that protect them here, so this adds additional logistical hurdles and terror. There's more anti-LGBT stickers and propaganda popping up around town and this sends a chill down my spine. My partner transitions in secret for this reason.\n\nWith the pandemic and so many anti mask/anti vax people around, I am so scared of leaving my house most days. For the last 8 years I've feared for my partner's safety in this town, I feared for our future as people who struggle with CPTSD.\n\nWe don't have the in-person social supported needed for re-regulation and we can't receive this until we earn enough to move out of here and relocate in the city where resources and advocacy are better overall.\n\nIt is a catch 22, got to heal more to earn more, but got to earn more to heal more. With our struggles with CPTSD we are stuck here for the time being, however at the very least I can share here what has helped us improve as a team.\n\nMy partner researches the protocol, she's got a 4 year degree in psychology and compulsively looks up studies and resources to heal these and other issues. I implement what she researches, I'm pretty handy in some ways. Despite the hurdles, improvements have been made.\n\nThis is what we've done to improve our CPTSD together.\n\n* Trauma releasing exercises, these are demonstrated on youtube, I could do these even when I was 300lbs so they are feasible. You should give yourself some time to rest, 15-30 minutes at least, after doing them for regulation and integration.\n* Polyvagal theory exercises, Sukie Baxter on youtube does content on this. Irene Lion does as well and she has other trauma healing resources too that I use.\n* Breathwork, be careful with this one because this can be too activating, but it releases trauma from the body. There's a lot of breathing techniques on youtube. This combined with vinpocetine and canned oxygen for me boosted the effect somewhat.\n* Yoga, with my fatigue I struggle to implement this more regularly but yin yoga is recommended.\n* Accupressure desensitization, basically you rub, tap, or stimulate accupressure points, namely on the face and hands. This works better if you alternate between the left and right sides of your body.\n* Modafinil, this helps push through the fatigue but the generics are less effective on me, this is one of the psychmeds that have manageable side effects for me and the pros outweigh the cons. However I can't sustain taking it everyday due to the side effects on me personally, max I can do is 200mg a week for 6 weeks currently. I add choline and tyrosine to improve the effects. Ashwaganda and rhodiola rosea added to this stack adds a calming effect without sedation for me personally. Modafinil and Armodafinil burns through choline and adding this is ideal so there isn't a deficiency. There's other nootropic stacks and there's subreddits that discuss stacks for different effects but Modafinil is the 80/20 plus choline.\n* Internal Family Systems Therapy, there is a subreddit for this. This is a promising therapy modality for CPTSD and it has helped me process many things on my own with just self guided resources. It would be more ideal to have a specialist who can do this, it is similar to Voice Dialog. My partner's therapist does this with her. I've been unable to find a therapist in this for myself.\n* Somatic experiencing, this is made by Peter Levine and his resources have been helpful as well. This allows the body to complete the trauma response, allowing it to release it gently.\n* Feldenkrais, Irene Lion also goes into this, this can help process trauma from the womb or trauma that isn't remembered.\n* Acceptance and Commitment therapy, self guided.\n* Ego death meditation, I wouldn't recommend this for someone's first rodeo with mediation but this helps me rinse away unnecessary pain, helps with making clean pain instead of dirty pain, Therapy in a Nutshell on youtube discusses this concept in a few of those clips.\n* Nonduality spiritual tapes, this again is more advanced for CPTSD rehab and been listening to ebooks on this, this teaches how to be in the present moment, and to settle into the awareness that is behind the ego. This can give some relief, or at least some perspective but not a good route to go if someone is in the early stages of CPTSD rehab.\n* Cathartic meditation method, this is a technique my partner came up with by combining elements of breathwork, somatic experiencing, and dance. She wrote an ebook on it before she started transitioning.\n* Urge surfing, this is more in relation to addiction management.\n* Dabbled a bit in some qi gong, the five animal frolics act like somatic experiencing.\n* Semax, a Russian nootropic that helped me regain some cognitive functioning, but this was too activating for me on its own so I combine it with Selank, a calming nootropic from the same company. They can be combined without issue. This worked for me but I'm not sure how this would work for other people with CPTSD.\n* Chasteberry for mood swings related PMS/PMDD, this has been the only thing that helped with this for me and it shaves off the friction around that time a month by 30-50%. Ginko biloba is also recommend for this but I've not had as good of results with it for this issue, but it doesn't hurt.\n* tDCS for my drug resistant depression. Had to do a lot of homework and tinkering for this one, but got all the stuff for it for under $200 and this was the only thing that improved my depression with little to no side effects. I would prefer a specialist that does transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) but this is very expensive out of pocket. Both tDCS and TMS need at least a month of daily use in the right locations for it to work. Worst case scenario it doesn't work and no side effects.\n* Ice baths and cold showers, this can help the nervous system re-regulate but don't go too much too fast. Even a short rinse in cold water, a couple of seconds, can help. If you want to go full Wim Hof there's subreddits for that and breathwork will be needed.\n* Medical cannabis combined with CBD assisted self therapy, in these sessions I load up music that evokes a trauma, or music that evokes a time period or unprocessed sentiment, and I let that surface. The weed softens, not numbs, the experience enough for me to process it, to give it the space it needs, and I've healed a particularly deep trauma from this method. CBG also works out pretty well, mango increases the weed effects and fresh mango works a bit better than dried mango but both work.\n* Weight training, building muscle helps with regulation as well as processing and empowerment, I've used low doses of ligandrol and mk 677 to help build a bit extra muscle for a 6 week cycle, the mk 677 helped with sleep when I struggled during the winter over a specific trauma that is now processed. I wouldn't recommend SARMs for other people in general, especially if they have liver issues. I only added them just to get a bit extra muscle for nervous system regulation and resilience.\n* Empathy/compassion exercises generally in combination with Medical cannabis and CBD, 1:1 seems best for me personally. With this I visit traumatic moments and I start to dissect the psychology of the abusers in these situations, I do some detective work in my head and piece together how they ended up like that, I trace the trauma thread. This is an advanced technique, I was not able to do this in the beginning years of my recovery. Also this isn't a good tech for everyone, but it helped me see these destructive and hurtful people as broken, because they are. I went from feeling like a victim of malicious intent and design to feeling compassion for what was done to these people to make them into this. Instead of realizing their highest good in life, they were rendered into a broken shadow of that instead with little hope to be much else. This is hell in itself. This doesn't justify the damage they caused, not at all, but it reframes it in a way that allows me personally to process it better and to grow into the kind of person I actually want to be in this life. This all falls into radical acceptance. To be clear, acceptance does not mean agreeing with it, it just means acknowledging and facing reality on reality's terms.\n* Gardening, this in general is just therapeutic if I can keep up with it.\n* Decarboxylated amanita muscaria, Muscimol is promising for benzo recovery in particular as well as other issues, but decarbing this mushroom with DIY protocols is not something I recommend. There was a canadian pharma company that was refining this, forgot the name or if it was able to launch.\n* The Ashton Mehod for benzo recovery, my partner was left on 1mg of Ativan for 5 years and this caused her so many additional problems, this was the only medical intervention she received before I arrived here. This protocol took a year to implement and I've written about this process in an older post if this if anyone's interested. This isn't directly related to CPTSD rehab, more like a pre-requiste we had to solve beforehand, but it is absolutely needed because of how common benzos are still prescribed and it is too easy for anyone to end up on these meds for way too long. Biotin is also a need for this recovery, my partner still can't function if her biotin levels are too low.\n* The Sedona method is really overhyped but there's two principles in it that were helpful, the \"could I let it go? Will I? When?\" questioning method helps with letting go of rumination among other things. The other helpful tidbit they teach is about framing all your inner problems as desires for control, approval, and security. Behind these two principles though it starts to get a bit watered down and fluffy.\n* Richard Bandler's hypnosis recordings have helped me with progressive relaxation in the past. There's other ways to do progressive relaxation though and there's youtubes on how to do those exercises.\n* Lions mane and psilocybin microdosing/macrodosing combined with self guided therapy or my partner provides a hypnosis session or guided meditation audio resources, this was also very helpful. For me tDCS increased the effect of the micro and macrodosing, I saw that raw cocoa nibs is supposed to increase the effects of magic mushrooms but I didn't see this effect personally.\n* Body scanning and mindfulness techniques.\n* Inner smile meditation\n* Resourcing/grounding techniques, Irene Lyon talks about this and other trauma courses do as well. Basically you orient yourself towards safety, one exercise is just to slowly pan your head around the room and gently taking notice of your sensory experience. This trains your nervous system to calm down.\n* Epsom salt baths help supplement magnesium and ease body traumas in general, I combine this with massage. While in the hot bath I spray cold water on my scalp and along the base of the neck, I wouldn't recommend this to others, specifically combining a hot bath with a cold shower to the head, but it works on me with calming down and releasing more.\n* Knitting/crocheting is meditative when I am not fatigued.\n* The Work has really helped with racing thoughts and rumination, the worksheet and process is simple and here's the link: [https://thework.com/instruction-the-work-byron-katie/](https://thework.com/instruction-the-work-byron-katie/)\n* The Wholeness work has also been really helpful with reframing stressful people and situations.\n* We made self help courses on other techniques that helped us on Udemy, Skillshare isn't a fan of self help content so we got booted.\n* Inflammation management is critical, eat foods that reduce inflammation. Many spices are very good for this, combine them with oils and eat it up.\n* Gut flora, get in those good gut bacteria, you can homemake yogurt in the oven, or with multicookers that have yogurt functions, and this ensures that you are eating live probiotics. Yogurt, even Activa from the store, generally has dead or low cultures by the time you buy it. Combine this with prebiotics like garlic and barley grass and this will help overall functioning.\n* EMDR apps help, I've got two of them on hand, BLST on my phone for audio EMDR and \"Go With That 4.0 Free\" on my desktop for visual EMDR.\n* Journalling on reddit.\n* Meditative asemic writing.\n* Stream of Conscious art therapy, self guided.\n* Various CPTSD home courses, audiobooks, ebooks from Pete Walker and others.\n\nHere are some treatment options I want to look into when I am able:\n\n* TMS, transcranial magnetic stimulation.\n* Vagus nerve pacemaker, I knew a woman with it and it really helped her, lasts 10 years and FDA approved I heard.\n* Hyperbaric oxygen chamber combined with breathwork.\n* Ketamine assisted therapy but I'm not as eager about this one. I'd still give it a go though.\n* MDMA assisted therapy, this is very promising for CPTSD.\n* sensory deprivation tank.\n* acupuncture.\n* cryotherapy\n* Pharma grade Muscimol\n* cerebrolysin for chronic fatigue\n\nA side note, I wouldn't recommend dabbling in Kundalini stuff for CPTSD, I had a random kundalini experience on accident when I was doing trauma releasing and it is an additional challenge on a nervous system level. This will sound crazy but kundalini psychosis is a real thing and it can happen with people who have CPTSD or other mental health issues. Just avoid Kundalini stuff for self help with CPTSD in general, that's for people with very regulated nervous systems.\n\nHopefully this was helpful, we aim to make projects and animation that teaches about CPTSD, mental illness, and multigenerational pathology. My partner is working on her first short film about growing up with an alcoholic father as a disabled youth.\n\nWe aim to do good work in this life to help less people not end up broken for years like us.\n\nIf I remember more I will add it here.\n\n\\---------\n\nEdit August 23rd, with every treatment option, regardless of the source, extensive homework and research is needed. What I've written here is no exception. \n\nWhat I have listed has helped me improve, these are just our results. I did not write this to promise everything here is a cure, I did not write this to mislead anyone out of ignorance or arrogance. I wrote this to show the hope that keeps me alive, what keeps us inspired despite the odds and hurdles. This is what we've done to realize this hope. \n\nEight years ago when I first arrived here to help my partner, I was approximately 5% of my original functioning before my breakdown. With everything we've done over the years, with what I've listed here, I am now at roughly 40% of that original functioning. My partner has improved as a result of these efforts as well since then. It is hard still but it was far, far worse before these efforts and before this progress. \n\nI was too unwell to even use reddit until roughly two years ago, even writing like this now is part of that progress. This has been a crude process, the best way we could help ourselves with this, I aim to be fully transparent about this.  \n\nI want this to be critiqued, I want everything on this list to be critiqued, refined so that only the best options for others remain. If an option is truly unviable then it must be debunked and cast aside. I want this to be heavily critiqued and questioned, I aim to provide more gold and less risks, less pitfalls, less hazards. Thank you to everyone that ripped into this, there is a lot of comments here and I need to rest more in order to give each of these comments the time and attention they deserve. \n\nKind redditors have let me know of the risks with TMS, this was something I was optimistic about but from what I've seen from yesterday's interactions it is no longer a treatment I am hopeful for. There are risks, more risks than I originally found, weigh the risks, weigh the pros and cons. \n\nWith muscimol, until there is a highly refined, high quality lab produced product from a reputable company, this is not an option either. I listed this because this was one option we've explored and there were some improvements with anxiety with us with minimal, very minimal, use. But until there is a refined and safe product, until there is more research and trial and error, it should be avoided, I do not recommend DIY methods for anyone. \n\nIt is not my intention to spread harm and misinformation, it is my aim and goal to receive critique with humility and gratitude and to incorporate those lessons in this work to improve what we can do. \n\nI need more time to rest, chronic fatigue is heavy right now, but I will respond to each of you and I will receive what you offer with gratitude and careful consideration. I am grateful for this engagement, for this discussion and refinement process. I aim to weed out unviable options and to only leave the viable ones, but this is a work in progress and healing from this requires an interdisciplinary approach. \n\nThank you everyone for helping us be better at this work.

        "body": "There was a comment here I was replying to and it was deleted, I will post the reply here: \n\n*\"In my 11-year journey, I've come to believe very strongly in 2 things: that CPTSD requires this kind of holistic, multi-pronged approach that is far beyond what most mental health professionals are aware of or support - and that a huge amount of healing is possible without a therapist.\"* \n\n  \nYou've really hit the nail here, and because they cannot provide this, which isn't their fault and I do not blame them for this, it actually has set me up for more trauma than rehabilitation. \n\n  \nI've been forced to go through hoops for disability payments here and psychiatry is the gatekeeper for this. Therapists can't sign off on disability payments. My plan was try to try to negotiate a way to access the treatments that actually help me. \n\n  \nFor this task I visited 3 psychiatrists. The first one was one I worked with 5 years ago. I was bedridden for 6 weeks on Topomax that she perscribed and she just laughed and said I had drug resistant depression, she was the first psychiatrist I trusted with my issues in this country, I am originally from the US, since I had trauma from American psychiatry. She unknowingly violated that trust so I stopped my sessions with her back then and detoxed from her meds. Lost a lot of money on that, but she did prescribe me medical cannabis and Modafinil and was good with paperwork. \n\n  \nSince she was the only one that had paperwork on my case, I was forced to revisit her. During our second appointment I was struggling with a flashback due to additional stress around the pandemic. She refused to do online sessions and this only added stress. During that flashback she decided to talk about how vaccines are a hoax and basically it is all hyped up as a conspiracy. She also talked about how vaccines make people more ill, I had 3 vaccines with no side effects, I even communicated this in email before our sessions, but I was 6 weeks ill from her meds and she will never own this. I sent her a calm and professional email about this but she ghosted me. \n\n  \nThe other two psychiatrists were not much better, they both pushed an antipsychotic medication despite me communicating my trauma around psychiatry specifically with antipsychotic medication, they didn't take this trauma seriously. This trauma makes me terrified of being evaluated by psychiatrists, and this terror magnified my symptoms by 300%, they didn't understand this either despite me communicating this. One of those psychiatrists was an advocate for psychedelic treatment but refused to write me a medical cannabis script because he didn't see enough evidence for its effectiveness. \n\n  \nI've had to give up jumping through hoops with this because the disability payments were too low for me to sustain myself in this process and the treatments they pushed only put me more at risk, not to mention it would be an added expense on a high stakes gamble for me personally. The anti depressant they pushed seemed ok, I would have tried this if I wasn't worried about how it would work after I've already done microdosing and other treatments that work better for me. But when they kept pushing the antipsychotic med, that forced me to lose trust with psychiatry all over again. I understand that they were trying to help to the best of their ability, I don't blame the specialists for this, but they nor their colleagues, have no training in CPTSD, they don't even know the difference between PTSD and CPTSD. This is a huge problem with mental health services on the whole, lack of training regarding CPTSD.   \n\n  \nI am American but my partner is Polish and I fled here to Poland to help us recover and build projects together. Polish culture in general is more accepting of herbal treatment than the US, and mental health resources on average have been better here than what I had stateside.   \nMy partner came from a neglectful and abusive home, she was forced to heal herself because there was no intervention, just ridicule and neglect. She taught herself English and some German just from cartoons, she teaches herself so much. She got really good at research to save her life, and this inspired me, this reanimated me and I wanted to help provide her with a home so her skills, talents, and kindness can germinate. I've done the best I could do here with my limitations, she needs more than just me. \n\n  \nI have a link that shows the walk cycle of one of the characters, the alcoholic father, in the short film, if this link is a problem in this subreddit I can remove it: \n\n  \n[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/497036130412265482/1004696938538598410/animu\\_test-0002\\_1.gif](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/497036130412265482/1004696938538598410/animu_test-0002_1.gif)\n\n  \nThank you for your kind words, I am sorry it took me a while to respond to your comment kind internet stranger.",

When I was diagnosed with CPTSD I was so dysregulated I couldn’t take modafinil for a long time- my chest would hurt and I would feel too anxious. I was put on lithium and then latuda (both specifically for my CPTSD diagnosis), which did help with the acute symptoms I was experiencing but ultimately weren’t a good long term choice. I felt extremely low getting off the Latuda, especially combined with some life circumstances. I did some mushroom doses (micro and small regular doses) which was a great reset and am feeling good back on the modafinil. What you say about the choline is interesting as well.\n\nMany thanks to you and your partner. Wishing you a good future somewhere friendly.",

    "body": "TLDR: Hair loss recovery is highly YMMV, but possible. Here is my recovery before and after HRT which I started 5/2023, and some tips based on my experience.\n \nHair loss is my greatest source of dysphoria, and it almost kept me from pursuing transition. I remember the hope I experienced after seeing other MTF woman with hair recovery, even if examples were few and far between and it felt woefully improbable that I would experience anything similar. Really good recovery from HRT alone is rare, and seems to favor the very young, and I started in my late 30s with a long history of hair loss. My hope is that someone can benefit from my research and experience, but this is the ultimate YMMV. Genetic factors, age, duration and degree of hair loss, scalp thinning, factors completely out of anyone’s control will likely influence your results far more than mild differences in your treatment regimen. I’m merely sharing my own story. Full disclaimer, I am not an expert, and you should consult with your own doctor before trying anything I mention here- wink. Also, my hair is far from perfect… I had straight, fine, and relatively modest density hair when I was young. By the time I started my HRT about 1.5 years ago, I was still very thin up top but my scalp was mostly covered when dry and combed forward. Even with all my recovery to date, my hair is still thin, with a high hairline and recession, with a covered but thin crown. It would be challenging to have an attractive long hairstyle, but with it short I no longer appear bald or balding! As a NB MTF, I’m starting to accept it and growing more comfortable with it. I may still get a hair transplant in the future, but I’m in a much better starting place now than I was.\n\nI started noticing a receding hairline in my twenties. By 29, I was getting to a Norwood 4 with thinning at the crown. I started 1 mg oral finasteride and had some improvement, and my hair mostly stabilized until I started having more noticeable progression around 5 years ago in my later 30s. In 2021, my hair loss was significant, and I added treatments that had at least some clinical evidence of benefit in studies. The downside is that there are not many studies that look at combinations of therapies, since researchers are usually funded and interested in looking for the benefit of a single treatment. Although tempting, if you go scorched earth with 20 treatments all at once, you’ll never know if any one therapy is beneficial. Some may even be harmful. As there’s really is no magic treatment for hair loss for most people, I focused on maximizing my regimen with different therapy modalities if they worked for me, adding them in a stepwise fashion. I won’t go into a detailed timeline, but I will list what I currently use and my notes for each. I would guess that I got 60% of recovery pre-HRT, and 40% post-HRT.\n \nFinasteride 1 mg oral tablet: This is a DHT blocker. Highly recommend to anyone pre-HRT, and consider it even on HRT. There is also Dutasteride, which is more potent. I won’t go into a lot of detail about this here, but a DHT blocker is essential to prevent miniaturization and thinning of hair follicles. I suspect it may have helped me save some follicles from complete loss over the decade I was on it before HRT. One could argue it’s unnecessary while on HRT if your T is well controlled, but I’m still on it after 1.5 yrs of HRT.\n \nMinoxidil: I started the 5% topical foam in late 2021, consistently in early 2022, then added oral minoxidil at 1.25 mg twice daily (prescribed, please don’t drink topical minoxidil – yes people do this). It was initially developed as a hypertension blood pressure medication, and was found to have a side effect of hypertrichosis, increased hair growth, which led to the development of the topical formulation Rogaine. It’s effect is routinely attributed to increased blood flow, but evidence suggests it affects follicular cells including increasing the anagen growth phase of hair growth, increasing vascular endothelial growth factor, stimulating prostaglandin production, etc. I noticed my hair shafts thickened and darkened, to the point some people thought I was dying my hair darker, and density improved on topical alone. I definitely noted a benefit to oral minoxidil beyond topical alone. There is a risk for increasing body and beard hair with the oral formulation (FTMs know all about this I’m sure – haha). I already had body laser therapy in the past (a huge source of dysphoria as well), and was well into finishing my facial laser, so I didn’t notice this. My eyelashes are amazing and my brows improved though.  It definitely can have a lot of side effects. I noticed facial edema (swelling) and dry skin if I tried to increase my dose beyond 1.25 mg. The topical foam works for me, but I get a dermatitis reaction to the liquid formula (I happen to like using the foam, letting it dry my hair in a spikey way, and then I use my LLLT cap after). Minoxidil may also affect collagen production. This is not to mention that it is again a blood pressure medication, and although fairly safe at low doses, it can have significant potential adverse cardiovascular effects. I get mine as a prescription from my doctor, and I’d recommend anyone pursuing oral therapy to do the same.  Just do your research.\n \nMicroneedling: It is suspected that microneedling can cause micro injury, thereby stimulating healing, increasing local growth factors, and stimulating stem cell activation in the follicle, increasing overall thickness of hairs, causing more villus/fine hairs to potentially become more terminal hairs.  Additionally, it is likely it helps the effectiveness of topical minoxidil. One of the issues with it is the lack of a clear effective regimen. No one knows what the ideal depth or frequency of use is. This is a complicated topic, and unlike medications or topicals which can be used consistently between people, needling is a procedure and there are a wide variety of devices, depths, frequency of use, etc. Going too deep, too often, with a poor quality dull needle, are all dangerous and can lead to scarring and other complications. I would caution that there is a big difference between a true dermapen and a manual stamp or god forbid a cheap roller or repurposed permanent makeup device. I bought a derminator 2 from Vaughter Wellness, and it has been fantastic. I have the same machine I first bought and it works just like it’s brand new. When you factor in the savings over time, it’s a good option compared to disposables and much higher quality. They do sell some manual devices too. I always use a new needle cartridge, I like the 9 needle ones. I prep with 70% isopropyl alcohol and then follow up after the session with an application of their hyaluronic acid they sell.  In my research and experience, 1.5 mm for my scalp was the sweet spot for me, causing mild to moderate redness with occasional pinpoint bleeding, though I usually don’t have much at all. The scalp thins with androgenic alopecia, so the same depth isn’t right for everyone. I was using it every 3 weeks, but got behind for a while and went 4-5 weeks between treatments for 3 months or so and noticed worsening thinning in those areas. I decided to try every 2 weeks recently for several months and really saw improvement. I found this particular video by Dr. Gary Linkov out of New Yourk, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thQ1taoKoo4, to be helpful to understand it better. Be careful with this one. It has a lot of potential, but it can also go wrong.\n \nLow Level Laser Therapy (LLLT): I added LLLT with a mid range Capillus system in July of 2022. The one I use has 202 laser diodes (vs 112 or 272 at the time). It is believed to act on mitochondria, stimulating cytochrome c oxidase, increasing ATP synthesis which is the main energy source in cells. I use it 6 mins per day after my minoxidil application has dried. Although it’s the most expensive up front cost of any of my treatments, I’m still using the same one over 2 years later and have had no issues. I noticed most of the effect by about a year in. If you sign up for a newsletter, they send sales offers often, 30-40% off sales are not infrequent.\n \nHonorable Mentions:\nNizoral Ketoconazole 1% Shampoo: I started this in 2023. Mostly, I am prone to a drier scalp and dandruff, and this helps to mitigate that for me. It is believed to help clear away skin (dandruff aspect) and possibly some DHT blocking effect. The evidence is sparse at best. I use it several times a week.\n \nHair, skin, and nails biotin supplement: I do notice my hair and nails seemed to grow a bit faster when taking this. It’s a supplement, probably not harmful. Contains Biotin, Vit A, Vit C, Vit D, Vit E, Thiamin - B1, Riboflavin - B2, Pyridoxine HCl - B6, Cyanocobalamin - B12, and Folate.\n \nI found the topical minoxidil and the Biotin supplement are cheapest and best quality through Costco. I think they occasionally sell a capillus there too, but I bet their sales, including refurbished ones, might be cheaper. These therapies can cause shedding, especially common with the minoxidil though I noted it after my LLLT too. This isn’t necessarily bad, in fact it can be a sign that things are working. Lots of information on this in other forums.\n \nI hope this helped someone out there!!",

It’s not as thick as I would like and each hair is a lot finer than others in other places on my head, but I have hope it will get thicker in time. The only problem is that it grows so slowly.

I personally think if someone is transitioning and has hair loss they should consider finasteride instead of relying on T suppression alone.  While it does help, serum DHT =/= Scalp DHT and that's the dark nature of DHT.  It's in higher concentrations in certain areas of the body, and unfortunately, the scalp is one of the highest. This is most likely why Dutasteride, which kills over 99% of serum DHT, doesn't magically cure hairloss.  I've seen people who had years into their transition start finasteride and miraculously regain some lost ground which could suggest that the small amounts remaining have a significant impact, that's anecdotal though.",

    "body": "Hi. I’ve been browsing for a year now, first time posting on this, please mind the messy formats. \nI have severe OCD amongst other disappointing illnesses. for a while my impulse was picking skin, now I guess it’s hair. I’ve had extremely long and pretty healthy hair for my whole life. I had a breakdown a while back that made me do impulsive shit with my hair to cope with my crumbling self-esteem and dysmorphia. Yes, I know bleach is horrible for your hair. I was young and dumb and lived in whatever feeling I got when I would “reinvent” myself while doing this. I would get in trouble for picking my skin, so thought this was the next best thing to fidget on. \nBasically, reality has set in and I really fucked up. I can’t wear my hair down at all. I don’t feel like an ethereal princess anymore. The days I felt so insecure, there was no reason to be. I always wear my hair up in a silk scrunchie or claw clip. I can barely braid one side from the breakage. \nI know this doesn’t happen overnight, but any guidance to regain my confidence and long locks back will have me blissful. I hardly ever wanna look at my reflection, it just pisses me off that I let myself go to this level. How long do you think it would take for my hair to fully grow back? The blonde is fairly healthy, but the underneath and bleached side gets very fragile. I’ve chopped it to the same length before, but that side doesn’t retain the length. I have my hair up constantly so I haven’t bothered anything besides s+d.\n\nMy routine: scalp massages 3-4min every day, rosemary oil before every wash (2-3 days) I use redken extreme lengths. Hair mask or redken bonding concentrate, rinse conditioner w cool water, dry with microfiber towel or cotton shirt. Leave in conditioner, olaplex bonding oil (use on damp and everyday dry on ends). Sometimes I will use redken extreme bleach repair cream. Air dry. I sleep in a loose bun and use a silk pillowcase. Wet brush or bristle on dry hair, comb starting from ends. Search and destroy whenever I see it. Biotin and collagen supplements daily. I eat a vegan diet since 2020.",

I absolutely destroyed my hair about a year ago with bleach. A ton of it broke off & it looked so horrible. I cut it to about shoulder length & dyed it darker.

Actually came out great.  Second round I decided to do the roots myself cos I was a broke student.  I had no idea what I was doing, or that you’re not supposed to go over the bleach line.  Got in the shower to wash it out and some of it started snapping out in clumps - about an inch and a half from the root. Continued to be very thin, snapping easily, etc.  \n\nEventually, I dyed it back brown, lopped off as much as I could (to about chin length), kept getting regular cuts, and began using overnight scalp & hair treatments.  I kept up the maintenance after I was able to grow it all out to my natural hair. It is the healthiest it’s ever been: growing really fast, soft, and shiny.\n\nSo, even though this is really hard right now & I can imagine is affecting self-esteem amongst other things, you don’t need to worry so much about permanent damage. I always had super long hair too!! It’s growing back fabulously. \n\nI’d suggest finding a well-rated protein treatment, possibly a scalp detox serum (they’re like exfoliants I think), and some kind of leave-in cream/conditioner.  Oiling your hair is also really good for growth - so you could look into that. \n\nI really hope you’re okay & that this gets better for you soon.

        "body": "Clicking through this made my heart hurt. I went through a crazy few years and really took it out on my hair going from black to bleach blonde.  I lost probably 15 inches of beautiful, healthy, natural hair. I ended up doing a big chop and embraced wigs for about a year. Then I added in extensions until I felt more confident in my length. I'm nearly bra length again and I am finally started to feel like myself again. It's so hard when we correlate our level of beauty and attractiveness to our hair. The wonderful thing is that it grows back. I missed long hair so much, but I'm obsessed with my pictures from my bob era. It was the cutest. I know I won't have the courage to chop it again anytime soon, but you can look at the regrowth era as a chance to try new things. Wigs and extensions were annoying and expensive but were fun. I got to try cool colors that I wouldn't normally do. Looking back...I may chop an old wig into that bob again for days that I miss it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur hair can be a journey. You are stunning regardless of how it looks, just pour some love into the length you've got and relax while you regrow. Also, I swear by Olaplex's shampoo and conditioner. I shampoo and condition maybe twice per week (depends on how much I sweat). ALWAYS use heat protector if I'm straightening, tho I avoid heat where I can. Curlers when your hair is wet is the easiest way to style a bit without heat or over manipulation. Deep condition on the weekends. And looovee easy hairstyles like slick buns and French braids to give my hair breaks.  I also try-but rarely remember- to add oil to my scalp a few hours before washing. I get dry so it gives my scalp a drink. When I consistently moisturize my scalp my hair grows noticably faster. It took me about two years to get my hair from ear length to mid back.",

    "body": "About five months ago, I started taking a highly-rated multivitamin. Great formulation, nothing crazy, at least that’s what I thought. Everything seemed “just right”: no megadoses, no weird additives, just all the essentials. Perfect on paper.\n\nFast-forward to winter: my neurodermatitis (which usually flares a bit in cold months) went into overdrive. My hands were constantly inflamed, rough with hyperkeratosis, and I had to start using Protopic regularly just to function. But the inflammation *wouldn’t* go away this time. Something felt… off.\n\nThen three days ago (after 5 months taking the multi), I stopped the multivitamin cold turkey.\n\nAnd that’s when things changed fast.\n\nWithin a day, I felt *less inflamed* overall. Like my body wasn’t “buzzing” anymore. I exercise daily, eat well, and sleep decently, so this contrast hit me hard. I felt more grounded. *Calmer*, even.\n\nMy hands now look better than they had in months and I wasn't even using Protopic anymore.\n\nLooking back at the label, some things started to make sense. Vitamin B levels were through the roof, and vitamin A was also higher than I’d like for a daily dose. Keep in mind, this wasn’t even a “high dose” supplement like AG1 or “Your Hights,” which go even harder on certain vitamins.\n\nThat's what I took:\n\n|Nutrient|Amount|% NRV\\*|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Vitamin A**|467 µg RE|58%|\n|**Vitamin C**|200 mg|250%|\n|**Vitamin E**|12 mg α-TE|100%|\n|**Vitamin D3**|20 µg|400%|\n|**Vitamin K**|75 µg|100%|\n|**Vitamin B1 (Thiamin)**|2.8 mg|255%|\n|**Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)**|3.6 mg|257%|\n|**Niacin (B3)**|29 mg NE|181%|\n|**Pantothenic Acid (B5)**|18 mg|300%|\n|**Vitamin B6**|3.5 mg|250%|\n|**Biotin (B7)**|145 µg|290%|\n|**Folic Acid (B9)**|400 µg|200%|\n|**Vitamin B12**|20 µg|800%|\n|**Choline**|10 mg|\\-|\n|**Inositol**|10 mg|\\-|\n|**Zinc**|6.5 mg|65%|\n|**Selenium**|30 µg|55%|\n|**Copper**|0.7 mg|70%|\n|**Manganese**|1 mg|50%|\n|**Molybdenum**|35 µg|70%|\n|**Chromium**|40 µg|100%|\n|**Iodine**|100 µg|67%|\n|**Magnesium**|150 mg|40%|\n|**Coenzyme Q10**|10 mg|\\-|\n|**OPC (Oligomeric Proanthocyanidins)**|30 mg|\\-|\n\nI’m a healthy young adult. No chronic conditions, nothing to “treat.” And yet, following the *recommended* dose made me slightly sick over time.\n\nSo here’s my advice:  \n**Please be careful with multis and other daily supplements.** Just because they’re marketed as “safe for everyone” doesn’t mean your body agrees. Sometimes more is *not* better. Eat healthy, maybe take some electrolytes, and you are on the right track.\n\nAm I the only one with these issues?",

You didn't provide the key information, though, so there is no way I can know this from the first post.\n\nTaking unmethylated B6, B9, and B12 puts a burden on the B2 required to methylate those vitamins. The fact that you didn't specify which molecules means you have no understanding about this at all. So you might want to look up some widely available information on mthfr and unmethylated vitamins. \n\nIn a nutshell, natural vitamins work in your body, and artificial ones are often molecules your body has to yet make into the active or functional vitamin. But people often, yes often, come born without that ability. They apparently just have to know this stuff. If they don't and take the artificial vitamin, the artificial vitamin will act like a vitamin blocker and create a deficiency of that vitamin. For instance, folic acid will block the B9 from spinach. And other stuff. Meanwhile, folic acid is put into all flour products by law. So everyone needs to know a bit about this, but virtually no one does.",

I lurked this and the HT subreddit for months before pulling the trigger at all.\n\nI was bald for years and refused to go outside of my house without a hat. A hair transplant seemed like it would be too expensive as a majority of clinics said it would be upwards of $30,000 and multiple sessions. I ended up finding Flintridge FUE in the Los Angeles area and was quoted for 3,000 grafts at $3 a pop. I decided to give it a try.\n\nI did not start any meds before my HT (stupid, I know. And if I could have done it again I would have done 6-12 months before doing a HT). But as far as the procedure, the clinic was incredible and professional. I was scared as hell the morning of and when I went in, all those fears went away.\n\nPosting on here to give back to the subreddits that helped me come this far. I still have a ways to go, and went with a conservative hairline. I still have lots of hair growing and am micro needling my temples to hopefully have some more growth.",

    "body": "Respectfully, I see so much bad advice being given to people and I thought sharing my journey could be helpful! \n\nOkay so for background I couldn’t grow anything beyond a small goatee for most of my 20s. I didn’t really like the look so I was fresh faced for the majority of my life. I finally decided to try to grow a beard and IT TOOK TIME! \n\nThe first thing I did was research a 1st time growth routine. Mine was something like this: vitamin b12 or biotin (similar if I recall correctly) in the morning, derma-rolling and black seed oil after a shower. I did this daily for close to 8ish months before my beard really started to come in.\n\nNow of course genetics plays a huge roll, but most of my family also can’t grow a full beard so I’d like to think my efforts paid off. I see people posting progress after two weeks and people say shave it bc it’ll never come in… DO NOT LISTEN! For many, a first time beard takes effort and patience. Find a solid 1st time routine and stick to it. It doesn’t guarantee you’ll grow one, but it’ll definitely increase your chances.. and be willing to go through some “ugly” stages. Whatever you do, DON’T CUT IT!! And good luck fellas 🫡",

I’ve been doing 1 mg finasteride oral daily, 1 ml minoxidil twice daily, 1 biotin multivitamin daily and saw palmetto shampoo. I am continuing to microneedle with a 0.5 mm device I got on Amazon 2-3 times per week. I have been diligent—barely any missed doses of min and no missed doses of fin. \n\nThe progress photo shows slightly longer hair but not much. \n\nI am honestly shocked at my progress; I can’t believe I see hair in the mirror. I am still pretty bald and patchy(maybe more in real life than pics show) but I have hair! I wish I had done this in my 20s. Hoping this continues for the next few months/years.

    "body": "I’ve struggled the last 10- 15 years with my hair progressively getting thinner and thinner. Around 2020 it got significantly worse. I kept trying over the counter shampoos, supplements and minoxidil. I asked my doctor to refer me to a Dermatologist, waited almost a year for the appointment for it to last ten minutes and he told me it was stress and if I can’t stop stressing about my hair to go to a therapist, needless to say I left in tears. I felt so defeated, there was nothing I could do. \n\nA year later some drunk a**hole at a bar made fun of me for my hair and I absolutely broke down and fell into a depression. I didn’t want to go out, when I did go out all I could think about was my hair. Finally went to a new doctor and told her how much it was affecting my life. She referred me to a new dermatologist. Waited another year and FINALLY found someone that really listened and got a prescription, I was so happy leaving there. Six months later and I FINALLY feel comfortable in my own skin again, I don’t constantly stress about my hair. It’s not perfect but from where it was I couldn’t be happier.\n\nChanges from first picture to second:\n\nspironolactone 50 MG tablet\nminoxidil 2.5 MG tablet\nBiotin daily\nNutrafol\nUse Nioxin shampoo and conditioner\nMicrofiber towel to dry my hair. \n\n\n",

I’ve been diligently using leave in conditioner and minoxidil hair serum with biotin. My goal is to grow it past my hips and get it thicker. This is my natural hair color, no heat or dyes! Just braids. I’ve already noticed a difference in how it feels and moves, and no split ends :,) Wanted to share 🌻 If you want to know the products I’m using just let me know! \n\nI did an argan oil hair mask yesterday for about 7 hours.

I am so happy with the results so far and I know I still have another 6 months to go! Few things to note:\n\n- Month 6 photos taken at the gym with no styling products, and very sweaty.\n\n- I shaved my head at the one month mark with a .5mm electric razor as I got past the awkward phase.\n\n- I let my hair grow around month 3.\n\n- Current haircut is full length on top, with a fade starting at .5mm, with instructing the barber not to take the fade too high, so it does not show surgery scars.\n\n- At month 5 I was shedding a lot of hairs, maybe 15-30 in the shower / styling. I decided to trust the process and not freak out (although it was hard). It looks like it was just to grow stronger hairs and perhaps the new hair being off-cycle from the rest of my hair. I have not lost density, but rather seen an increase.",

    "body": "I've been dealing with hypothyroidism for my entire 39 years, but it was only last year -- and by accident -- that I found out that vitamin B7, aka biotin, a very common ingredient in supplements and nutrition shakes, can fuck up the numbers on your thyroid blood tests.\n\nLast year, I strongly felt my levels were off. I was cold, tired, dry skin, thin hair, the works. I had a blood test in February, results normal (serum TSH level 0.4mu/L -- the level the UK's health service considers normal is 0.35 to 4.9). \n\nAnother test in June, results normal (serum TSH level 1.5mu/L).\n\nIn November, I stopped taking all my supplements that contained biotin and -- most annoying! -- stopped drinking my Huel nutrition shakes which also have it in (I have yet to find a nutrition shake that DOESN'T include it, apart from pure protein shakes).\n\nBlood test result: 4.86. RIGHT at the other end of the scale!\n\nMy GP had never heard of biotin or this problem, and was very skeptical -- in fact she googled it right in front of me and expressed surprise when [a legit article on the government website appeared (PDF).](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/64998b7b831311001329636a/Levothyroxine_Letter.pdf) Ha!\n\nDespite having heard about the issue literally one second ago, she said a week off biotin wasn't enough and I'd need to quit it for an entire month. I disagreed with this as 90% of biotin is absorbed within 24 hours, and even if you're on a CRAZY high amount of biotin, [you only need to stop taking it for 72 hours before your blood test](https://myadlm.org/science-and-research/academy-guidance/biotin-interference-in-laboratory-tests). \n\nBut she wouldn't listen and so another month on the same too-low dose, freezing to death in frosty British weather, and another blood test finally.\n\nResult? 4.2 mu/L. I saw a different doctor this time (who also hadn't heard of the biotin issue) and he's increased my dosage to bring that number back down to the range where I feel functional (usually in the 1.5-2 range).\n\nSo, to summarise my 2024 thyroid blood test results:\n\nFebruary (with biotin): 0.4 \n\nJune (with biotin): 1.5\n\nNovember (a week off biotin): 4.86\n\nDecember (a month off biotin): 4.2\n\n  \nIn short, you REALLY need to make sure you're not taking any supplements or drinking any shakes that contain biotin when you get your levels tested, because it can fuck that shit ALL up. It doesn't seem to actually affect thyroxine absorption, just how the results show on your test, so you're not getting a true picture of your thyroid health.\n\nHowever, IMO you don't need to be off it for a month like I was -- a week is plenty long enough. But do look for supplements that don't contain it at all, because if you can take those instead, even better (I've now found vitamin D and iron supplements that don't contain it at all, but you'll take my shakes out of my cold, dead hands!).\n\nI will be testing again in six weeks on my higher dose (125mcg, from 100mcg) and will update again then. But in the meantime I hope this is helpful, because a lot of health professionals don't know about this problem, and it really does make a big difference. \n\nBe well!",

The problem is the biotin in the blood screws up the TEST for TSH. It doesn't actually screw up your TSH-- just the ability of standard test to measure it. \n\nBiotin is a B vitamin and water soluble. Excess amounts are not going to linger in your blood if you don't keep taking it. You'll always have a little in your blood because some is in food. The test is designed for normal levels.  I don't take hair/nail supplements, extra B or extra biotin specifically.  I still skip my multivitamin two days before the test also.   Honestly, if I took hair/nail, I'd skip it three days just to be safer!",

        "body": "I want to add something:  If you are worried about biotin affecting your TSH results, it looks like skipping biotin for 3 days *will be good* for most people taking 300 mg/day or less of biotin. (Some hair and nail have more.)  Skipping 1 day *may not be* enough for a multi vitamin (mine has 30 mg in it.)\n\nThis is based on:\n\nAssociation of Biotin Ingestion With Performance of Hormone and Nonhormone Assays in Healthy Adults.\n\nLi D et al.\n\n[https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/5818818](https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/5818818)\n\nThe key bit in their text\n\n>Biotin assay interference following discontinuation of biotin has been demonstrated at 24 hours and at 16 hours following a single 30-mg dose and 3 daily 100-mg doses, respecively. \n\nSo from that, skipping 24 hour wait might *not* be enough for a 30 mg dose.  My multivitamine contains 30 mg.\n\n>Falsely abnormal hormone levels *returned to norma*l 3 days after ceasing to take 300 mg of biotin in 3 daily doses and 2 days after ceasing to take up to 300 mg of biotin. \n\nFrom this, skipping 2 days seems enough if you take 300 mg biotin, but 3 days was required for 300 mg 3 times a day (which is 900 mg.) \n\n  \nSo, my personal take on this is I won't take my multivitamin with biotin (which is most) for at least 2 days before a TSH test. I don't take hair/nail or \"extra\". But if I did, I'd skip them for  at least 3 days.  My cheerios don't contain biotin, so I'll take that. :)",

A multivitamin might still work for you since it has B5 as well to balance things out. Usually 2,5 mg's is mentioned as the upper limit for acne safe biotin intake. Biotin belongs to the B family (B7).\n\nI used to avoid biotin and B12 religiously and now I've been introducing both in smaller amounts without any acne issues. I know acne is scary but remember B vitamins are still important for your health - you might cause other health issues if you limit your B intake too much.",
