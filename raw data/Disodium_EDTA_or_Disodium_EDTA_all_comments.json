    "body": "Naisipan kong dumaan sa Watsons ngayong araw para bumili ng lotion, dahil paubos na yung ginagamit ko. Nakita ko tong lotion na 'to ng Luxe Organix na naka B1T1 for Php 405, kaya naisipan kong subukan. 2 variant yung binili ko, itong Retinol + Gluta, tsaka yung Niacinamide + Arbutin. \n\nTLDR:\n\nMay microfoaming, malakas ang fragrance, heavier skin feel kumpara sa ibang serum lotions sa Market, mali-mali ang IL, mislabeled dahil imbes na retinol, Retinyl Palmitate ang laman base sa IL. \n\nUnahin muna nating tingnan ang packaging. Sa unang tingin, di nalalayo material sa packaging ng mga serum lotion ng Vaseline. Tho, yung sa Vaseline, rounded yung tabas ng seal ng tube sa both sides, samantalang itong sa LO ay pointed. \n\nSa itsura naman mismo ng laman, off-white na medyo madilaw yung kulay ng lotion. Medyo clumpy din yung itsura pagkalabas nito sa tube, at madali ding mag-break yung emulsion upon skin contact. Malakas yung fragrance nya na dominated ng floral notes. Unang naisip ko nga nung naamoy ko e amoy poon, dahil sa sobrang floral. \n\nMedyo matagal ipahid sa balat, kumpara sa ibang serum lotion na nasubukan ko na. Naka-observe din ako ng microfoaming during application nitong lotion. Ang microfoaming ito yung nagkakaroon ng puti-puting streaks sa balat habang pinapahid ang isang product, kadalasan mga emulsion gaya ng lotion at creams. Ang microfoaming ay dulot ng pagkaka-trap ng air sa product habang ipinapahid sa balat. Kung ikukumpara ko ito sa ibang serum lotion na nagamit ko na (Vaseline Gluta-Hya Serum Burst Lotion, Smoochkins Nia-Arbutin Nano White Serum Lotion), ito yung pinaka heavy ang skin feel. Hindi ko masyadong na-feel yung pagka serum lotion. And lastly naka-experience din ako ng pamumula at pantal sa braso ko after ko gamitin itong lotion na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list. \n\nWater (Aqua), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Myristate, Fragrance, C15-19 Alkane, Stearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Triethanolamine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Glutathione, Polysorbate 20, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ceramide NP, Mannitol, Pentylene Glycol, CI19140, Phosphatidylcholine, Retinyl Palmitate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Polyglyceryl-10,  Citric Acid, Tocopherol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nHindi na talaga nawala ang mga errors sa IL ng mga local products. Di yata talaga uso ipa-check man lang sa regulatory personnel ang IL na ilalagay sa final layout ng packaging bago ang ipa-mass printing. Para sa product na ito, hindi Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol ang tamang INCI name, kung hindi Cetearyl Alcohol. Next, Polyglyceryl-10, what? Incomplete yung ingredient name. Ang daming Polyglyceryl-10 esters na nag eexist, wag nyo na kami paghulain. (Side Note: Ang Polyglyceryl-10 esters ay kadalasang ginagamit as non-ionic emulsifier sa cosmetics.). \n\nPangalawa kong napansin, CI19140. Ang CI19140 ay isang dye na kilala din bilang Tartrazine Yellow or FD&C Yellow #5. Ito yung nagbigay ng medyo madilaw na kulay sa lotion na ito. Konektado ito sa kasunod kong punto. \n\nIkatlo, bakit Retinyl Palmitate ang nakalista dito sa IL? Kaya nyo ba nilagyan ng Yellow #5 ang lotion na ito para magmukhang may retinol, kasi nakakapagdulot ng paninilaw sa mga product ang retinol kapag ihinalo ito? Ngayon, ano ba ang problema kung retinyl palmitate ang nakalagay, imbes na retinol? Ito kasi yun: maliban sa obvious na mislabelling sa product na ito, mas mababa ang potency ng retinyl palmitate kaysa sa retinol. Sa buong retinoid family, ang mga retinyl esters kagaya ng retinyl palmitate ang may pinakamababang potency, dahil kailangan pa nito ng isang extra conversion step (retinyl palmitate -> retinol). Tandaan, ang mga retinoids, kailangang ma-convert into retinoic acid para ma-activate ang retinoic acid receptors natin sa balat at makuha ang benefits. \n\nRetinyl esters -> Retinol -> Retinaldehyde -> Retinoic Acid\n\nKada conversion step, bumababa ang potency ng isang retinoid, kaya sa kaso ng retinyl palmitate, na isang retinyl ester, eto ang may pinakamababang potency. \n\nMay peptides din pala itong lotion na ito: Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9 at Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11.\n\nAng acetyl tetrapeptide-9 ay isang signaling peptide na nagbibigay ng message sa fibroblasts sa ating dermis na magproduce ng collagen (specifically Collagen Type 1) at proteoglycans, na mahalaga para mapanatili ang structure at mapanatiling tight (hindi sagging) ang balat natin.  Nakakatulong din itong mabawasan ang appearance ng fine lines sa mukha, dahil na rin sa stimulation ng collagen at proteoglycan production. \n\nKung ang dermis ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, ang epidermis naman ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-11. Kagaya ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, signaling peptide din ito na nagbibigay ng mensahe sa epidermis na mag-synthesize o magproduce ng Syndecan-1 at Collagen XVII. Kapag mataas ang dalawang ito sa balat, nag-iimprove ang elasticity ng balat. \n\nKaramihan ng mga nabanggit na benepisyo ng dalawang peptides na ito ay base pa lamang sa mga in-vitro studies na naisagawa na. Wala pang gaanong in-vivo clinical studies na lumabas kaya medyo skeptical pa din ako sa mga peptides na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo lastly sa product claims. \n\n* Retinol + Gluta\n\n* Whitening Serum Lotion\n\n* Lightening\n\n* Firming\n\n* Hydrating\n\n* 24 hr Supple Smooth\n\n* 3X Peptide Youth Repair + Hyaluronic Bright + Ceramide Glow\n\nUnang claim pa lang, sablay na. Wala namang retinol tong lotion na 'to. Pinaglololoko ako nitong LO e. \n\nSa claim na lightening at whitening, medyo duda ako. Mukhang glutathione lang ang pwedeng masabi ng brand na ito na skin lightening ingredient. Pero duda ako sa efficacy ng glutathione na makapagpa lighten ng skin topically. Maraming limitations yung mga published studies tungkol sa efficacy ng topically applied gluta, gaya ng mababang bilang ng participants sa studies at sobrang iksi na study period. \n\nSa claim na firming, mukhang inilagay ito gawa nung mga peptides. Sa hydrating claim, meron namang hydrating ingredients (glycerin, hyaluronic acid derivatives, olive oil, Plukenetia Volubilis oil, tsaka Ceramide NP). Same din dun sa mga sumunod na claims, dahil sa presence ng mga nabanggit na ingredients. \n\n\nFinal words:\n\nHindi ako masaya sa nabili kong lotion na 'to. Hindi kasing lightweight at fast absorbing nung iba kong nasubukan na serum lotions. Amoy poon yung fragrance. May microfoaming during application. Nagkapantal ako sa braso. Mali-mali ang IL. Pero yung pinaka disappointing sa lotion na 'to e yung claim na may retinol daw, pero retinyl palmitate lang ang nasa ingredient list. May paglalagay pa ng yellow dye para magmukhang may retinol. Napakalaking red flag para sa akin ang pagmi-mislabel ng product.\n\nAyun lang. Salamat sa pagbabasa. At laging maging mapanuri sa mga binibili at balak nating gamitin na products. \n\n",

Yellow dye appears to have been added to the lotion to give the appearance of fully evolved retinol being an ingredient as retinol usually makes creams look yellow.\n* The peptides used claim to target fine lines and elasticity, but only proven by in-vitro studies (i.e. in controlled lab environments) vs. in-vivo (i.e. on living organisms)\n\nThank you for this in-depth review, skincare\\_chemist19!

    "body": "Hey everyone! Due to a recent posting of misinformation being spread on here, excessive worrying over ingredients, and people PMing me for advice I figured I would just make a post about this to help other people with similar questions\n\nFor background, I am a chemist- in particular a biochemist. I used to work in a research area that focused on mineral/ion- skin absorption. I'll try to hit the ones that aren't in the side bar already and separate them out by category for easy viewing. Let me know if I missed any big ones!\n\n**Emulsifiers - keep oil/water based chemicals from separating in products**\n\nMost common products I see contain polysorbates, laureth-4, glyceryl monostearate (also pearlescent agent)\nlauramide DEA (also foam booster), or potassium cetyl sulfate. There's also stearic acid that also helps with cleansing. These aren't necessarily bad for you nor are they good for you. They're kinda meh ingredients that exist to make the product work \n\n**Preservatives- extend their shelf life and are anti microbial**\n \nparabens- these get a lot of flack but there isn't that much research confirming their 'toxicity'. The [original study] (http://www.dr-baumann.ca/science/Concentrations%20of%20Parabens%20in%20Human%20Breast.pdf) that brought them into the spotlight was over hyped by the media and dozens of other studies done afterwards have yet to find a definite link to cancer or other diseases. These are however very great preservatives\n\nBenzyl alcohol containing products has been known to dry some people out due to it's status as an alcohol. Aside from a preservative it's also used as a ph balancer\n\nformaldehyde- if you see this in a product, you may want to be wary. The World Health Organization has determined this to be a carcinogen; however whether trace amounts are as bad for you is still unknown\n\n tetrasodium EDTA/ disodium EDTA- normally these are used to draw metals out of the blood, but in terms of skincare, both work to stabilize the product by binding other chemicals. Only concern with this one is that it's an environmental hazard \n\nPhenoxyethanol -  an antimicrobial \n\nethylhexylglycerin - helps with eczema and also works for some people with rosacea \n\n**Moisturizers : Lipid thickeners - give product it's creamy consistency**\n\ncetyl alcohol, stearic acid and carnauba wax are the big ones- aren't bad, rarely cause things like breakouts for most people. These are also good at protecting the moisture barrier from water loss by forming a 'seal' \n\n**Moisturizers : Natural thickeners - come from nature, usually work as humectants (think hyaluronic acid)**\n\nhydroxyethyl cellulose, guar gum, xanthan gum and gelatin are the most popular\n\n**Moisturizers: Mineral thickeners - also natural, absorb both oils and retain water**\n\nmagnesium aluminium silicate, silica and bentonite are the big ones here. A lot of clay masks and some silicone based (neutrogena) sunscreens are apart of this category. Silicone based sunscreens are great for those who's skin can handle them since they keep oils/shine in check while also preventing your skin from overdrying\n\n**Moisturizers: synthetic thickeners - used in a lot of gel type products and some of the rich/smooth white creams**\n\ncarbomer, cetyl palmitate, and ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate are common ones\n\n**Emollients - soften the skin by preventing water loss, work as humectants,  definetly want these in your routine**\n\nbeeswax, olive oil, coconut oil and lanolin, petroleum jelly, mineral oil, glycerin, zinc oxide, butyl stearate and diglycol laurate , urea, glycerol, propylene glycol or lactic acid are big ones here.\n\nSome of these are termed 'comedogenic' like coconut oil but many many people don't break out from them so that's a pretty arbitrary rating imo\n\n**Edit- here’s a couple more I forgot to add that are sunscreen relevant**\n\n**Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate-** protects against UVB and not UVA rays. It is not very stable either, when exposed to sunlight, it kind of breaks down and loses its effectiveness (not instantly, but over time - it loses 10% of its SPF protection ability within 35 mins)\n\n**Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane-**  famous Avobenzone. It is the only globally available chemical sunscreen agent that protects against UVA. It is the global gold standard of UVA protection and is the most used UVA sunscreen in the world. Suprisingly it’s in moisturizers too.The problem with it, though, is that it is not photostable and degrades in the sunlight. Wikipedia says that avobenzone loses 36% of its UV-absorption capacity after just one hour of sunlight",

Japanese has a more peachy/salmon color compared to the whitish USA one.\n2. Japanese is thicker texture and holds shape compared to the USA as its more watery and slumps down on itself.\n3. Totally different flavor! Japanese has a tang/kick -brightness to it while USA one is more eggy and blander.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConclusion: No they are not the same and ingredients matter.\n\nEdit: I have come to learn that Costco sells Kewpie that is manufactured by the same USA company but has different ingredient list which contains MSG! Thanks u/Anfini !\nI’m not going to buy a family size Kewpie to compare and instead I will take Anfini’s opinion to heart and believe it’s not great either.\n\nCostco ingredients: SOYBEAN OIL, EGG YOLKS, WATER, DISTILLED VINEGAR, SALT, RED WINE VINEGAR, APPLE CIDER VINEGAR, MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE, MUSTARD FLOUR, SUGAR, CALCIUM DISODIUM EDTA, NATURAL FLAVORS\n\nUSA ingredient: SOYBEAN OIL, EGG YOLKS, WATER, DISTILLED VINEGAR, SALT, SUGAR, MUSTARD FLOUR, RED WINE VINEGAR, YEAST EXTRACT, NATURAL FLAVORS\n\nJapan ingredient list: VEGETABLE OIL (CANOLA OIL, SOYBEAN OIL), EGG YOLK, VINEGAR, SALT, MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE, SPICE, NATURAL FLAVOR",

Yeast extract. Yet despite the no-MSG claim, yeast extract is one of the ingredients (including tomatoes and cheeses) in which MSG \"occurs naturally,\" according to the U.S. Food and Drug Adminstration.\n\n\"While FDA requires that these products be listed on the ingredient panel, the agency does not require the label to also specify that they naturally contain MSG,\" reads the FDA web page on monosodium glutamate. \"However, foods with any ingredient that naturally contains MSG cannot claim 'No MSG' or 'No added MSG' on their packaging.\"\n\nAnd, indeed, the US Kewpie bottle label avoids making those claims. Asked to elaborate on his early email about the no-MSG claim, Dunseith said there was a distinction between naturally occuring monosodium glutamate, like yeast extract, and manufactured MSG.\n\nhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/dining/ct-tasting-kewpie-made-in-usa-mayo-20170609-story.html",

    "body": "Timeout muna sa review ng mga serum lotions dahil isang panibagong sunscreen na naman ang irereview ko ngayong araw. Ito ang Kagayaku Premium Tinted Sunscreen SPF 70 PA++++. Ang tagal kong hinintay nitong sunscreen na ito bago mai-deliver: inorder ko ng week ng April 21, dumating ng May 3. Uuriratin ko itong sunscreen na ito at titingnan kung worth it bang bilhin o waste of money lang. \n\nTLDR:\n\nHindi dapat tawaging premium ang sunscreen na ito. Tadtad ng errors ang ingredient list. Halatang di dumaan sa review bago i-mass print ang box at tube. Aside sa errors, magkaiba ang IL na nasa tube at nung nasa box. Plus, sobrang sakit sa mata basahin nung text na nasa back panel ng box, dahil sa white font na ginamit. And walang SPF test report. Sayang lang pera nyo sa product na ito. \n\nNabili ko itong sunscreen na ito sa halagang 295 pesos sa Tiktok. Out of the box, ang itsura ng tube nito ay reminiscent sa tube packaging ng SKIN1004 na sunscreen. From the tube, pump, pati na din sa cap nung pump. Pero walang silbi yung pump nito, hindi nadidispense yung laman kahit na makailang ulit na akong nagpump. So, no choice na ako kundi alisin ang pump cap at i-squeeze yung tube para lumabas yung laman. Apparently, masyadong viscous yung laman para lumabas sa pump. Halatang may mis-match sa characteristics nung content sa packaging na pinili. \n\nThe bulk product itself, sabi ko nga e viscous, pero nagbebreak ang emulsion upon skin contact. Yung binili ko e kulay brown, and ang appearance ng product is parang chocolate mousse. Yung amoy nito ay may chocolate gourmand notes, as well as konting floral notes. Lightweight ang product, madaling mag-spread sa balat, may light to medium coverage, walang whitecast, at kapag nag set na sa balat e wala akong nafi-feel. \n\nTumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list ng product na ito. Pinasakit ng IL ng product na ito ang mga mata ko. First, dahil ang hirap basahin ng text sa likod ng box dahil sa white font on top ng light beige background. Kinailangan ko pang i-edit yung contract settings nung pic para lang mabasa yung IL ng box. Second, dahil magkaiba ang IL na nasa box at nung nasa tube.\n\nIngredient list ng nasa tube:\n\nWater, Disodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate (and) C20-22 Alcohols, PEG-100 Stearate (and) Glyceryl Stearate, Polysorbate 60, Octocrylene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diisopropyl Adipate (and) Diisopropyl Sebacate (and) Propylene, C15-19 Alkane, Dimethicone, Titanium Dioxide (and) Alumina (and) Methicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate, CI 77491, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance\n\nEto naman ang IL na nasa box:\n\nWater, Disodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, C20-2 Alkyl Phosphate (and) C20-22 Alcohols, PEG-100 Stearate (and) Glyceryl Stearate, Polusorbate 60, Octocrylene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diisopropyl Adipate (and) Diisopropyl Sebacate (and) Propylene, C15-19 Alkane, Dimethicone, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate (and) Zinc Oxide (and) Polyhydroxystearic Acid (and) Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Titanium Dioxide (and) Alumina (and) Methicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate, Copolymer (and) Isohexadecane (and) Polysorbate 60 Iron Oxides (C.I. 77491) (and) Diisopropyl Dimer Dilinoleate (and) Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate (and) Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone (and) Hexyl Laurate (and) Perfluorohexylethyl Triethoxysilane, Titanium Dioxide (and) Diisopropyl Dimer Dilinoleate (and) Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate (and) Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone (and) Hexyl Laurate (and) Perfluorohexylethyl Triethoxysilane, Phenoxyethanol (and) Chlorphenesin (and) Aqua (and) Glycerin, Water, Gosypium Herbaceum (Cotton) Seed Extract (and) Punica Granatum Seed Extract (and) Glycerin (and) Trehalose (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Fructoligosaccharides (and) Water (Aqua) (and) Phytic Acid, Parfum (Fragrance) \n\nWhoo! Inang yan, ang sakit basahin at ilista nung IL. Sa dami ng mali sa IL nito, hindi ko alam kung ano uunahin ko. Pero dahil nasimulan ko na, sasagarin ko na:\n\n1. Dahil karamihan ng mga ingredients na ginamit dito ay complex mixtures (mapapansin nyo yung mga ingredient na tadtad ng (and) sa pagitan), either tinamad yung gumawa ng IL or just plain incompetent. Ang siste kasi kapag gumamit ng mixtures as ingredients sa isang formulation, kailangang alamin ang % composition nung mixture, then imutiply yung % ng every component ng mixture sa % nung ingredient mixture na ginamit sa formulation. Either tinamad na alamin at i-compute yung exact % nung mga components nung ingredient mixtures or hindi ito alam kung pano gawin nung gumawa ng IL. \n\n2. Hindi ko din alam kung anong trip nung gumawa ng IL at bakit inilagay as 2nd ingredient ang Disodium EDTA (chelating agent) at 3rd ingredient ang Triethanolamine (pH adjuster / neutralizing agent). Ang typical usage rate ng Disodium EDTA is usually below 1% (0.05% - 0.1%), samantalang ang Triethanolamine ay may maximum allowed use na 2.5% according sa Annex III ng ASEAN Cosmetic Directive. \n\n3. Sa tube IL, walang Zinc Oxide. Pero pagdating sa box IL, meron na. So, ano ba talaga, meron o walang Zinc Oxide sa sunscreen na ito? \n\n4. Since tinted sunscreen ito, expected ang presence ng Titanium dioxide, Iron Oxide Red (C.I. 77491), Iron Oxide Yellow (C.I. 77492), at Iron Oxide Black (C.I. 77499). Pero bakit sa IL ng tube at box, wala ang Iron Oxide Yellow at Iron Oxide Black? Yung totoo? \n\n5. Sa IL ng tube, Phenoxyethanol lang ang preservative. Pero pagdating sa IL ng box, may Chlorphenesin na.\n\n6. Sa IL ng box: Polusorbate 60. Polysorbate 60 dapat yan. Pero weirdly, tama naman nung naulit sa Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate, Copolymer (and) Isohexadecane (and) Polysorbate 60 (pero wala dapat comma after Taurate:   Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer ang tama) \n\n7. Sa IL ng box: entry should be Fructooligosaccharides, hindi Fructoligosaccharides. \n\n8. Sa IL ng box: Diisopropyl Adipate (and) Diisopropyl Sebacate (and) Propylene.  Propylene ano? Wala kaming time hulaan kung ano yan. \n\nIto na ata ang pinakamaraming mali na nakita ko sa IL ng isang product na na-launch sa Market. Sa dami ng pera (daw) ng brand owner nito, di man lang naisip mag-hire ng regulatory consultant man lang para ma-check yung IL ng product nya. \n\nNgayon, punta naman tayo sa product claims. \n\n* SPF 70 PA++++ UVA/UVB Protection\n\n* Tone Adapt Technology\n\n* Lightweight\n\n* Anti Aging\n\n* Whitening\n\nSa SPF claims, wala pa akong makita na SPF test result nito from the brand owner, kaya di ko muna paniniwalaan itong claim nila na ito. \n\nSa claim na Tone Adapt Technology, kalokohan yan. Marketing term lang yang tone adapt technology na yan. \n\nIn terms of being lightweight, yes lightweight naman ito nung sinubukan ko. For anti aging, pwede naman, since sunscreens helps with aging, specifically sa photoaging. But since wala pa akong makita na SPF test report ng product na ito, di muna ako agree sa claim na ito. In terms naman ng whitening, wala akong makita sa IL na skin whitening actives sa product na ito. \n\nFinal words:\n\nDi ko alam kung saan kumuha ng tigas ng mukha yung brand owner na tawaging \"Premium\" itong sunscreen na ito. Ni hindi nga nagawa ang bare minimum na i-check ang mga nakasulat na text sa packaging bago magproceed sa mass printing. Sa dami ng pera (daw) ng brand owner, mano man lang na nag-hire ng consultant para i-check yan. Tapos wala pang SPF test report. Sana nagpa-conduct sila ng 3rd party in-vivo SPF test, meron naman nag ooffer nyan dito sa Pilipinas. Afford naman nung brand owner, mayaman naman (daw) sya e. E di sana solid yung claim nyang SPF 70 PA ++++.\n\nHindi ko alam kung seryoso ba talaga yung brand sa paglaunch nitong product na ito o nagpapapansin lang, kasi sa buong pagwowork ko sa cosmetics industry, ngayon lang ako naka-encounter ng ganitong klase ng product na hindi ko mawari kung pinag isipan ba o napagtripan lang. \n\nSorry, pero first time ko sasabihin to sa pagrereview ko: Wag kayo magpabudol sa product na to. Masasayang lang pera nyo, marami pang ibang sunscreen jan na mas maganda. \n\nAyun lang. Maraming salamat sa pagbabasa. At laging maging mapanuri sa mga binibili at balak nating gamitin na products.

Has \"great skin moisturising properties\" according to [Incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dipropylene-glycol). Safety rating of 1-2 (very safe) on [Cosdna](https://www.cosdna.com/eng/b05d771602.html). This is likely nothing to worry about unless you already know you have a sensitivity, as it is mostly there to keep the formula feeling elegant and seems to be mildly hydrating. \n\n//\n\nHYALURONIC ACID FERMENT FILTRATE \n\nNew kind of hyaluronic acid that Hada Labo claims will \"help fortify the skins moisture barrier to help skin looking plump and supple\". This is the most controversial addition as many people are sensitive to ferments and this product will unfortunately now be unsuitable for them, which is a real shame. However, if you are someone who enjoys ferments, this might sound rather exciting. I couldn't find much info when I searched \"fermented hyaluronic acid\", but Ratzilla's list seems to suggest that the HA has been fermented with Lactococcus bacteria, which is proposed to \"positively influence both the speed and quality of epidermal growth, resulting in better barrier function and overall skin quality\" ([Incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/lactococcus-ferment-lysate)). I'm not convinced a difference in effect will be extremely noticeable alongside the 6 other kinds of HA but I expect it will work well for plumping and improving the health and appearance of the skin regardless. \n\n//\n\nHYDROLIZED SODIUM HYALURONATE \n\nThis is a super, super tiny (low molecular weight) version of hyaluronic acid, which is intended to penetrate even deeper into the skin and moisturise deeper than standard HA. If your skin wasn't bothered by the Hydrolized hyaluronic acid (another smaller molecule form) in the original formula (still in this one too!) then you might well not be bothered by this version too. Source: [incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-sodium-hyaluronate)\n\n//\n\nPROPANEDIOL \n\nCommonly used solvent, humectant and emollient. In short, makes formulas more cosmetically elegant and also helps to pull moisture into the skin and keep it there. Considered very safe and a non-irritant. Further reading: [byrdie article](https://www.byrdie.com/propanediol-for-skin-4773491) [paula's choice ](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/uncategorized/propanediol.html)\n\n//\n\nCAPRYLHYDROXAMIC ACID \n\nAn anti-fungal amino acid derived from coconut oil that acts as a preservative. Limited data regarding safety, but Honest Beauty claims it is safer and less harsh than other commonly used preservatives (take this with a grain of salt as Honest Beauty has an agenda to push and so will be biased). Sources: [truth in ageing ](https://www.truthinaging.com/ingredients/caprylhydroxamic-acid)\n[honest beauty ](https://www.honest.com/blog/wellness/ingredients/what-is-caprylhydroxamic-acid/13775.html)\n\n//\n\nHYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE \n\nUsed as a thickener in cosmetics, gives a nice slippy, gel-like feeling. Water soluble, regarded as safe. \n\n//\n\nXANTHAN GUM \n\nExtremely commonly used thickener and stabiliser. Unlikely to be an issue unless you have a specific sensitivity to it. \n\n\n//\n\nAnd now, let's look at the changes in the top few ingredients: \n\n• The top ingredients, which I usually regard as the most important, have changed in that normal Glycerin has been removed and replaced with Diglycerin, and it's now the 7th ingredient as opposed to the 3rd. Diglycerin is not much different as both are powerful hydrators, but Diglycerin supposedly \"penetrates slower into the skin but gives longer lasting moisture and less sticky, better skin-feel.\" Source: [incidecoder ](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/diglycerin) This might be good for people who have tried the original Premium and found it to be too sticky on the skin! However, due to it being moved lower down, the impact might not be too obvious here. \n\n• Pentylene Glycol has been bumped way up the list from 16th to 4th! This is another thickening ingredient that is key to the sensory feeling of the product, and according to incidecoder its also a moisturiser and helps to hydrate and smooth the skin. However, [the derm review ](https://thedermreview.com/pentylene-glycol/) actually claims it doesn't have any specific skin benefits, but is at least safe and non-irritating. I personally would rather have kept a higher concentration of glycerin or diglycerin in the product as opposed to this as I think they're more intensely moisturising/hydrating to the skin. \n\n• On the other hand, urea has been moved from the 5th ingredient to the 3rd, where glycerin was previously. From [incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethyl-urea): \"A derivative of Urea, that works as a strong moisturizer and humectant meaning that it helps the skin to cling onto water and thus to make it hydrated and elastic.\n\nAccording to manufacturer's data,  Hydroxyethyl Urea has a similar moisturizing ability to glycerin (measured at 5%), but it feels nicer on the skin as it is non-sticky and non-tacky and gives a lubricous and moist feeling to the skin.\" \n\nSo, perhaps this formulation could actually remain equally as hydrating, if not more so, but less sticky due to the removal of glycerin? \n\n//\n\nTLDR: \n\nSo, apart from the ferment all the new additions are commonly used ingredients - nothing toxic, irritating or comodegenic! In theory (best case scenario) it should be even more hydrating due to the extra two forms of hyaluronic acid, and potentially less sticky due to the removal of glycerin and higher concentrations of urea and Diglycerin! Worst case scenario is that the concentrations of HA have been lowered and it won't have the same deeply plumping effect, only time will tell. \n\nThis is getting very long and my thumbs are tired so I'm going to end this post here even though I could potentially go on, hopefully this helps some people make an informed decision on whether they'd like to try the new formulation. I personally have already ordered a bottle as I'm not concerned by the addition of ferments and in general it doesn't look bad at all. Fingers crossed it's somehow even better than the original!!",

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

    "body": "I know CeraVe in the tub is quite popular here, but I just wanted to provide a quick overview of other CeraVe moisturizers for those who aren't familiar.\n\n**NOTE**: All CeraVe moisturizers contain cetearyl alcohol/cetyl alcohol, which may cause breakouts to those who have a sensitivity to fatty alcohols.\n\n**Cerave Moisturizer Overview**\n\n[**Cerave Moisturizing Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/moisturizing-cream) (also known as Cerave \"in the tub\") is a thick, creamy moisturizer with ceramides, hyaluronic acid and petrolatum.\n\n[**Cerave Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/moisturizing-lotion) comes in a bottle and is a thinner consistency. It also has ceramides and hyaluronic acid but no petrolatum.\n\n[**Cerave AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/am-facial-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a small pump bottle and has a thick, creamy (slightly greasy) texture. It is SPF 30 and contains the following active suncare ingredients: Homosalate (12% - for UVB protection), Octinoxate (7.5% - for UVB protection), Octocrylene (2% - for UVB protection), Zinc Oxide (3.5% - for UVA protection). It also contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/pm-facial-moisturizing-lotion) (my fave) comes in a small pump bottle and is a silky/gel texture. It contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and places more focus on chemical exfoliation. Notable ingredients are mineral oil, ammonium lactate (similar to lactic acid), salicyclic acid, ceramides and a lower concentration of hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-cream) comes in a tub and is a thicker version of the SA lotion and contains similar ingredients with the addition of niacinamide.\n\n[**Cerave Skin Renewing Night Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/skin-renewing-night-cream) comes in a tub and contains shea butter, ceramides, niacinamide, peptides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and contains niacinamide, ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and allantoin (an anti-irritant derived from urea). \n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-cream) comes in a tub and contains glycerin, petrolatum, ceramides and hyaluronic acid. No niacinamide or allantoin in this one.\n\n**Notable Ingredient Overview**\n\n**Ceramides**: Naturally occurring, long chains of skin lipids (fats) that are major structural components of the skin’s outer layers. Skin as a barrier system inhibits water movement via its extracellular matrix, which has a unique composition of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% free fatty acids. Together, these lipids form what researchers refer to as \"crystalline lamellar structures\". Ceramides are necessary for the skin’s water-retention capacity as well as for barrier repair and cell regulation. Adding ceramides to skin-care products can help to restore the skin’s barrier system.\n\n**Hyaluronic acid**: Component of skin tissue that is used in skin-care products as a good skin-identical ingredient. Hyaluronic acid can boost skin's moisture content, reduce inflammation, have cell-communicating abilities, and help prevent moisture loss.\n\n**Niacinamide**: Also known as vitamin B3 and nicotinic acid, niacinamide is a potent cell-communicating ingredient that offers multiple benefits for aging skin. Assuming skin is being protected from sun exposure, niacinamide can improve skin's elasticity, dramatically enhance its barrier function, help erase discolorations, and revive skin's healthy tone and texture.\n\n**Ammonium Lactate:** Ammonium lactate is a mix of lactic acid and ammonium hydroxide. It is used as a skin moisturizer lotion to treat dry, scaly, itchy skin. Those who are using it should avoid exposure to sunlight or artificial UV rays, such as sunlamps or tanning beds. Ammonium lactate makes skin more sensitive to sunlight. Skin is more likely to sunburn. Use sunblock and wear clothes when exposed to sunlight.\n\n**Salicylic acid**: Referred to as beta hydroxy acid (BHA), it is a multifunctional ingredient that addresses many of the systemic causes of blemishes. For decades dermatologists have been prescribing salicylic acid as an exceedingly effective keratolytic (exfoliant), but it also is an anti-irritant This is because salicylic acid is a derivative of aspirin (both are salicylates—aspirin’s technical name is acetylsalicylic acid), and so it also functions as an anti-inflammatory.\n\n**Shea butter**: A plant lipid extracted from the karite tree that is used as an emollient in cosmetics. Shea butter is a rich source of antioxidants.\n\n**Ingredient Lists**\n\n> **CeraVe Moisturizing Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n>\n> **CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Active Ingredients: Homosalate (12%), Octinoxate (7.5%), Octocrylene (2%), Zinc Oxide (3.5%). \n> Inactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate and Boron Nitride, Dimethicone, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Hyaluronic Acid, Phytosphingosine, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n> \n> **CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Renewing SA Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Mineral Oil, Ammonium Lactate, Salicylic Acid, Trolamine, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 in Corn Oil), Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Dimethicone 360, Methylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Propylparaben, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Renewing SA Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ammonium Lactate, Salicylic Acid, Triethanolamine, Cetyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 in Corn Oil), Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Methylparaben, Edetate Disodium, Propylparaben, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Glyceryl stearate SE, Stearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Saccharide Isomerate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterols, Ceramide 6 II, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 1, Niacinamide, Hyaluronic  Acid, Caprooyl Tetrapeptide-3, Tripeptide-1, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Tocopherol, Allantoin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Phytosphingosine, Dextran, Xanthan Gum\n>\n>**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n>\n>Purified Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetostearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Emulsifying Wax, Niacinamide, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lauric Acid, Zinc Citrate, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Arginine PCA, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, EDTA, Sodium PCA, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer\n>\n>**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**\n>\n>Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Petrolatum, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nHopefully this information will be useful to people interested in trying Cerave.",

(And a few water resistant makeup products that I admittedly tend to forget about.) They’re currently marketing their color-correcting sunscreens, [Allie Color Tuning UV](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-color-tuning-uv/),^(E) quite heavily as a foundation alternative that also provides UV protection. Aside from the Color Tuning line, which was released on February 16, 2021, all of the current sunscreens were released on February 16, 2020 (2020 formula). The previous version of the Allie gel, [Allie Extra UV Gel](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-gel-spf50/)^(E) (without the “N”), was released on February 16, 2018 (2018 formula), and all the presently discontinued formulations released in 2018 and 2019 were also rated SPF 50+ PA++++.\n\nI’ve been using the Allie gel for nearly a decade now, starting with [the second formulation](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-gel-mineral-moist-n/)^(E) released in 2012. [This 2013 article](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/japan-pa-system-for-uva-protection-revised/) from RatzillaCosme reminded me that I picked it up in the first place because it was one of the first sunscreens to be labelled PA++++. I do still try out other sunscreens from time to time, but I always have a tube of the Allie gel open concurrently with anything else I use. I’ve posted about the difference between the 2018 and 2020 formulas [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/gkgwm8/sunscreen_kanebo_allie_februaryapril_2020_new/), and reviews of each version [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/bz8r9t/japanese_sunscreens_allie_extra_uv_gel_highlight/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/jmkjlk/japanese_sunscreens_pt_2_allie_extra_uv_gel_n/), with an update to the 2020 review coming up.\n\n# On testing and reformulations\n\nAfter learning about the loophole in Korean law through [Odile Monod’s video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC8r3S0i0Ro) (via u/bloominglace’s [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mvajyp/korean_sunscreen_controversy_industry/)) and [Instagram Highlights](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3OTA0MjgzMTIwODUyNTQ4?story_media_id=2553999541407826596_1588058418) (via u/FrenchbunnyG’s [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mvajyp/korean_sunscreen_controversy_industry/gvbbsmz) in the same post), I tried to find information about the laws surrounding SPF/PA testing for reformulated products in Japan (because I live in Japan and therefore use Japanese sunscreens) but kept getting a bunch of hits about testing methods in general, and gave up trying to sift through it all.\n\nThe only product I personally really care about is the Allie gel, so I wrote to Kanebo directly and asked whether they test their reformulated products individually, with the 2018 and 2020 formulas of the Allie gel as an example, or whether their test results are carried over across formulations. Their response as of April 26, 2021 is that they test each version separately (“SPF/PA値の測定に関しまして、それぞれ測定しております”).\n\nI don’t know whether the same goes for all companies in Japan or not, or even for all Kao/Kanebo brands, but that’s one less thing for Allie users to worry about.\n\n*—And after leaving this sitting in my drafts for a couple of weeks, I am adding that* u/ysy_heart *has posted* [*this*](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/n8afq7/discussiondirector_of_japan_cosmetic_industry/) *about what the director of Japan Cosmetic Industry Association said about what their guidelines are on this subject.*\n\n# Hong Kong Consumer Council (October 2020)\n\nIn [the October 2020 report by the Hong Kong Consumer Council](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/jj0n81/sun_care_test_report_of_30_sunscreen_products/)^(E/TC) that everyone keeps referring to, the 2018 formula of the Allie gel (as seen in [the photo](https://imgur.com/seDmooL) published with the report) was rated SPF 61.7 PPD 9.8 (PA+++).\n\n*I’ll post a simplified version of [the results table](https://imgur.com/fPhhBUm)^(E/TC) in the comments, mostly for my own convenience.

However, the current standard for SPF testing in Japan is [ISO 24444:2019](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24444:ed-2:v1:en),^(E) effective as of February 21, 2020 according to [this notice](https://www.jcia.org/user/common/download/business/guideline/spf/SPF-jcia-r020221.pdf)^(J) (linked from [this page](https://www.jcia.org/user/business/guideline/spf)^(J)) issued by the [Japan Cosmetic Industry Association](https://www.jcia.org/en/)^(E) (JCIA)—or maybe it was also accepted before then? JCIA isn’t a government organization, by the way, so I don’t think they can actually enforce anything, but they seem to be in charge of setting industry-wide guidelines and work directly with the government in some capacity. Anyway, the same notice states that ISO 24444:2019 was issued in December 2019. The major changes between the 2010 and 2019 versions are listed in the Foreword of ISO 24444:2019:\n\n>— The definition of the minimal erythema response (MED) criteria has been revised.  \n>\n>— The choice of eligible test subjects is now based solely on individual typology angle (ITA°) with a requirement for the average ITA° for the test panel to be within the range 41° to 55°, with a minimum of three subjects within two of the three ITA° ranges.  \n>\n>— The ITA° is used to define the range of unprotected MED doses for the provisional or the test day unprotected MED determination (if no provisional MEDu determination is made).  \n>\n>— Three new reference standard sunscreens have been validated and added to the method to validate SPF test panels for products with SPF equal to 25 or higher (P5, P6 and P8).  \n>\n>— New test methods are provided to determine the uniformity of the beam of both large and small beam size solar simulators. A requirement for uniformity greater than or equal to 90 % has been added.  \n>\n>— Sunscreen application procedures have been described in greater detail.  \n>\n>— An informative Annex F has been added with photographic examples of erythema responses with guidelines for grading.  \n>\n>— The reporting tables in Annex G) and the requirements in Clause 11 have modified to provide more complete information on the results of the testing.  \n>\n>— The bibliography has been updated.\n\nThe notice from JCIA also lists most of these changes, with a few additional details. They point out for example that the Fitzpatrick skin type is being phased out as criteria for test subjects in favor of individual typology angle (ITA°), which will be relevant later in this post.\n\n*If you have no idea what an “individual typology angle” is (like me), it’s strictly based on skin color and seems much less open to interpretation than the Fitzpatrick skin type criteria. I found* [*this 2013 review article*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/bjd.12529)*^(PDF)* *in the* British Journal of Dermatology *really informative, though I admittedly have only skimmed through it very quickly.*\n\nIt’s possible that Eurofins just hasn’t updated their website, but I think this is what Michelle Ma Chan Mok-lan (Fancl) is talking about in the quote above about the HKCC report using testing methods from 2010. [Fancl Sunguard 50+ Protect UV](https://www.fancl-hk.com/product_details.asp?item_id=5685),^(TC) their product in the report (rated SPF 50+ PA++++ and tested at SPF 14.3 PPD 6.8 or PA++), was apparently released in [2018](https://www.cosme.net/product/product_id/10153767/top)^(J) in Japan, but according to the *South China Morning Post* article, “\\[Ma Chan\\] said that its product went through two rounds of testing by Cantor Research Laboratories in the United States in 2019 and the Chongqing Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital in China in 2017.” (Fancl also seems to point out that their product needs to be shaken before use in [this article](https://beauty.ulifestyle.com.hk/beauty/skincare/20099/fancl防曬-對消委會測試報告表示失望-強調產品完全符合標示-消委會就事件最新回應),^(TC) which could indeed potentially be something that affected the test results. I feel like it’s common knowledge among anyone that’s familiar with milk sunscreens at all, though, and I would hope that any lab conducting these tests would be aware of this. They also seem to say in the same article that any sunscreens that had extremely different test results should be re-tested in more than one lab, which is fair. But keep in mind that I’m reading a machine-translated version of the article for these observations.)\n\nI’m going to ignore the test run in China in 2017 because I believe it would have been following the so-called outdated testing methods, or ISO 24444:2010 (see the section titled “The Chinese version” below). [Cantor Research Laboratories](http://www.cantorlabs.com) basically just has their contact information on the website, so I can’t tell whether they would have conducted their test according to ISO 24444:2019, which would have been possible if the test took place in December. Cantor Research Laboratories was composed of 15 employees and specialized in anti-aging claims [as of 2016](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cen-09419-cover). *(They apparently do testing for Amway, a major MLM company, by the way; try googling* `\"Cantor Research Laboratories\" Amway study`*. —No, I don’t know whether that actally means anything, it’s just something I noticed.)* Eurofins Scientific on the other hand is composed of approximately 50,000 employees in 800 laboratories in 50 countries ([source](https://www.eurofins.com)), though I don’t have numbers for the Australian location specifically. I don’t know whether larger labs would necessarily produce more accurate results, but I would assume they generally wouldn’t be likely to be *less* accurate (or am I completely mistaken?). Interestingly, Dermatest, an Australian lab that was acquired by Eurofins ([source](https://dermatest.com.au)), lists Cantor Research Laboratories among their “Scientific Associates” on [their Links page](https://dermatest.com.au/information/links/). They also cite Cantor Research Laboratories’ Operating Procedure Manual on what appears to be another one of their factsheets, “No. 28 Antiperspirant Efficacy,” published on p. 12 of the February 2017 issue of *The Science of Beauty* (vol. 6 no. 7; [PDF](https://ascc.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SOB-Feb2017.pdf)). On Eurofins’ Australian website, they instruct that samples should be sent to “Eurofins Dermatest,” located at the same address on the Dermatest website ([example](https://www.eurofins.com.au/dermatest/sunscreen-testing/spf-tests-and-related/)), so I’m pretty sure we can think of them as the same entity. Clearly they know of Cantor Research Laboratories, and I wonder what they would say about the discrepancy.\n\nReturning to the *South China Morning Post* article, I assume that “the sampling of Australians for a product designed for Asians” is in reference to SPF testing, not PA testing, since the latter was *in vitro*. According to Eurofins’ [SPF Testing factsheet](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601368/spf-testing.pdf),^(PDF) their test subjects “consisted of fair skin individuals with Fitzpatrick skin types I, II or III” (p. 3). As mentioned above, ISO 24444:2019 no longer uses Fitzpatrick skin types as criteria for test subjects, so I think we can establish that the SPF results in the report cannot be compared directly with any SPF ratings based on ISO 24444:2019. There are however multiple sunscreens that were released before 2020 and would have been based on ISO 24444:2010.\n\nSo referring back to ISO 24444:2010, according to [this PDF from some time before 2013](https://www.tes-h.co.jp/documents/SPFPFA.pdf)^(J)—but I’m not sure whether it’s after 2010—Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, and III were part of the criteria for SPF test subjects (and types II, III, and IV for UVAPF). This would definitely be before 2010, but [this paper](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/sccj1979/26/3/26_3_207/_article/-char/ja/)^(E/J) published by JCIA in 1992 also specifies Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, and III for SPF testing. As discussed below, the same goes for China as of 2015. So it seems like the Eurofins test subjects and test subjects in Japan and China (before ISO 24444:2019) would have the same Fitzpatrick Skin types, but Dr. Dray suggests in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGwjKOHq02w) (“Can we trust sunscreen? Korean SPF controversies,” April 30, 2021) that test subjects in different regions are likely to be skewed toward different skin tones. This is just speculation, but maybe it’s possible that more of the test subjects in Japan and China could have been types II and III, for instance, and more of the test subjects for the HKCC report could have been types I and II. (I’m guessing that this is what Professor Cheung means when he says that “the Eurofins report unfairly ran the tests on an Australian audience \\[…\\] given the products tested by the Consumer Council were formulated for Asian skin.”) In that case, while we absolutely couldn’t say that the ratings for Asian sunscreens are “incorrect” or that the companies are “lying” based on the HKCC report, perhaps the report’s SPF ratings could possibly be pertinent if you have type I skin. But again, this is entirely speculative.\n\n**PA testing:** The Australian Eurofins website seems to confirm that their UVA tests are performed *in vitro*. I’m assuming they follow the [ISO 24443:2012](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24443:ed-1:v1:en)^(E) protocol (*in vitro*), since they have [a factsheet](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601373/iso-24443-in-vitro-uvapf.pdf)^(PDF) for that too, linked from [this page](https://www.eurofins.com.au/dermatest/sunscreen-testing/spf-tests-and-related/uva-tests/) on UVAPF testing. (ISO 24443:2012 is also mentioned at the bottom of [the report’s results table](https://imgur.com/fPhhBUm)^(TC) in footnotes 4 and 5, but I gave up on trying to figure out what it actually says.) In Japan, however, UVAPF testing is performed according to the [ISO 24442:2011](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24442:ed-1:v1:en)^(E) protocol (*in vivo*). Eurofins themselves state in this factsheet that both the Japanese and Korean markets require *in vivo* testing, which they also point out is much more expensive than *in vitro* testing (p. 1). They also state that UVAPF ratings determined by these tests are considered **estimates** of Boots Star, FDA Broad Spectrum,\\* and JCIA UVAPF (= what most of us know as PA) ratings (p. 2).\n\n*\\* The FDA website says in vitro testing is accepted in accordance with* [*21 CFR 201.327(j)*](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=b97fda59bb83d2742a276a215cdc115e&mc=true&node=se21.4.201_1327&rgn=div8)*, which I didn’t have the energy to actually read and am assuming is the same thing as Eurofins’ factsheet on* [*FDA Broad Spectrum Testing*](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601376/fda-broad-spectrum.pdf).*^(PDF)* *They say it’s based on ISO 24443:2012 but with “differing film thickness and pre-irradiation requirements” (p. 1).*\n\nIf the UVAPF testing for the HKCC report was indeed in accordance with ISO 24443:2012, I wouldn’t discredit the results entirely—but again, I’m not an expert. While we can’t say that the ratings for Asian sunscreens are “incorrect” or that the companies are “lying” based on the HKCC report (same as the SPF ratings), it seems to me that the PPD ratings they give in the report could potentially be used to make comparisons with sunscreens from other countries where UVAPF ratings are also determined in accordance with the *in vitro* ISO 24443:2012 protocol, or at least with other results within the same report (though we would still have to keep in mind that “results reported from a single test should not be deemed conclusive”). Eurofins’ own factsheet suggests that ISO 24443:2012 is accepted in Australia, New Zealand, and the EU, but I haven’t done any research to back this up, and we have already seen that their factsheets might be outdated.\n\nThe next versions of [ISO 24442](https://www.iso.org/standard/75496.html)^(E) and [ISO 24443](https://www.iso.org/standard/75059.html)^(E) are about 40% through their respective development processes, by the way, so that’s something to keep an eye on if you’re looking into this stuff.\n\n**EDIT:** u/lovethewayyoulick has posted [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gycvnq4/) about the formulation of Allie sunscreens, specifically regarding Kao/Kanebo’s proprietary “[ADVAN Technology](https://www.kao.com/jp/skincare/surface/surface-02/),\" the name ADVAN coming from “Anti-Damaging uV-A Network.” In a nutshell, their sunscreens are designed to work with sebum to provide higher UVA protection, which would not be reproducible with standard *in vitro* testing. It also seems to explain why Allie sunscreens don't always do too well in casual experiments using light-sensitive materials (as I discuss in the section I had to delete for length posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gyc9sqv/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). I’m now also thinking of other Japanese sunscreens that claim to work with different factors to increase their protection. Shiseido’s [Anessa](http://anessa.shiseido.co.jp/about/) sunscreens, for instance, advertise their “Thermo-Booster Technology” to work with heat and “Aqua-Booster Technology” to work with sweat and water. These product-specific factors may not necessarily be taken into account in third party testing.\n\n**Other possible issues:** Even after looking into all this (without actually reading all the publicly available details in each ISO… sorry, that’s beyond my mental capacity right now), I still don’t know whether the difference between the testing methods would really explain the larger disparities in the SPF results, like the Fancl sunscreen. I’ve seen some of you make a very good point that how old the bottle used for the test is (and I would assume things like storage conditions; last summer was a particularly hot one, and some supplements I ordered from the US arrived practically melted together in the bottle) or even the specific batch could potentially affect test results, too.\n\nFor more information about the actual testing methods, see [\\[Discussion\\]How SPF and PA are measured in Japan](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mqysux/discussionhow_spf_and_pa_are_measured_in_japan/) by u/ysy_heart. (I want to note that the SPF testing methods described here are based on ISO 24444:2010 and have technically been phased out, but it seems general enough to be at least mostly applicable for ISO 24444:2019, too.)\n\n*—Phew, that was long! I keep seeing this report being mentioned, so I wanted to try my best to do my due diligence. I don’t have a background in science, though, and it’s my first time even actually looking at ISOs, so I’m sorry if I’m completely off.*\n\n# National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan (May 2020)\n\nIn another [report by the National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mx54m7/discussionthirdparty_testing_on_27_japanese/)^(E) published in May 2020, either the 2018 formula or the 2020 formula of the Allie gel (unclear) was confirmed to be SPF 50+ PA++++ in two out of two tests using a spectrophotometer, though I’m honestly skeptical of the general accuracy of these tests, seeing how four sunscreens claiming to be SPF 30–35 tested consistently at SPF 50+. I guess Japanese companies *could* plausibly be motivated to label their products with lower ratings than what they actually are, since many consumers here believe that high-SPF products are rough on your skin and can actively seek lower-SPF products for daily use, but as an amateur, it seems like it would be easier to actually make a low-SPF product if that’s what you want to sell.\n\nAgain, these tests were performed with an *entirely* different method, and I imagine their results can only be used to draw comparisons with other results in this same report, if anything at all. (For more information on the testing method, see u/ysy_heart’s research and thoughts in the link for the report.)  If there’s so much hubbub about the testing methods in the HKCC report, I’m sure testing with a spectrophotometer would be even further off. I want to give the NCACJ credit for at least running each test twice instead of just doing it once and being done with it, but I also don’t know whether running the spectrophotometer tests even a hundred times would necessarily be credible.\n\nAlso, although the HKCC report seems to have product name errors too (I’ll cut them some slack because they’re dealing with products from other countries, and the photo helps with product identification), I can definitively say that the report the NCACJ published has [some mistakes and ambiguities](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mx54m7/discussionthirdparty_testing_on_27_japanese/gvsj5eh).^(E) This doesn’t necessarily mean that the tests themselves are equally faulty, but it does make me wary of any other potential mistakes in printing the test results.\n\n# The Chinese version\n\nThe Allie gel is also rated SPF 50+ PA++++ [in China](https://allie.cn)^(SC) (and SPF 45 PA++++ after being immersed in water according to [their official TMall page](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?spm=a212k0.12153887.0.0.1a67687dAgrr3k&id=596686898582),^(SC) if I’m interpreting “浴后防晒指数” correctly), where they require testing at National Medical Product Administration (NMPA) accredited labs in China, as well as additional *in vivo* testing ([source](https://www.cosmeticsdesign-asia.com/Article/2019/08/19/Sunscreen-regulations-in-the-world-from-European-Union-USA-Canada-to-China)^(E)). The NMPA-approved testing methods seem to be detailed in [this 11 MB PDF](https://www.nmpa.gov.cn/directory/web/nmpa/images/MjAxNcTqtdoyNji6xbmruOa4vbz+LnBkZg==.pdf)^(SC) of their Safety and Technical Standards for Cosmetics (2015), SPF testing from p. 546 and PA or PFA testing from p. 554. I’ve given up on trying to decipher everything, but it appears that their SPF testing either follows or is based on ISO 24444:2010 (so it might have been updated by now), using test subjects with Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, and III, and their PA testing either follows or is based on ISO 24442:2011, using test subjects with Fitzpatrick skin types III and IV.\n\nInitially I was satisfied in thinking of this as another separate test performed on the Allie gel, but then it occurred to me that I don’t know whether the Chinese version has the same formulation as the Japanese version or not, though I assume they would at least be very similar. [Based on the packaging](https://imgur.com/a/WbH2gAS),^(E) I’m guessing that the current version there is basically equivalent to Allie Extra UV Gel (the 2018 formula in Japan). [This page](https://www.jeebei.com/pingce/hufupin/ql1z6.html) lists the ingredients as follows:\n\n> 水，乙醇，氧化锌，三乙氧基辛基硅烷，甲氧基肉桂酸乙基己酯，丁羟甲苯，甘油三（乙基己酸）酯，异壬酸异壬酯，丙烯酸钠/丙烯酰二甲基牛磺酸钠共聚物，异十六烷，聚山梨醇酯-80，丁二醇，甘油，双-乙基己氧苯酚甲氧苯基三嗪，乙基己基三嗪酮，聚二甲基硅氧烷，黄原胶，EDTA 二钠，水解胶原，苯氧乙醇，透明质酸钠\n\nThis translates to:\n\n> Water, Ethanol, Zinc Oxide, Trimethoxycaprylylsilane, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, BHT, Triethylhexanoin, Isononyl Isononanoate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Polysorbate 80, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\nThis is the ingredient list for the Japanese 2018 formula, according to the packaging of a tube I bought in a major drugstore in Japan:\n\n> Water, Zinc Oxide, Ethanol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Triethylhexanoin, Isononyl Isononanoate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Isohexadecane, Polysorbate 80, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, BHT, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Collagen\n\n*Both are my own translations and I don’t have a background in chemistry. Also, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate = Octinoxate, Ethylhexyl Triazone = Uvinul T 150, and Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine = Tinosorb S.*\n\nObviously, the order of the ingredients differ, but I don’t know whether China has the same rules about the order of the ingredients or not. One definitively different point, though, is that the Chinese version contains Phenoxyethanol and the Japanese version doesn’t. So while I can’t say how different or similar the two versions might be, it’s clear that they aren’t exactly the same.\n\nIt’s been pointed out that the [Bioré UV Athlizm essence](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/biore-uv-athlizm-skin-protect-essence/)^(E) and the [Bioré UV Aqua Rich gel](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/biore-uv-aqua-rich-watery-gel-2019/)^(E) and [essence](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/biore-uv-aqua-rich-watery-essence-2019/)^(E) are all rated SPF 50+ PA+++ [in China](https://www.kao.com/cn/products/biore/),^(SC) and not SPF 50+ PA++++ as they are rated in Japan, but since they are sold ~~(and possibly manufactured)~~ locally by Kao (China) Holding Co., Ltd. rather than as import products from Japan, you would have to consider the possibility that they may not necessarily have the same formulation as the Japanese equivalents.\n\n**EDIT:** I’ve just figured out that the Chinese versions of the Allie gel and Bioré UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence are made in Japan with different formulations specifically for the Chinese market. See links re: each product [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gyhq3fu).\n\nSimilarly, RatzillaCosme says in a comment on [this page](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/skin-aqua-uv-super-moisture-gel-spf50-4-plus/) that “Rohto products that are marketed for outside of Japan have different ingredients/formulas than Japan’s and they’re not Japan-made (despite the Japanese printed). If the Japanese version is what you want, both the packaging and product name need to be exactly the same as what \\[is\\] shown in my site.” They also say in a comment [here](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/skin-aqua-uv-super-moisture-essence-2020/) in response to an inquiry about [Sunplay Skin Aqua](http://www.mentholatum.com.cn/home/products/skincare/sunplay/index.shtml) Watery Essence SPF 50+ PA++++ (I’m not sure but possibly [this](http://www.mentholatum.com.cn/home/products/skincare/sunplay/detail-75.shtml)^(SC)), “That product isn’t Japanese — it’s made in China by a different company. It isn’t produced by Rohto Pharmaceutical in Japan.” (Credit goes to someone on this sub for mentioning that Ratzilla talks about this in their comments section. I’m sorry I can’t remember who it was.) Going back to the HKCC report, the results table says that [Sunplay Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Gel](http://www.mentholatum.com.cn/home/products/skincare/sunplay/detail-72.shtml)^(SC) is manufactured in China (in addition to the “Sunplay” in the product name already being a giveaway; in Japan, [Mentholatum Sunplay](https://jp.rohto.com/uv-sunplay/) is a separate Rohto brand alongside Skin Aqua, so “Sunplay Skin Aqua” doesn’t exist), so the results in the report would not necessarily be applicable for the Japanese product, not to mention the other concerns I discussed.\n\nSo the situation arises where there are products that aren’t “fake” but also aren’t exactly the same thing as what’s sold in Japan, kind of like how the American versions of LRP sunscreens wouldn't contain their more advanced filters (which is probably more drastic of a difference than what I’m discussing here). This might be especially important for anyone buying the product from non-Japanese vendors. Double check to make sure you’re getting the version you intended to buy—and if you specifically wanted the non-Japanese version, that’s great too. Like [the American and Japanese Curél Intensive Moisture Creams](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/labr3m/difference_between_japanese_and_american_version/), it’s possible that the end result (the user experience) is pretty much the same anyway, but in the case of sunscreen, make sure you know what the SPF/PA rating is for the exact version you’re buying.\n\n# Using sunscreens from major corporations\n\nIn [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNsoPyo1PjA)^(J) posted on March 26, 2020, skinfluencer Arata Tomori says that SPF testing is usually outsourced to a third party lab, and that PA testing is often performed in-house (I haven’t looked into this). She says that different labs can come up with different results, and based on her own past experience with trying to make a sunscreen (I think she has her own skincare line), she has heard of labs that are actually known to give higher SPF ratings. She recommends that we stick with major corporations that are more likely to be working with labs that would provide accurate results.\n\nIn [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTS0Xd-T97s)^(J) posted on March 28, 2020, cosmetic chemist YouTuber Sumisho discusses issues with SPF ratings in general, with the AMA Laboratories case in the US as an example. He says we should be careful with smaller brands, and advises that it’s a good idea to pick products that are made by major corporations that put a lot into sunscreen R&D. He also advises that products sold in China go through additional testing and could be more reliable, and that you could check Tmall for listings, but I want to add again that you would need to make sure you’re looking at the version you want.\n\nOdile Monod also breaks down the difference between OBM, OEM, and ODM products in [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC8r3S0i0Ro) I mentioned earlier. Although she’s talking about the Korean beauty industry, I think this part probably applies for other countries, too, and she advises that it’s (not necessarily foolproof but) a good idea to pick OBM products that are formulated and manufactured in-house.\n\nAnd now [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/n8afq7/discussiondirector_of_japan_cosmetic_industry/) about the response u/ysy_heart got from the JCIA director can be interpreted to back up this approach as well. I’m generally in favor of indie brands in spirit, and usually I would think more about how these people might be benefiting from making these claims, but I do see how major corporations would have a lot more to lose from these sunscreen scandals. I also don’t think I’ve seen companies like Amorepacific (for instance) mentioned in connection with the recent scandal in Korea.\n\nI’m still looking up different sunscreens and who actually manufactures them, but the Kao Group (including Kanebo), the Kosé Group, the Pola Orbis Group, the Rohto Group, and the Shiseido Group are some major Japanese corporations that seem to generally have OBM products. I have a huge spreadsheet in progress that I plan on sharing whenever I think it’s ready, with specific products from these companies (and others) and some properties I wanted to compare.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nIf you’re *really* concerned about the accuracy of SPF/PA ratings, I guess the truly thorough approach would be to look at as many tests as possible. You could either stick with the sunscreens that consistently do well in third party testing (guilty until proven innocent) or avoid those that consistently do poorly (innocent until proven guilty).\n\nThe problem with this approach is that it just isn’t realistic, especially considering how frequently Japanese sunscreens are reformulated. A test result from last year might not be applicable for a product that was reformulated this year. You would have to make sure where the product tested was manufactured and what year it was released, and then there are the potential issues with storage conditions and different batches, etc. Also, “real” testing is expensive, and it’s not all that likely that there would be multiple credible third party tests following official protocols performed on the same formulation.\n\nAs Professor Tong says in the *South China Morning Post* article, we should probably accept that no single test is going to be an absolutely definitive one. Personally, with regard to what I’m already using, if it’s keeping my sun allergy symptoms from showing up, that’s good enough for me—but I guess you could say that I have the advantage (?) of my face being a hypersensitive UV meter of sorts. As for any products I might try in the future, I’m going to keep trusting the ratings as they are claimed unless there’s a scandal specifically involving that product. We *are* already taking a kind of leap of faith in trusting that the product is otherwise safe to use and that the ingredient list is correct and so on. And regardless of any tests results, even good ones, I would make sure to apply plenty, to reapply, and to avoid relying on sunscreen alone, especially if I’m going to be outside for an extended amount of time.",

I’ve been living in Japan for over 10 years, and am under the impression that the general consensus among Japanese consumers is that you use either Anessa or Allie if you don’t want to tan/burn, Anessa being top-level protection and Allie coming in second while also being easier on your skin. (This seems to specifically be based on Anessa’s [flagship milk](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/anessa-perfect-uv-sunscreen-skincare-milk-a-2020/)^(E) and Allie’s gel products, even though Anessa also has gels and Allie also has a milk.)\n\nThis doesn’t necessarily mean they’re absolutely the best sunscreens in the entire Japanese market, of course—the products discussed on this sub represent just a small fraction of all the sunscreens available in Japan—nor do I know how they would really compare with European sunscreens (which I’ve never used, aside from a couple of Asia/Australia-specific LRP products), but it does suggest that they must at least be among the best that are commonly available in drugstores nationwide.\n\nAllie sunscreens seem to do well in those completely unscientific experiment memes where people apply a ton of different sunscreens on their backs and lay out in the sun:\n\n|**Video/Article**|**Sunscreens and UV source**|**Conclusion**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Sunameri for Kakaku.com, [人気の日焼け止め10種を徹底比較！ 日サロで肌を焼いて効果を確かめてみた](https://kakakumag.com/houseware/?id=11834), January 14, 2019|10 sunscreens including Allie Extra UV Gel (2018 formula);

Granted, I was wearing sunglasses, a hat, and occasionally a sun umbrella but I think that proves your final thoughts - apply plenty and reapply, reapply, reapply!",

I personally would go for the Be Plain when it's available because it has a simplified formula without the unnecessary plant extracts and flower oils. I think the Be Plain one would be better for oily skin than the Round Lab one. Both of the Hyggee sunscreens look promising, but I'm gravitating towards the Vegan Sun Cream because it is a chemical sunscreen and I have a tan complexion, I don't want to risk a white cast. However, the Real Sun Cream does have an interesting ingredient list and whipped texture (as I can see on Yesstyle)  and I will be looking out for reviews to see whether it leaves a white cast or not and make my decision accordingly. What I love about the Hyggee sunscreens is that they are fragrance/essential oil free, but they still contain alcohol. I prefer alcohol because it allows the sunscreen to set better and be less tacky. If you have oily skin, I would think that one of the Hyggee sunscreens would work better for you because I have a Kolmar sunscreen (Isntree Watery Sun Gel) that is similar to the new Round Lab and Be Plain sunscreens and I definitely wouldn't recommend it for oily skin as it is way too shiny.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that the Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream has beet root extract, which made me think of the Krave Beet Shield. Get this, the Beet Shield was also made in Cosmax, same as this new Hyggee one. So I did some digging and found out that the Beet Shield has the SAME exact 5 filters as this new Hyggee sunscreens in the same order. The rest of ingredients are not too similar though, so I do not think they are the same exact sunscreen, as opposed to how I feel about the Be Plain and Round Lab sunscreens, which I do think are almost identical. I do think this Vegan Sun Cream is inspired by the Beet Shield, with maybe an improved formula, since the Beet Shield did not pass SPF tests. So if you are looking for a replacement of the Krave Beauty Beet Shield but with verified SPF protection, get the new Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream!",

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

No white cast whatsoever :)|Has a significant sheen. Doesn't like to \"sink in\" on the face; remains spreadable and moves around. Doesn't rub in evenly; leaves white streaks on the face that are literally impossible to 100% blend out (also [these tiny white specks](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ff5f815faede7ce5649a190212000a4a/tumblr_pnuvm7CC2x1vnh3sio1_540.jpg)).

Sometimes the shine is unevenly distributed/there are patches that are less shiny, not sure what's up with that. Overall the shine is bearable; some days I don't powder it and it looks fine. Shine leans more dewy than oily. Despite the shine this is neither moisturizing nor drying.|Still has a white cast (though it fades very slightly) and looks shinier than the shaka. On the face it looks quite ridiculous and I always find the need to powder over it to hide the cast and shine. The shine is not \"dewy\", it's definitely oily. I would not say this is wearable for any skin tones darker than NC30 without a colored foundation/powder on top. Despite the shine this is neither moisturizing nor drying. |\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After 15 minutes, with flash.

In both cases I was sufficiently protected; no burns or tans, no deepening of PIH (and I tan/get PIH very easily -- most US and Asian formulations aren't protective enough for me). For me this works just as well as the old formulation, if not better.\n\n\\--\n\nOverall, I was pleasantly surprised by this reformulation. Not only is it more cosmetically elegant in terms of both shine and white cast, but it has a slightly higher PPD and doesn't contain octocrylene, which was one of the ingredients I didn't quite like in the old formula. \n\nI will continue to purchase this sunscreen and look forward to seeing how it holds up in higher (summer) UV indices.",

    "body": "Hiya,\n\nI hope you enjoy the below reviews. I'm just a regular consumer buying everything with my own money - i.e., nothing sponsored, etc. Note, I've bought all of them on sale for around AUD$15-20 because I like sales haha.\n\nProducts:\n\n1. PKY - essence toner;\n2. PKY - mist toner;\n3. Secret Key - fresh nature toner - milk brightening one;\n4. Benton - Aloe BHA Toner;\n5. Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner; and\n6. Purito - Centella Green Level Calming Toner & the unscented version (Purito Unscented Centella Toner)\n\nMy skin used to be severely dry but is now slightly dry on the cheek areas and slightly oily on the t-zone during summer and slightly dry on the whole face in the winter.\n\nAlso note that the below two PKY products have different 'actives'/hero ingredients notwithstanding them seemingly being quite similar! I've bolded the plant extracts under the ingredient headers below.\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Essence Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495), *Australian* websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. *Note, this one is generally recommended for people with drier skin whereas the mist version is generally recommended for those with oilier skin* Friends with eczema have also used this with success. *.* I can use both year round without breaking out. I've had friends with oilier skin who've used this one and have broken out. YMMV.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** LOVE THIS. May repurchase this for the rest of my life. I've used this after breaking my moisture barrier, after chemical peels, after active masks, and also *after getting my face ablatively lasered (after the the initial few days of only using an ointment)*. It's REALLY benign in a godly way. If you want it to do anything other than hydrate or increase the penetration of your other actives, this isn't the product for you (note, it doesn't claim to do anything else apart from hydrate & calm really).\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a little bit thicker than water but not as thick as the Purito centella toners. Won't run off your hand/face like water will but will eventually run off.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** None at allll, even when I broke my moisture barrier.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? Yes**/I have rebought this 4 or so times so far.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Mist Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance. This is in a spray bottle and is better suited to oily skinned persons.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1060395517?cpid=1060395516&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1060395517%3Fcpid%3D1060395516%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=876677637398885328), and Australian websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/pyunkang-mist-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. This one is more for people with slightly oilier skin too. It's a lighter formula than the essence one.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Decent hydration, I prefer to use this in the toner stage instead of after my skincare but I have enjoyed using it as a 'refreshing' spray during the day.\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a nice mist, doesn't run on the face. Feels like a spray of water?\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a spray bit on top. I've had no issues with it but one mate had a couple that didn't spray properly.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** Unsure. I've rebought it once but haven't gone to use this one as much as I have the PKY essence toner or the Purito Unscented Centella Toner. I also don't like mists a whole bunch as they can go onto your clothes (if you're out) or jewellery if you're wearing any. But, I did go through a phase of keeping it in my handbag and using it when out and about for a bit of hydration.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Coptis Japonica Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Secret Key - Fresh nature Toner (Milk Brightening)**\n\n**What is it:** Hydrating toner that's meant to brighten your skin.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx.

Couldn't use it long enough to notice anything.\n\n**Smell:** A very strong scent that I could barely use it. I think I used it around 5-10 times before binning it - I couldn't even put up with the scent of this to use it on other parts of my body.\n\n**Feel:** really watery.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Fortunately (given the high fragrance), no reactions to this. If you had any irritation though, I'd expect some sort of reaction.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? No**, given I threw mine out.\n\n**Ingredients:** Not a comprehensive list given there's a generic list on yesstyle then a list below it for the main ones in the milk one but here -\n\n700ppm) \\[**sic**\\], 1, 2-Hexandiol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata Extract, Nonoxynol-12, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Tremella Fuciformis Extract, Allantoin, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Cucumber Extract, Propylene Glycol, Tomato Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Rice Extract, Lanoline, Tea Tree Leaf Water (9, Sciadopitys Verticillata Root Extract, Pumpkin Extract, Papaya Fruit Extract, Oleth-10, Viola Tricolor Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Ethanol, Glyceryl Stearate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Chamomilia Recutita Flower Extract, Morus Alba Bark Extract, Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Lemon Extract, Oleth-5, Sodium Hyaluronate, Potato Extract, Pomegranate Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Sap Extract, Bean Extract, Aloe Vera Leaf Water (9, Broccoli Extract, Glycerin, Green Tea Extract, Plantago Asiatica Extract, Hollyhock Root Extract, Witch Hazel Extract (9, Phenoxyethanol, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Mineral Oil, Ulmus Campestris Extract, Carrot Extract, Polysorbate 80, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rose Damascena Flower Water (9, Korean Raspberry Extract, Milk Protein Extract (9, White Willow Bark Extract, Psidium Guajava Fruit Extract, Witch Hazel Extract, 4-Terpineol, Algae Extract\n\nand then it says the main ones in the milk version are -\n\ngalactomyces ferment filtrate, pomegranate extract, physalis alkenkengi extract, milk protein concentrate, raspberry extract, pasque flower extract, potato extract, carrot extract, pumpkin extract, rice extract, usnea extract, broccoli extract\n\nso who really knows what's in it...\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Benton Aloe BHA Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating toner which is meant to gently exfoliate with 0.5% salicylic acid.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$23. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/benton-aloe-bha-skin-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1053033537), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** people with sensitive and dry skin as it's quite rich.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** on and off since mid 2020, still using it randomly to just use it up.\n\n**My thoughts:** Per Google (may not be accurate), it has a pH of 5.5 which is too high for there to be any noticeable exfoliation with 0.5% BHA present. I've not noticed any calming effects. It is definitely hydrating but given it's advertised as a BHA toner I'm quite disappointed at the lack of BHA efficacy here. I would much rather use the purito centella toner to hydrate and calm my skin as the centella has other benefits such as helping to stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** Similar to the PKY essence toner. Not as thick as the purito centella toners.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a pump on top. No issues with it, but it can come out a bit forcefully sometimes.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **No**, almost threw it out but am trying to use it up.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nAloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Water (80%), Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Beta-Glucan, Polyglutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea (Green Purslane) Extract, Psidium Guajava (Guava) Fruit Extract, Salicylic Acid (0.5%), Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract (200mg), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice (200mg), Arginine, Pentylene Glycol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Polysorbate 20, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** **Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 relief toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$25 for 180mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/etude-house-soon-jung-ph-5-5-relief-toner-180ml-180ml/info.html/pid.1058586258), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone. It adds light hydration with benign ingredients - akin to the PKY toners but very minimally more expensive. It'd be good if you have irritated and/or dry skin.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** I used it once/twice a day until I used it up. Bought it in December 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Pretty decent. I'd recommend this to the same group of people who'd use the PKY essence toner. Nothing ground breaking. I prefer the calming nature of the Purito Unscented Centella Toner or even the PKY essence toner if you want zero actives (if you consider centella an 'active').\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** A watery toner.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** No but for no fault of the product. I just prefer using the Purito Unscented Centella one as it's just as benign, a bit cheaper, and has the benefits of centella.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, Propanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Madecassoside, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Polyglycerin-3, Disodium EDTA\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**Centella Green Level Calming Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804) **& the** [**Centella Unscented Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380)\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating and calming toner - may also stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$30 but I've always bought it on sale for approx. AUD$20-25 for 200mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380), [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml)\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone however this is best suited to those with any sort of irritation, acne, or redness. That is, if you have basically perfect skin you're probably not going to notice much of a difference but if you have irritation etc then you'll likely fall in love. Also good if you're wanting to help stimulate collagen production especially for the low price point - target ages for this is probably mid twenties and up.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** religiously since April 2020, sometimes twice a day.\n\n**My thoughts:** *BLOODY EXCELLENT*. I'm on my second bottle of this. My first bottle was the first listed one (scented) and then they released the unscented one so I bought that! It's incredible. I love it. In my opinion, it's partially why my skin is able to tolerate me using actives so much. It's excellent to use before actives as it doesn't interact with anything and really good to use after an 'active' mask or a clay mask etc. I switched to the unscented one to just reduce the risk of irritation.\n\n*also studies, which I haven't read but have seen derms I trust on insta etc, say that* ***centella can help stimulate/produce collagen... a big yes from me given it's a calming ingredient that shouldn't purge you or break you out*** *(unless you're allergic/sensitive to it)!*\n\n**Smell:** The scented one smells herbaceous (akin to Asian herbal medicine - I don't mind it but others may). The unscented one doesn't really smell like anything / I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** thick/fat/heavy water. Not a watery toner. Enjoyable.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Neverrrrrr, this helps me reduce the side effects from using actives such as retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, etc.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **Yes** & I have. Will probably rebuy for life.\n\n**Ingredients:** 4 variants as they've got the scented and unscented versions, and then those with and without witch hazel\n\nnon-witch hazel unscented version -\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract (strengthens skin barrier), Butylene Glycol (humectants), Pentylene Glycol (skin-conditioning agents), Dipropylene Glycol (humectants), 1,2-Hexanediol (stabilizers), Trehalose (humectants), Sodium Hyaluronate (natural moisturizing factor/ humectants), Hamemelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiaticoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiatic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Madecassic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Panthenol (strengthens skin barrier), Carbomer (viscosity increasing agents), Allantoin (skin protectants), Arginine (skin-conditioning agents), Portulaca Oleracea Extract (skin-conditioning agents), Ethylhexylglycerin (skin-conditioning agents), Disodium EDTA (stabilizers)\n\nI hope these reviews were useful :)",

A lot of skincare is based on “it *should * work” theoretically, but unless it’s tested with real outside factors (not done only in a lab) like does it penetrate the skin, does it work on skin pH, does it work with other products, and many other factors, I wouldn’t trust claims like increasing collagen production. I would only trust claims I can see after using a product. \n\n\nAs far as I know, topical creams cannot generate collagen production. Collagen is created from the foods you eat. I’m not even sure you can take collagen supplements to increase collagen production because everything in your body is broken down in the same way and your body will direct the amino acids to where the body needs it most and not where you might want it.",

    "body": "Background to this text post: \n\nI had made two replies -- [here is the first comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ugucv/spending_that_much_on_moisturizer_is_stupid_i/cei011t) and [this is my second comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ugucv/spending_that_much_on_moisturizer_is_stupid_i/ceihi8p) -- to two comments that a person made on a post in this subreddit.  Doing that research inspired me to make this post.\n\nFirstly, Lancome is owned by L'oreal.  An example of research that L'oreal has done is with stem cells and [the first L'oreal brand product that benefited from that is Lancome's Absolue Precious Cells](http://www.loreal.com/research-innovation/push-back-the-boundaries-of-knowledge/the-revelation-of-stem-cells.aspx).  In fact, [Lancome is a L'oreal Luxe brand](http://www.loreal.com/Brands.aspx?topcode=CorpTopic_Brand).  \n\nThere is no guarantee that the L'oreal products work exactly the same as the Lancome products, as there tends to be less of the specialized ingredients in the L'oreal products and that there tends to be some variation of other ingredients in the products.  An example of this is that in Lancome's Vissionaire serum, there is [4% of the LR2412 molecule](http://www.lancome-usa.com/Visionnaire/1000680,default,pd.html?start=1&q=visionnaire&cgid=skincare_visionnaire&cm_vc=search) while L'oreal's Youth Code Texture Perfector Serum Concentrate has [2% of the LR2412 molecule](http://www.lorealparisusa.com/en/Products/Skin-Care/Treatments/Youth-Code-Texture-Perfector-Serum-Concentrate.aspx).  So here is the list I have compiled up:\n\n**Eye Products:**\n\n* Absolue Eye Premium Bx is similar to L’oreal’s Age Perfect Eye Cream\n* Rénergie is similar to L’oreal’s Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Golden Balm Eye\n* High Résolution Eye Refill - 3X is similar to L’oreal’s RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream\n\n\n**Treatments and Serums:**\n\n* Vissionaire is similar to L’oreal’s Youth Code Texture Perfector\n* Génefique Cream Serum (as serum) is similar to L’oreal’s Youth Code Serum Intense\n* Génefique Eye Light-Pearl is similar to L’oreal’s Youth Code Youth Regenerating Skincare Eye Cream\n\n**Moisturizers:**\n\n* Bienfait Aqua Vital Cream, Bienfait Aqua Vital Lotion, & Bienfait Multi-Vital Night is similar to L’oreal’s Ideal Moisture Even Skin Tone All Skin Types Day/Night Cream\n* High Résolution Refill - 3X is similar to L’oreal’s RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Face & Neck Contour Cream\n* Nutrix Royal & Nutrix is similar to L’oreal’s Hydra-Renewal Continuous Moisture Cream\n* Rénergie Cream is similar to L’oreal’s Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Golden Balm Face, Neck & Chest\n* Rénergie Lift Multi-Action Night Cream & High Résolution Night Refill - 3X are similar to L’oreal’s RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle & Firming Night Cream\n* Génefique Repair Youth Activating Night Cream & Génefique Cream Serum (as moisturizer) is similar to L’oreal’s Youth Code Youth Regenerating Skincare Day/Night Cream\n\n**Makeup Removers/Cleanser:**\n\n* Effacil is similar to L’oreal’s Clean Artiste 100% Oil-Free Eye Makeup Remover\n* Bifacil is similar to L’oreal’s Clean Artiste Waterproof & Long Wearing Eye Makeup Remover\n* Absolue Premium BX is similar to L’oreal’s RevitaLift Radiant Smoothing Cream Cleanser\n* Lancome Eau Micellaire Douceur is similar to Skin Perfection 3 in 1 Purifying Micellar Solution (available in some non-U.S. markets).\n    * Lancome Eau Micellaire Douceur\n        \n        **aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Poloxamer 184,** Dihydrocholeth-30, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Benzyl Salicylate, Propylene Glycol, **Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Disodium EDTA,** Rosa Gallica Extract, Parfum.\n\n   * L'oreal Paris Skin Perfection 3 in 1 Purifying Micellar Solution\n\n        **aqua, hexylene glycol, glycerin, poloxamer 184, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, disodium EDTA,** polyaminopropyl biguanide.\n\n\nFor my sources to figure out L'oreal products that are similar to Lancome products, I use ingredient lists and product descriptions on L'oreal's website as well as Lancome's website.  If I could not find an ingredient list on either of those websites, I used Cosdna.  \n\nI hope this list was/is able to help some of you awesome people out.\n\nEDIT 1: added another product to the Makeup Removers/Cleanser section that nihilcupio gave in the comments.

An X-ray revealed numerous radio-dense, oblong, irregular bodies in both kidneys, the largest of which measured 10 mm x 8 mm x 6 mm. The patient was diagnosed with kidney stones. As the largest stone was impacted in the wall of the renal calyx and had likely caused a perforation, it was decided to remove it laparoscopically. The surgery revealed a large and mostly smooth stone, dark brownish-black in color. It was removed without incident and sent to the lab for examination. The perforation in the calyx was sutured.\n\nThere were no postoperative complications. However, the patient began complaining of malaise, muscle pain, and severe joint pain. She was running a fever of 101 F. She was empirically started on ceftriaxone for possible urinary tract or kidney infection.\n\nOn Day 2, she asked to speak with the physician in charge of her case (the author). She admitted to having undergone gene therapy at an unlicensed clinic. She had a family history of motor neuron disease of the ALS type which had affected her mother, one of her mother's two sisters, her maternal grandmother, and all of her maternal grandmother's three sisters. Symptoms generally began between ages 55 and 60, and included weakness and loss of coordination (starting in the legs and progressing upwards), painful spasticity, and eventually, global muscle wasting. Victims of the disease were ventilator-dependent by approximately 3 years after onset. The patient, her mother, and her aunt had all undergone genetic testing, which revealed a homozygous SOD1 mutation at position 113 (isoleucine to methionine). The mother committed suicide at age 59, after the onset of upper-limb symptoms. The aunt began showing symptoms at age 51 and died at age 55. The patient had the same mutation as both her mother and her aunt, and had written several magazine articles about living with the threat of a debilitating genetic disease.\n\nShe said that, as a result of these articles, she had been contacted by an unknown woman who said she ran a private gene therapy clinic. The woman would not identify herself, saying that she was not a licensed physician, and that she faced criminal charges if her clinic was discovered. However, she claimed an intimate knowledge of both genetic disease and gene therapy, and presented credentials to that effect. She invited the patient to visit her facility. \n\nDuring her visit, the woman showed the patient several rooms containing people with neuromuscular disorders. She was also introduced to a man in his 50s who claimed the woman had cured him of his ALS. She spoke to the man, and saw videos and documents regarding his treatment, and was convinced of the efficacy of the treatment. Over the course of three weeks, she underwent six injections of what the woman described as “enzyme-bound DNA.” She suffered from flulike symptoms for approximately one week after the treatment, but when she was re-tested, her body load of 113(I→M)-SOD1 had dropped from 100% to 3%, which she considered curative. She paid the woman a large sum of money (she refused to disclose the exact amount). Three weeks later, she developed the kidney pain and hematuria.\n\nRapid PCR showed evidence of infection with Varicella zoster. The patient confirmed that she had been infected with chickenpox as a child. She said she didn't believe the gene therapy had involved the use of live viruses.\n\nBy the end of Day 2, the lab had had an opportunity to examine the kidney stone in detail. Although it appeared on inspection to be a pure calcium oxalate stone, the calcium oxalate comprised only a thin layer on the stone's surface. The interior consisted of an extremely tough and somewhat malleable substance which was silvery, iridescent, and extremely opaque to X-rays. Mass spectrometry only showed evidence of ordinary biomolecules (primarily calcium oxalate, water, and uric acid). Because of concerns about a possible metal-accumulation disorder, the stone was subjected to further testing. X-ray diffraction showed an amorphous solid. It was theorized, in view of the patient's family history of genetic disease, that the material was some sort of refractory ceramic, coincidentally excreted as a result of metabolic disease. A comprehensive metabolic study was initiated.\n\nOn Day 5, the patient complained that the joint pains had become unbearable. She was started on low-dose morphine. X-rays of her right knee, left elbow, and right shoulder showed severe inflammatory arthritis with numerous small (< 2 mm) X-ray opaque bodies in the synovial spaces. Arthrocentesis revealed cloudy, leukocyte-rich synovial fluid containing numerous small round objects which were black and irregular. Washing with sodium hydroxide and sonication with detergents removed the black coating, revealing a silvery, iridescent material identical to that of the stone recovered from the kidney.\n\nBecause of concerns about metal toxicity, the patient was empirically started on chelation therapy with calcium disodium EDTA and penicillimine along with IV mineral replacement.\n\nIn order to assess the distributions of the patient's metal deposits, an MRI was considered. However, because of concerns that the deposits might be ferromagnetic, the patient was subjected to a pre-MRI metal scan, which she passed, albeit with a small margin of safety. Because of her worsening pain, she elected to go ahead with the MRI. However, when the field in the scanner reached 0.13 Tesla, the patient complained of a burning sensation in her body and extreme exacerbation of the joint pain. The scan was stopped immediately. Following the MRI, her arthritis and fever worsened, and she was listed as ineligible for future MRIs.\n\nOn Day 7, when her fever and pain had improved, a CT scan was performed. This revealed mild edema in almost all joints and severe edema in the joints of the lower extremities below the level of the knee. There were erosive plaques in both femurs. There were small X-ray-dense bodies in nearly all soft tissues (all measuring less than 1 mm). In addition, there were several large objects ( > 1 mm) in the kidneys, the peritoneum, and the liver. These objects caused significant starburst artifacts, making the CT scan difficult to interpret.\n\nAs the largest of these objects were concentrated in the liver (there were 35 objects between 1 mm and 5 mm), a liver biopsy was performed and six of them removed from the left lobe. They were coated with bile salts and clotted blood. Two were flash-frozen and stored. Two were sent to the hospital's lab, one untreated and one cleaned as described above. One treated object and one untreated object were also sent to the local university for examination by their departments of chemistry and physics.\n\nOn Day 9, the patient suddenly began complaining of chest pain and shortness of breath. Her ECG showed Q waves in V1 and V2. An echocardiogram revealed a perforated tricuspid valve with significant regurgitation and a possible flail leaflet. The patient developed mild ST-segment depression and runs of atrial tachycardia. Repeat echocardiogram showed worsening of tricuspid regurgitation, sluggishness of the right atrium, and hypokinesis of the basal and septal regions of the right ventricle.\n\nThe patient's cardiac function worsened significantly in spite of inotropic support. She was sent to the OR for emergent valve repair. The repair was conducted by our chief of cardiothoracic surgery and involved a trans-atrial approach with cardiopulmonary bypass but without cardioplegic arrest. The right leaflet was found to be perforated in its center and torn at its junction with the annulus, with significant thrombosis and stiffness of both the affected and unaffected leaflets. Because of thrombosis and inflammation, all leaflets were excised. A small spheroidal object was recovered from the right ventricle and was found to be identical to the previous deposits. A prosthetic tissue valve was implanted and the surgery completed.\n\nThe patient recovered well from the surgery, and was transferred out of the cardiac ICU on Day 16. However, she complained of increasing pain in her groin, kidneys, legs, abdomen, back, and chest. X-rays showed several new deposits scattered throughout the pelvis and abdomen, and embedded in the walls of the large veins of the legs, the inferior vena cava, and the aorta. It was the opinion of our cardiothoracic surgeon that the object found in the right ventricle, which was (like all the other recovered objects) extremely dense, had physically struck the tricuspid valve and caused the perforation. Therefore, the objects in the major arteries were considered life-threatening. The patient was prepared for x-ray-guided removal of the aortic and caval deposits. The surgery was to be performed on hospital Day 20.\n\nOn Day 18, just after standing up, the patient complained of extremely severe pain centered in her groin and radiating to her lower back, her abdomen, and both legs. She rapidly developed tachycardia, hypotension, and mental confusion. Aortic rupture and valve dehiscence wereconsidered. An echocardiogram showed good function of the tricuspid prosthesis. An x-ray angiogram of the abdomen revealed two significant aortic bleeds: a large bleed at the bifurcation of the common iliac arteries, and a smaller bleed just above the level of the hepatic arteries. The patient went into hypovolemic shock and was sent for emergency surgery. The patient was placed under therapeutic hypothermia, cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated, the heart was arrested, and the aorta was cross-clamped to allow repair of the ruptures. The aorta was repaired with gelatin-sealed polyester prosthetics and strips of harvested pericardium. However, during the repair, numerous small dissections were noted along the length of the aorta, as well as significant aortic staining. The dissections were repaired with fibrin sealant and patching as necessary. The patient was warmed and weaned from bypass. Her heart began beating spontaneously, and her hemodynamic shock resolved. However, one hour postoperatively, the patient suddenly developed sinus tachycardia of 130 BPM with low QRS voltage and electrical alternans. Echocardiogram showed a pericardial effusion, and pericardiocentesis produced approximately 210 mL of blood. Angiography showed a 17-mm tear in the free wall of the right ventricle. The patient was rushed back to the OR. During placement of cardiopulmonary bypass cannulae, the patient went into ventricular fibrillation which was electrically cardioverted. The myocardial rupture was closed. Attempts were made to wean the patient from bypass, but she remained asystolic. She was maintained on ECMO for 10 hours, at which point she suddenly went into hypovolemic shock which was unresponsive to pressor or fluid support. She could not be resuscitated, and was pronounced dead.\n\nOn autopsy, numerous small metallic bodies were discovered embedded in the aortic wall. Larger ones were found in the liver, the calices of the kidneys, and the large muscles. A massive intraabdominal hemorrhage was discovered, originating from the site of the smaller aortic bleed. This was determined to be the cause of death.\n\nNo metabolic abnormalities had been found. There was no evidence of viral infection.\n\nThe university reported that they had performed several tests on the objects, but were unable to perform more, as one of their professors of chemistry had suddenly left the university and taken the samples with him. \n\nThey had determined that the objects were made of an unusual substance which they had not been able to identify and had not previously encountered. It produced no identifying signature on mass spectrometry, and they found the same isotropic x-ray diffraction pattern, even at extremely high energies. Gamma spectroscopy showed unusual excitations, but the noise level was too high for a meaningful analysis. Remarkably, they reported that the objects had a variable density of between 50 and 1,000 grams per cubic centimeter. There is no known or theorized chemical element with such a high density. The measurement was considered erroneous, but they were confirmed by three separate technicians using two separate sets of equipment. The university suspected deliberate tampering with results, but as the samples had been stolen, they were unable to confirm this.\n\nThe day of the patient's death, a man presented himself to the hospital, identifying himself as the patient's brother. He showed documentation to that effect, and became extremely angry when he learned that an autopsy had been performed. He said that he and the patient objected to autopsy on religious grounds, and demanded that the patient's remains be turned over to him, as well as any instruments or objects which had made contact with her blood. We were unable to comply with the latter request, and he demanded, under the threat of legal action, that the instruments and objects in question be destroyed and disposed of. After consultation with our legal staff, we complied with his wishes, and allowed the brother to observe while the instruments, bedding, and samples were incinerated.\n\nTwo weeks after the patient's death, a small gold ring was found in the corner of the patient's room. One of the shift nurses recalled seeing the patient wearing it. We attempted to contact the patient's brother, but the telephone number he had provided was out of service, and a courier reported that, when she took the ring to the address listed on his identification, that it was the address of a hardware store.\n\nThe patient's disease has not been identified.

However, superheavy nuclides *close* to that mass are predicted to lie in a hypothetical second \"island of stability,\" and some are predicted to be unusually dense and chemically refractory (though not as much as the metals in cases 8 or 14).\n\n*Maybe* element 164 (a heavy analogue of mercury) would exist as an amorphous metal and give the results seen in case 14's diffraction experiments.\n\nBut why is the metal mysteriously *growing* in this patient?

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea?

        "body": "My Mom had subtype 3, with thickened skin. She had it really badly her whole life. I have some rosacea but have done my best to try to not wind up like her.  Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

    "body": "Edit: title should be fatty alcohols not fatty acids but autocorrect thinks for me and sees me type acids a lot so naturally I must’ve meant acids. SIGH. \n\n**WARNING: LONG BUT I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE IT WORTH.**\n\nHey all!\n\nSoooo, years ago, I was a big advocate for the [idea that some people cannot use fatty alcohols](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1y3ql7/simple_tip_for_those_of_us_who_cant_use_fatty/). This was due to my experiences with CeraVe Cream, CeraVe Lotion, Cetaphil Cream, and Cetaphil Lotion, primarily. More, I was using Ziana (.025% tretinoin + clindamycin), which I have a strong suspicion in retrospect was the cause of a form of folliculitis for me (perhaps chemical folliculitis -- there are several types of folliculitis but in this case, acne that is not \"acne,\" but rather born of continuous irritation of the hair follicles). Of course, like *everyone* going through acne, I blamed every skin product I was using except the prescription active that was *designed* to make my acne better. After all, a doctor gave it to me, and a doctor wouldn't give me something that would make me \"sicker.\" \n\nUnfortunately, it turns out that by the time I started to figure this out, it was all way too late. To this day, I have light pitted scarring in places from an 8 month moderate-to-severe zit explosion on my face that never ceased. It has taught me a lot and pressed me to learn a lot about how skin *actually* functions. I was told the entire time I was breaking out that it was just \"purging,\" only to realize what a misnomer \"purging\" kind of is -- implying the skin is holding onto infections waiting to churn out of it's layers rather than comedones -- open or closed -- that are visible, as well as microcomedones that are the beginning of an acne spot but invisible to the naked eye. At the time, purging to me implied that there were acne spots in the deeper layers of my skin waiting to come out. \n\nSo in the process of me flailing, I felt like this class of ingredients that are otherwise harmless were my bane: fatty alcohols. These are stearyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, and cetyl alcohol. After all, they turned up in *everything* that was breaking me out, including the cleansers, so surely it had to be them, right? \n\nFor example, at one point, I was using Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser + CeraVe Cream. What do these products have in common?\n\n**Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser**\n&amp;gt; Water, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, **Stearyl Alcohol**, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben.\n\n**CeraVe Cream**\n&amp;gt;Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20 And **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauryl Lactylate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n\n---\n\nSo being the ingredient hound I am, I connected the dots to \"must be fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives.\" After all, everything else I used had had these ingredients too.\n\n**CeraVe Lotion**\n&amp;gt; Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceteareth-20 and** Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\n**Cetaphil Cream**\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Petrolatum, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, PEG-30 Stearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Propylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n**Cetaphil Lotion** *note - I believe this used to have macadamia nut oil in it when I used it and has since been reformulated. \n\n&amp;gt; Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ceteareth-20, **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Dimethicone, Sodium Levulinate, Sodium Anisate,Caprylyl Glycol, Benzyl Alcohol, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer\n\nHappy, I thought, \"This must be it! I solved it!\" So I cut out fatty alcohol products (which, as I am sure many of you know, is a *massive* pain in the ass) and [tried to facilitate others in doing the same](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ufvym/megalisting_products_without_cetylcetearylstearyl/). In fact, I feel like I was the primary champion of \"it might be fatty alcohols!\" back when this sub was only 25k people, and being as we were all learning from eachother and trusted eachother, many people trusted me in that assumption. After all, I had the proof (supposedly) to back it up.\n\nSo I used the lightest products, such as EltaMD PM (which is a wonderful product, don't get me wrong!). Unfortunately, my skin was parched *all of the time.* It was just sick. It kept breaking out for years after, bottle after bottle of EltaMD PM. Life happened, I was removed from the mod group for inactivity, and I just kept on with it - disappearing from this sub for a long-ass time.\n\nAnd then I started thinking... *what did I use before my skin started down this road?*\n\nBefore I knew jack-all about skin, I used Olay pretty religiously. Olay Regenerist, in the pot, with the fragrance. Yep. This stuff:\n\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Isohexadecane, Niacinamide, Isopropyl Isostearate, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Nylon-12, Dimethicone, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Sodium Peg-7 Olive Oil Carboxylate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ceratonia Siliqua (Carob) Fruit Extract, ** Stearyl Alcohol**, Polyethylene, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Dimethiconol, Polyacrylamide, Fragrance, Peg-100 Stearate, Propylparaben, Cetearyl Glucoside, **Cetearyl Alcohol,** C13-14 Isoparaffin, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, C12-13 Pareth-3, Laureth-7, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica.\n\n*\"[Wait a fucking minute](https://media.giphy.com/media/iAYupOdWXQy5a4nVGk/giphy.gif),\"* she thought. \"That shit has cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol and coconut derivatives all the shit I am avoiding. How the fuck did my face not explode then?\"\n\nSo I did something insane: I tried a cream with fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives that was being recommended on this sub at the time (lol). Some of you may recognize this:\n\n**Cheryl Lee MD Ceramide+**\n&amp;gt;Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Coconut), Petrolatum, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Polyglyceryl -10 Pentastearate, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Isostearyl Isostearate, Cetyl Alcohol, 1,3 Propanediol (from Corn), C10-30 Cholesterol/Lanosterol Esters, Ceramide 3, Phytosphingosine, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Niacinamide, Glycyrrhetinic Acid (Licorice Root), 1,2 -Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Gluconolactone.\n\nAnd you want to know something?\n\n90% of my acne healed in a week. 90% of the acne that had been causing me scars and *ruining my fucking life for years* healed in a fucking **week**. I looked back at all the ingredients for all the products that I had avoided and all the ones I had just been able to use fine as a teenager and by fucking god, what did I miss? **Ceteareth-fucking-20** (sans the cleansers -- I still don't know why my skin hated Cetaphil Gentle, but it turns out that it has broken out with every creamy, non-sudsy cleanser ever, so I've resigned myself to using gentle SLES cleansers for life).\n\nI felt like such a massive asshole. \n\nSo that brings me to now, when I decided on a train on a vacation in NYC to start a skin blog. I had spent those years researching my ass off about skin not to even see what a massive fuckup I had made. I had been able to help my BF bring his eczema 80% into control with bleach bath washes and solve my mom's chronically dry skin and my friend's weird case of eczema on his ring finger, but not my own skin. \n\nI came back to this sub after ~5 fucking years (4 of them AFK) and I still see a lot of people avoiding *all fatty alcohols*. I'm making this post to tell you that it might not be all fatty alcohols. It may be cet-20, like me, or it may be those fatty alcohols in combination with other ingredients (combinations of some ingredients can change molecular sizes, some manufacturers use different sources or molecular sized products, like larger or smaller hyaluronic acid, for example). There's so much complexity with skincare, skin, and ingredients that it usually isn't *one whole class of ingredients*. In short: **your mileage may vary**. This is why spot testing is important, one product isn't for everyone, and while ingredient labels are important for weeding out culprits, you also need to do a bit of research on how ingredients work with others to change how they interact on the skin. \n\nSince then, I've spot tested many of the products I flat-out ruled out and 1. it turns out everything with cet-20 does explode my face, 2. it turns out macadamia nut oil also explodes my face (in the cet lotion), and 3. turns out I can use 50% of the things I thought I couldn't (like jojoba oil!).\n\nI'm so happy that many of you have found this sub educational, but **please** consider what you've used in the past (skincare for face, makeup, EVERYTHING) and don't neglect those products when cross-identifying culprits. It changed my life and it might change yours.\n\nSome takeaways, with bullet points because I love bullet points:\n\n* Don't rule out entire classes of ingredients. Skin is super individual and it may be one stupid ingredient.\n* Don't take all of your skincare advice from the Internet, and if you do, try to diversify. Reddit, acne.org, MakeupAlley, medical journals -- get in there and become your own advocate.\n* Sometimes, skin is just an asshole and you won't be able to figure out what it hates. Example: My skin has issues with CeraVe healing ointment and foaming wash, despite them lacking cet-20. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n* Sometimes, what is considered \"good\" or \"best\" for skin isn't good or best for your skin. Example for me: creamy cleansers. They're definitely recommended *everywhere* for *every* skin condition, esp rosacea (which I have), but my skin fucking loathes them all. No idea why, and that's okay.\n* Just because an ingredient is \"good\" for skin doesn't mean it is good for your skin. Example: Me and high % niacinamide = zits. Me and low % niacinamide = k.\n* Just because it's a prescription doesn't mean it can't fuck you up, fam. I thought prescription = good, no problems here, won't cause issues. I have literal scars to prove me wrong. Instead of assuming all is well, **TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR IF SHIT IS UP AND IF YOUR DOCTOR IS LIKE HEY SHIT IS FINE BUT YOU STILL THINK SHIT IS FUCKED, GO TO ANOTHER DOCTOR**. I wish I had done this. Instead, my doc kept urging me to use it every single night. Went to a new doc and he was like, \"Oh no, your skin is very sensitive, that is wayyyy too harsh.\" Listen to your gut.\n* Almost alll skin rules are more like guidelines (except the baking soda, lemon juice, harsh harsh scrubs stuff - that's all still true since they can all throw your skin very out of whack). Example: I do better with light physical exfoliation once a week than AHA any day.\n\nThanks, and I'm sorry for being such a massive, incorrect asshole. I'm doing my best to correct my errors now (and hopefully go to esthetics school though BF is pushing me to do dermatology).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",

There needs to be someone on the medical side who can vouch for us not being complete loons about our skin. \n\nYes I have to agree with the sentiment of your post.... over the last few years my skin has been freaking out over every little thing. Too hot, too cold, aha, bha, B3, HA, phenoxyethanol the list goes on. \n\nFor 7months I used Tretinoin 0.025% and built up slowly (I thought), the purge happened. Traumatic. Then just unhappy skin.... but it is gold standard for my issues right? My face said no. \n\nAfter becoming ill last year, severely for 6+ months, all skincare and Tret use went down the drain. Just SS once a day, used as moisturiser. Rarely even washed my face in the evening I was too exhausted. \n\nWhat this did, apart from giving me Cc's and what have you. Was a chance for my skin to repair my moisture barrier on my face. Since medication has helped with the symptoms of my illness,  I have been able to use 1 product in my routine with phenoxyethanol as the main preservative, without it giving me painful pustles and nodules everywhere I experienced before. \n\nI have realised that the rash of whiteheads where ever I use a product with HA in and determined was the HA also happens with high levels of BG. So now planning to test a large molecular weight HA serum to see if I have the same issue without the BG. PG is fine... Propanidol is great. \n\nB3 🤔 causes flushing in my skin. And I'm not really interested in trying again.... \n\nBHA, again let me try again at some point. But method of application might be the issue here. \n\nSo vitamin c seemed out of the lexicon for my skin. I now have a silicone based C vit lined up to trial. \n\nFragerance/ essential oils can still mess me up doh. \n\nMoral of this story for me? Concentrate on keeping healthy skin barrier. The rest comes after.... so cleanse (favourite step), treat (calming, hydrating, emollient and then the acne/PIH target), protect. This approach has been working for me so far.",

    "body": "Panibagong sunscreen naman ang irereview ko. Ito ay yung SunProfessional Sunscreen with Orgasol Caresse ng Brilliant Skin Essentials. Yung white ang binili ko, since hindi ako gumagamit ng tinted sunscreens for personal use. Na-curious ako sa sunscreen na ito kasi ito yung first time kong makakita ng product kung saan hindi active ingredient ang main focus. Perfect chance din ito para magkaroon ako ng idea sa performance ng Orgasol Caresse na raw material, na di ko na kinakailangang i-source out yung mismong material at ipadala sa lab. For context, ang Orgasol Caresse kasi ay isang spheroidal powder na may oil-absorption capacity at nakakapagbigay ng powdery finish, lalo na sa mga products kagaya ng sunscreen (more on this later sa ingredients portion). Naubos ko na itong nabili ko, kaya naisipan ko na ding gawan ito ng review. \n\nUnang kapansin-pansin sa product na ito ay yung primary packaging nitong bote na hugis itlog. Infairness sa brand, pina IPO pa nila ito, at nakita ko mismo sa IG nung brand owner yung specs at design ng boteng ito. Magandang to laban sa counterfeiting, since laganap to ngayon both sa local at international brands. Maganda din ang pagkakaprint ng text sa bote, hindi nag-i-smudge kahit basa ang kamay ng tubig, pawis, or nung mismong product. \n\nNgayon naman, sa actual use. Itong sunscreen na ito ay isang opaque white na gel cream, na hindi ganoon kadaling mag-break down when in contact sa daliri o kamay. For context, may mga nasubukan na akong sunscreen na upon contact sa skin e nag-be-break na agad yung emulsion. Ito kadalasan yung sinasabi nung mga users na nagiging matubig or runny yung sunscreen kapag ginagamit nila. Scented itong sunscreen ba ito, pero hindi ganoon kalakas (for me) na tipong nakakasura. Sakto lang para ma-mask yung odor ng base formula. \n\nMadaling i-blend itong sunscreen na ito sa balat, and sa ilang saglit lang e nagseset na ito kaagad. Wala akong white cast na na-observe dito nung ginagamit ko. Aside sa blendability at absence ng white cast, may na-appreciate ako dito sa product na ito. May cooling effect sa balat, sakto sa mainit na panahon natin. Yung cooling effect nito ay hindi ganun katindi to the point na may stinging, subtle cooling effect lang. Kapag natuyo at nagset na sa balat itong sunscreen, dun ko naramdaman yung effect ng Orgasol Caresse na powdery feel nung hinaplos ko yung face ko. Matte ang naging finish nito sa akin, so in my opinion, ok to sa mga oily to combination skin na users. Wala din akong na-observe na pilling sa duration ng paggamit ko nitong sunscreen. Wala din akong naramdaman na stinging o hapdi sa balat nung ginagamit ko ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo sa ingredients. Ito ang ingredient list:\n\nWater, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, Butylene Glycol, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Nylon-6/12, Polyacrylamide, C13-15 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7, Titanium Dioxide, Dimethicone, Green Tea (Camellia Sinensis) Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Cucumber (Cucumis Sativus) Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sunflower (Helianthus Annuus) Seed Oil, Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Leaf Extract, Fragrance, Menthyl Lactate, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA\n\nMay apat na UV filters itong sunscreen na ito:\n\nEthylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (UVB) \nButyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane (UVA) \nOctocrylene (UVB) \nTitanium Dioxide (UVB) \n\nMay slight concern lang ako sa titanium dioxide na ginamit. Sunscreen-grade na titanium dioxide is usually coated with either aluminum hydroxide or silica. Mahalaga ang coating na yan for titanium dioxide dahil pinipigil ng mga coating na ito ang formation ng reactive oxygen species (ROS) kapag tinamaan ng UV ang Titanium Dioxide. Kahit coating yan, dapat isama pa din yan sa ingredient list. \nFor more information sa function ng aluminum hydroxide, pakitingnan na lang sa link below:\nhttps://incidecoder.com/ingredients/aluminum-hydroxide\nPara naman sa silica,  please see link below:\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925838810020128\n\nOk naman ang preservative system, since Phenoxyethanol at Ethylhexylglycerin ang ginamit, common preservative system na ginagamit ng mga brands na averse sa parabens. \n\nTingnan naman natin yung Nylon-6/12. Yan yung INCI name ng Orgasol Caresse. Yan ung nagbibigay nung mga skinfeel benefit at oil-control dito sa sunscreen na ito. Comparable itong ingredient na ito sa Silica at sa Polymethylsilsesquioxane (PMSQ), na kapareho nitong nagbibigay ng powdery after feel at oil-control benefit. \n\nAnother noteworthy na ingredient sa sunscreen na ito ay yung Menthyl Lactate. Ito yung nagbibigay sa sunscreen na ito ng subtle cooling effect sa skin during use. Related ito sa Menthol, ang kadalasang ginagamit na ingredient for cooling benefit. \n\nAng next comment ko sa ingredients nitong product na ito ay para sa mga cosmetic chemist at regulatory personnel na in-charge sa paggawa at pag-check ng IL. Sa product na ito, hindi na-take into consideration yung % composition nung mga raw materials na existing as blends or premixes. For example, sa UV filter, ang ginamit na raw material dito is SUNCAT MTA, isang raw material premix. Ang composition nitong raw material blend na ito ay yung first 6 ingredients na makikita nyo sa IL nitong product na ito. Kung ite-take into account yung % ng each component ng SUNCAT MTA, hindi dapat magkakatabi yung anim na yan, meron jan na dapat nasa ibabang part ng IL. This is the same din sa emulsifier system at preservative system na ginamit dito, hindi advisable na magkakatabi yan, since premix yung ginamit. Ngayon, bakit ko ito pinuna? Dahil pinapadali nito ang paggaya sa product nyo ng mga competitors nyo. So para dun sa brand, kung ayaw nyo magaya kaagad ng iba yung product nyo, please consider taking into account yung % composition nung mga mixture ingredients nyo para mapwesto ng maayos sa IL. \n\nPunta naman tayo sa product claims. Simple at straight forward ng claims nitong product na ito, base sa label. \n1. With Orgasol Caresse\n2. Broad Spectrum SPF 50 PA++++ UVA-UVB Protection\n\nClaim #1, napatunayan na natin yan sa ingredient list, Orgasol Caresse = Nylon-6/12.\n\nClaim #2, hindi ko alam kung nai-post na ba ng brand owner sa kanyang soc med yung SPF Test report. Yung brand owner na makakasagot nito. \n\nMay isang bagay lang akong napansin sa box nito. Hindi nakalagay yung mandatory warning statement, according sa ASEAN Sunscreen Labeling Guideline:\nDo not stay too long in the sun, even while using a sunscreen product. \nDapat lang talaga na ilagay ito sa label ng mga sunscreen product dahil madalas na nakakalimutan ng mga consumer na hindi advisable na magbabad sa ilalim ng sikat ng araw kahit pa na naka sunscreen. Once na mahulas yang sunscreen na gamit mo, masusunog at masusunog ang balat mo jan. \n\nFinal words regarding this sunscreen:\nAside dun sa mga comments ko regarding sa improvement ng ingredient list, absence ng mandatory warning statement, pati na sa non-inclusion ng ginamit na coating agents para sa titanium dioxide sa IL, ok naman itong sunscreen na ito overall. Good aesthetics, good formula, straight forward product claims na wala ng kuskos balungos. \n\nAyun lang, maraming salamat sa pagbabasa ng review na ito. \n",

Most products that claim to mend split ends don’t have these two ingredients. Also, both ingredients are required for the mending to work and withstand other stresses like combing. \n\n#Here’s the study done on these two ingredients showing the semi permanent mending effects: \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/6111412_Semi-permanent_split_end_mending_with_a_polyelectrolyte_complex\n\n##Brief explanation:\n\nThe cationic, anti static ingredient **polyquaternium-28** is attracted to the anionic ingredient **PVM/MA copolymer**. The idea is that damage and split ends are anionic so the polyquaternium-28 is attracted to them and will bind them together until it is washed out. In the study, these two ingredients were shown to bind together split ends and also withstood the stress of combing.\n\n#Here are some products I FINALLY found that have these two ingredients:\n\n#[Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum 4 oz ($20)](https://www.frendsbeauty.com/kim-kimble-healed-ends-serum-4oz.html)\n\nIngredients: \n\nWater (Aqua), **Polyquaternium-28**, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Arctium Majus Root (Burdock) Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail Extract, Malva Sylvestris (Mallow) Flower Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Saccharum Officinaru (Sugarcane) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Lactic Acid, Ethylhexyglycerin, Betaine, Hexylene Glycol, **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Dimethicone PEG-8 Meadowfoamate, Hexapeptide-11, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nThis one has **polyquaternium-28** as the 2nd ingredient, then some oils, a bunch of extracts, then the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 17th ingredient. Phenoxyethanol as the preservative is fine here since it is being used on the ends, not on the scalp.\n\n#[Color Proof SuperRich Split Ends Mender 3.4 oz ($11)](https://www.beautyplussalon.com/color-proof-superrich-split-ends-mender)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Glycerin, **Polyquaternium-28**, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, Fragrance (Parfum), **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Polysorbate 80, Caprylyl Glycol, Linalool, Citric Acid, Limonene, Sorbitan Oleate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Citronellol, Citral, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Quaternium-95, Propanediol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Extract, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Hydrolyzed Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Lentinus Edodes Extract, Tocopherol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Benzoate, BHT, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate.\n\nThis ingredients list is interesting, **polyquaternium-28** as the 3rd ingredient is awesome, but the 4th, 5th, and 6th ingredients are two preservatives and a fragrance. That’s fine, as xanthan gum is also a thickener. Then the 7th ingredient is the **PVM/MA copolymer**. Then there’s a bunch of emollients and extracts and another preservative that is annoying to see in products. \n\n##This one contains Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, a **formaldehyde releasing preservative**. This is fine, as the formaldehyde is how it preserves the product, but it is always good to be aware of these things, so you don’t let the bottle sit for a very long time, as this ingredient **releases formaldehyde slowly over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[White Sands The Cure 24/7 Serum 3.38 oz ($20)](https://sleekshop.com/products/white-sands-the-cure-24-7-serum.html?sku=whs09-3-38-oz)\n\nIngredients:\n\nDeionized Water, **Polyaualerium-28**, **PVMMA Copolymer**, Xanthan Gum, Caprylic/Capric Acid, Triglyceride, Cyrribidium Grandilorioum Flower, Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate, Fragrance.\n\nThis one has a much more simple ingredients list! **Polyquaternium-28** is the second ingredient and the **PVM/MA** copolymer is the third ingredient. Then there is xanthan gum to thicken and preserve. \n\n##However, again, at the end of this list we have **formaldehyde releasing preservatives**: **Diazolidinyl Urea and Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate.** Again, this is fine, but good to be aware of so you don’t let the bottle sit for a year, as these preservatives **slowly release formaldehyde over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[OGX Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream 6 oz ($9)](https://www.ulta.com/p/locking-coconut-curls-air-dry-cream-pimprod2005306)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater (Aqua), Tapioca Starch, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Polyquaternium-37, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Polyquaternium-28**, **PVM/VA Copolymer**, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Lecithin, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nHere we have tapioca starch to reduce any heavy oily feel. Then some emollients and oils. Then **polyquaternium-28** as the 7th ingredient and the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 8th ingredient. Then there’s some more emollients and then the preservative and a fragrance. Phenoxyethanol is a fine because this is for use on the end of the hair, not the scalp. \n\nSo there you have it. You can semi-permanently mend your split ends. It took a LONG time for me to find products that actually had the *combitnation* of BOTH of these ingredients. \n#So if anyone else finds more products that contain polyquaternium-28 and PVM/MA copolymer, please share here!\n\nAlso, for those that can’t tell, the links are imbedded in the title of the product. So, for example, you can click on the title Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum at the top of the post and it will take you to the website. The links are imbedded in every title",

You can't do the usual high heat canning/bottling because it will break the emulsion. \n\n\"Mayonnaise, salad dressings, ketchups and comparable products are preserved by a combination of low pH (adjusted by acetic and citric acid), low aw (mainly depending on the relative levels of oil, water and salt in the formulation), and – sometimes – preservatives such as sorbic and benzoic acids. The target pH value depends on the level of other inhibitory factors such as aw [water activity] and the presence of preservatives, but is generally about 4.0. In contrast to ketchups, emulsion-type products cannot be pasteurized after mixing. When designing the formulation of the latter products, one must take into account the partition coefficient of the preservative agents between the water and the oil phase.\"- from [Food Preservation Techniques](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9781855735309/food-preservation-techniques)\n\nYou might get more detailed/expert advice from r/foodscience.",

Mayo should be at 4.1 pH or below, which is considered \"acidic.\" I think below 4.6 is the normal definition for an acidic food, so mayo definitely qualifies.\n\nMost of the salmonella outbreaks caused by mayonnaise in the 50s and 60s were from pH being too high and bacterial growth commenced.\n\nPowered citric acid is an easy way to acidify without adding too much water content, and would still be a natural ingredient.\n\nAs for how much / how long / how shelf stable - definitely send your stuff out for testing! I know from the beer industry, there are labs that you can send your finished or unfinished product to and they can test for all sorts of contaminants, so you can be sure what you're producing is stable, safe and quality. It's not all that expensive either. My buddy works at a brewpub that only distributes in cans (aside from kegged in their actual pub) in about a 100mi radius, and they send out cans about every 3 months to be tested, and adjust their processes as needed.

Perhaps in due time we can have another spreadsheet as ppl begin pH testing their own products... but here's what I have for  now! (and ofc I'm happy to update this list w/ any comments that come into this post << I have not done this yet for this post, will update at end of day or so!!)      \n\nI'm lumping shampoos & body washes together b/c IMO surfactants are surfactants are surfactants so any body wash can be used on the hair and vice versa (and face, honestly, if the ingreds are gentle enough - but as it so happens, few of these are)   \n\n- don't laugh yall, but one of the lowest pH & lowest cost options out here is ~intimates~ body wash. our lady gardens have a low pH and so do the washes designed for that area.    \nSummer's Eve is quite inexpensive, you can get 45oz (15oz x3) for only $13 on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=summer%27s+eve)! simple ingredients too: *Purified Water, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, Decyl Glucoside, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Ammonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Disodium Edta, Fragrance, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Fd&C Blue No. 1*. those who are prone to SD are advised to avoid SLES & SLS, but some can tolerate ALES, so I might try this for shampoo - why not?! my husband might be a little confused but whatevs #killinthegame     \n[and as for exactly what pH it is, website says: *Summer’s Eve’s pH-balanced products are formulated to be in harmony with the areas on which they are used. For topical application to the skin, they are formulated for a slightly acidic pH (about 5-6). For application to the vagina, they are formulated for mildly acidic pH (a pH of about 3.0-3.5).* I'm not certain which category washes fall under lol]\n\n- [Aqua Glycolic](http://www.aquaglycolic.com/product-aqua-glycolic-shampoo-body-cleanser) makes a pH 4.5 shampoo/body wash with 14% glycolic acid, retails ~$16/8 oz      \n\n- [Neutrogena T-Sal](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/t-sal-+therapeutic+shampoo+-+scalp+build-up+control.do?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=PLA+-+Hair+-+SKU&utm_term=&utm_content=|mkwid|sQN6gfQPl_dc|pcrid|121181768720) has long been my go-to during SD flareups, a bit pricy to use regularly though (~$7/4.5 oz). it's 3% salicylic acid and I remember reading somewhere the pH is ~4.5     \n\n- everything from [Sebamed](https://www.sebamedusa.com/facial-cleanser#?offset=0&limit=24) is listed as pH 5.5, with the exception of a feminine care wash that's listed as 3.8 (I've seen it on some etailers but not on their official website, possibly DC'ed?) & a post-menopausal feminine care wash listed as 6.0; their shampoos and body washes aren't cheap tho. Cerave foaming is cheaper per oz <-- not sure how it would fare as a shampoo, but I bet Cerave would be a perfectly fine option for body wash!   \n\n- u/ms_moonlight recommends shampoos from \"*Keracare. It's marketed towards black women, but anyone can use it.*\" this makes sense, as relaxers are often super basic, so acidic shampoos are very important. after researching this brand a bit, I can confirm that all of their shampoos & conditioners list their pH on the front! I've seen anything from [4.5](https://www.amazon.com/AVLON-Keracare-Lather-Shampoo-Ounce/dp/B0054Y1KO2/ref=sr_1_10_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1473012244&sr=8-10&keywords=keracare+shampoo)-6 (and even lower for their conditioners). sells for about $10/8 oz (but you can find cheaper) to under $20/1L, easily available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=keracare+shampoo)!\n\n- Many salon/higher end brands are labeled with pH 4.5-5.5; of these, Joico can often be obtained relatively inexpensively at $20-30 for 1L, but u/oliviart123 cautions: *NEVER buy (american) professional salon brands anywhere OTHER than a licenced salon. It is illegal for someone to sell them on amazon/ebay and at drugstores like target/walgreens/walmart, even costco. Theres a huge black market for counterfeit salon products which is why you \"see\" them everywhere. No salon brand actually sells on amazon and most of the bottles will say its only gaurenteed to be legit IF purchased from a licensed salon.*   \nrelated, I know [Sally Beauty](http://www.sallybeauty.com/shampoo/Hair01,default,sc.html#~EDGE~!sort.axis__default~~!page.size__48~~page.number__1~~!curated.hair_solutions__Color%20Protect!~EDGE~) tends to have a lot of pro-quality stuff at pleb prices, so I'd be interested to see if any of their shampoos list pH's   \nalso, I believe Nexxus Therappe is also in the correct range\n\n- u/julietpae suggests [Malibu C](https://www.malibuc.com/catalog/cn/60/shampoos) shampoos *Malibu products are designed from a Vitamin C/ascorbic acid complex that is proven to stop and prevent oxidizers from effecting your hair. Most of all their products are vegan/gluten/sulfate/paraben and fragrance free* I haven't been able to confirm their pH anywhere, but maybe it's listed on the bottle?    \n\n- lastly, not surfactants, but u/im_twelve_ and u/thee_zohan both recommend the Herbal Essences cleansing conditioners. u/okayzac adds: it's good to use something purifying still once in awhile. Things like cleansing conditioners that do not provide any surfactant cleanse can potentially lead to hair loss (i.e Wen is being sued over this) we can build up the hormone DHT which when we reach too high of levels can lead to hair loss.   \n\n    FYI: any \"no more tears\" baby shampoo probably has pH ~7\n\n\n**Asian/international products**   \n\n- Lador acid shampoo: pH 4.5, $8/150ml from [Memebox](https://us.memebox.com/damage-protector-acid-shampoo?pdref=category)   \n\n- u/noys has pH tested Ryoe damage care shampoo as 5.5, kracie moisturizing shampoo 5.5-6. u/okayzac lists the Ryoe anti-aging shampoo as HG (not pH tested, but hopefully similar!)  \n\n- u/marybanana says the Ka'fen acid shampoo series (marketed towards color protection) from Taiwan lists *shampoo is 5.4, and the conditioner is 4.0. It's been two weeks, and my scalp has shown distinct improvement* but hasn't found a good ordering source yet  \n\n- u/xomandark *Whamisa has a line of shampoo (one for oily scalp, one for dry scalp) and they are both pH 4.5. I used the dry version for quite some time and it was pretty soothing to my easily irritated scalp. They also have a scalp tonic which is THE BEST at calming irritation* ordered from testerkorea   \n\n- breathlessly waiting for the exact brand name from u/neko-miko *Since I started Keratin treatments, I had to stop using shampoo with sulphates and sodium chloride.\nAfter searching for a while (and using the Sebamed shampoo which was fine and also cheaper in Germany), I now use a super cheap low-ph shampoo / shower gel combo made for kids which fulfills all my requirements and costs less than 1€.\nI haven't had any scalp problems since.*   \n\n- Eucerin makes a [pH 5 shampoo](http://int.eucerin.com/products/dermocapillaire/ph5-mild-shampoo) but it doesn't seem very easy to order (or at least, I'm not nearly as savvy with sources for ordering from Europe as from Asia haha)    \n\n\nIf you google around, pplz on the Internet have also done some pH testing, e.g. [here](http://www.thenaturalhavenbloom.com/2012/02/ph-of-shampoo-ultimate-list.html), [here](http://forums.longhaircommunity.com/showthread.php?t=90642), [here](http://acovant.com/shampoo.html)",

I've been washing my face with a \"feminine hygiene gel\" for 3 weeks now (for Europeans: **Facelle intim Waschlotion Sensitive**, available in Rossmann) and it's been great. I wasn't expecting fireworks, it's just a cleanser, but it does the job very well, no tightness, no irritation. And it just couldn't get any cheaper! I've been meaning to start using it all over my body, but I have this deliciously smelling shower gel that I can't give up just yet :)\nThe pH is 4,5, it almost doesn't foam at all with hands, but foams nicely with a konjac sponge.  \n  \nIngredients:\n*Aqua, Lauryl Glucoside, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Sorbitol, Urea, Propylene Glycol, Allantoin, C12-15 Alkyl Lactate, Parfum, Serine, Sodium Lactate, Butylene Glycol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, Persea Gratissima Fruit Extract, Ethoxydiglycol, Bisabolol, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid*\n \n\nSorry this isn't AB, but I felt the need to share this fantastic discovery.

    "body": "Companies sometimes share the percentage retinol they use, but it's good to realize this is sometimes not the percentage of the pure retinol, but of a mixture.\n\nPhrases like \"1% coated retinol\" , \"a 1% retinol complex serum\" or we use \"0.5% slow release retinol\" are indicications they could be referring to a mixture/complex. Percentages like 2.5% or 3% are very unlikely pure retinol. There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M. Asam Retinol 1% Intense:**\n\n* Claim: 1% retinol in encapsulated form\n* Indications it's not 1%: Retinyl Palmitate is usually used below 0.3%. Polyurethane Crosspolymer-1 and Glycine Soja Oil are part of RetiCap PF, most likely this serum contains 0.08% Retinol.\n* Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, **Retinyl Palmitate, Retinol,** Panthenol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Tocopherol, Lauroyl Lysine, Dipentaerythrityl Pentaisononanoate, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl- 10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, **Polyurethane Crosspolymer- 1,** Caprylyl Glycol, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Second example, Inkey List Retinol Serum:**\n\n* Claim: 1% stable retinol and 0.5% granactive retinoid\n* Indications it's not 1%: Tocopherol, Carbomer in general are not used above 1%. Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula.

Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens® B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70. With all the fragrance ingredients lie Limonene, Grapefruit Oil and Lavender Oil it's best to skip this product.\n* Water, Glycerine, Dicaprylylcarbonaat, Isoamyl Lauraat, Cyclopentasiloxaan, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Boter, Shea Butter Cetyl Esters, Triheptanoin, **Tocoferol, Phenoxyethanol,** Behenyl Alcohol, Methylpropaandiol, Glycerylstearaatcitraat, Polysorbaat 20, Natriumacrylaten Copolymeer, **Retinol,** Glycerylstearaat , Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Limonene, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, etc...\n\n**Fourth example, Sunday Riley A+ High Dose 6.5% Retinoid :**\n\n* Claim: 5% retinoid ester, 1% liposomal-encapsulated retinol, 0.5% blue-green algea\n* Probably the 5% refers to Granactive Retinoid, you can't use 50% of this, so that means there's 0.5% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens® B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well. Otherwise some options below. \n\n* UK: Dermatica - \"otc\" tretinoin\n\n* US: Curology - \"otc\" tretinoin or Adapalene\n\n* [Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice.com/clinical-1pct-retinol-treatment/801.html) - $58/30mL\n\n* [Avene RetrinAl 0.1% Retinaldehyde](https://www.aveneusa.com/retrinal-intensive-cream) - $70/30mL\n\n* [Geek&Gorgeous 0.05% Retinaldehyde](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/a-game-5) $13.50/30mL",

Because with a brief look earlier I saw the Palmitamide MEA in it and thought it's one of the ceramides (the names are so similar haha!). However, today I saw incidecoder mentioning it as just a viscosity controlling ingredient (and I usually find them quite accurate), but more things came up where I saw something from mdedge [here](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/74188_main.pdf) stating \"Palmitamide MEA (PEA) is an important component of MimyX nonsteroidal cream, Dr. Smith said. PEA is an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties\" but this doctor has a consulting agreement with Stiefel Labs, which manufactures Physiogel. Also came across this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/) but it's testing a synthetic ceramide PC-104 in combination with other things like Palmitamide MEA, grapeseed extract etc. Plus, I remember reading an AMA from kindofstephen where he said \" I think most cosmetic companies would attribute patents as a marketing cost. Most novel patents I've seen in the cosmetic industry are to deal with delivery vehicles (like an airless soft container, etc)\". My takeaway is things can be patented even if they're not doing too much, because to consumers it seems like it's doing a lot? And now idk if this ingredient/Physiogel is any good as a ceramide cream or it's just a good plain heavy moisturiser.\n\nEdit: Realised this ingredient is present in Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume, along with SK-Influx, where it's described as \"Atoderm Intensive Baume quickly stops itching and reduces the urge to scratch thanks to its anti-itching dermatological active ingredient PEA\"\n\nMy understanding is Physiogel doesn't have any ceramides or cholesterol/phytosterols (looks like Zeroid uses phytosterols in place of cholesterol?), but has PEA as a fatty acid (skin similar ingredient), so it must be a good moisturiser but not an ideal-ratio ceramide moisturiser.",

    "body": "Hey guys! I haven't really heard this product being talked about in here, so I thought I would write a review/first impressions. \n\n**Skin1004 Zombie Pack** (Korean)\n\n\nHi my name is Bluecowboyboots and I am a mask addict. \n\n*hello bluecowboyboots*\n\nI sheet mask daily, I am constantly looking for new sheet masks to try and I scare my boyfriend and dog constantly looking like Jason from Friday the 13th. My bfs nickname for me sometimes is Sheet Mask Monster\n\nHowever, for the past two months I have avoided all wash off masks because I have been repairing my skin that was very dehydrated and irritated. \n\n**BUYING**\n \nAfter reading one of my favorite mask dedicated blogs Maskepedia, I was browsing and came across her [Post](https://maskepedia.com/2017/09/26/review-skin1004-zombie-pack/) on the Skin1004 Zombie Pack. What intrigued me was that it was able to \"diagnose\" your skin (not sure if it is a gimmick or not) and provide instant results.\n \nI freaked!! It looked like a similar mask to [Hanacure](https://www.hanacure.com/products/the-all-in-one-facial-set) that my friends rave about but without the $110 price tag. \nDespite all my friends rave reviews, I couldn't justify spending $110 dollars on a treatment that includes FOUR applications that total to $27.5 Each. \n\nI impulsively bought it on Amazon for $19.98 dollars. It includes 8 treatments (thats $2.50 a treatment. heck yeaah dolla make me holla!) \n\nIt came to my house in two days  *thanks amazon prime/bae* (don't tell my bf) \n\nThe powder consists of nine organic ingredients including albumin, corn powder, aloe berry leafy extract and lavender oil, while the activator contains over 15 ingredients that work mainly on pore tightening and wrinkle care.\n\n\n**FIRST IMPRESSIONS**\n\n\nSkin1004's [website](http://www.skin1004indonesia.com/product/detail/skin1004-zombie-pack-8pack-brush) \nclaims that it is:  \n\nA 8-in-1 full-face TREATMENT MASK : in only 15 minutes, get a facial that\n1. Reduces fine lines and wrinkles,\n2. Visibly lifts up your skin,\n3. Clears small breakouts and acne\n4. Tightens enlarged pores,\n5. Hydrates your skin deeply,\n6. Improves skin texture by gently removing dead cells,\n7. Balances the epidermis pH level,\n8. Brightens your complexion with a \"just-came-out-the-spa\" glow\n\n\nMore claims from [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Skin1004-Zombie-Pack-set-treatments/dp/B06XZV7ZGC/ref=sr_1_3_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1542723676&sr=1-3&keywords=skin1004%2Bzombie%2Bpack&th=1)\n\n\"NO PAIN, NO GAIN! 15 minutes of horror for a 15 years younger-looking skin… doesn’t sound so bad! After mixing the powder and activator, apply the mask on your face and feel it getting to work instantly!\"\n\nPore Tightening: The Zombie Pack will instantly tighten pores for a visible effect. \n \nSkin Lifting: Active ingredients such as Albumin help to instantly lift the skin while Copper Peptide and Rose of Jericho help to strengthen the skin\n\n**MAIN INGREDIENTS**\n\n*Albumin : Known as a component from eggs, this is a protein made of amino acids, and is effective for attracting moisture to the skin - this is great for skin elasticity!*\n \n*Centella Asiatica : Effective for soothing and calming the skin, this ingredient is especially perfect for those with acne prone, or sensitive skin.*\n\n\n**Powder ingredients:**\n\n*Albumen, Zea Mays (Corn) Starch, Silica, Allantoin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Panthenol, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Propolis Extract, Fragrance*\n\n**Activator ingredients:**\n\n*Water, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Niacinamide, Centella Asiatica Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Rosa Centifolia Flower Extract, Hippophae Rhamnoides Extract, Betula Alba Juice, Anastatica Hierochuntica Extract, Adenosine, Allantoin. Panthenol, Copper Tripeptide-1, Glycerin, Sodium PCA, Disodium EDTA, Arnica Montana Flower Extract, Echinacea Angustifolia Extract. Commiphora Mukul Resin Extract*\n\n**COMMENTARY**\n\nThe ingredients really intrigued me, I liked how it contains Centella because my skin LOVES it for my redness. Ingredients like Centalla, Niacinamide and Aloe are pretty high up on the list. \n\nI know many people with sensitive skin can't do fragrance, but weirdly lavender oil has never really bugged my skin. \n\nThe package comes with 8 powder packets (attached together so you can break them off), 8 activator packets (in a sealed bag) and a brush. \n\nThe instructions are to pour the activator in the powder packet and mix it to a liquid consistency. \n\n\n**PRE MASKING :**\n\nMy skin: \n\nIt is almost winter in the midwest and my skin has been very dry, slightly dehydrated and red.  \nMy concerns are : \n\n- Visible pores around my nose \n\n- lots of redness and PIE from hormonal breakouts on my jawline and some of my cheeks. \n\n- forehead wrinkles ( I am 24, and I want to be preventative as well) \n\n- irritation: my skin HATES physical scrubs, clay masks etc \n\n\n**MASKING**\n\nI apply the whole mask over my face per what the directions. I applied a little bit more around my areas of concern (my nose and cheeks and jawline/chin) \n\nThe directions said to wait 15 minutes and leave the mask on for the long TOPS. \n\nI double cleansed my skin and applied the mast. \n\nThe mask kind of smelled like egg, but that didnt really bug me. It was drippy and I accidentally dripped some on my dog (sorry doggo) \n\nFirst few minutes, the mask was starting to dry, i felt no irritated. \n\n5 minutes later - HOLY CRAP my face started to feel tight. I could make NO expression. \n\n10 minutes later - it kind of started to itch a little but I told myself I would stick it for 5 more minutes (no pain no gain amirite?) \n\n15 minutes later - I looked in the mirror, crap. I looked scary. My bf said I looked like I was 88 years old. My face felt tight and frozen. I LOOKED LIKE A ZOMBIE OLD LADY\n\n**DIAGNOSING MY SKIN**\n\nThe website says areas that are bumpy are Areas that lack elasticity, and are prone to wrinkles.\nAreas that are cracked are areas that lack hydration \n\nI thought that I would have bumps on my forehead. But in all actuallity pretty much my whole face was cracked. (SMH -_-) \nThe only areas that were bumpy were my undereye area, temples and my smile lines.\n\nWhat does this tell me? That I need to load up on hydration more (drink a lot more water) and maybe get a better eyecream haha \n\n**DID MY SKIN LIKE IT?**\n\nI washed it off, my skin felt pretty tight. and it was a bit red but ohhh myyyy. My pores looked so much smaller and my skin looked a little bit brighter. \n\nI showered, continued on with my night routine and went to bed. \n\n\nWaking up, my skin looked super smooth, my pores were still small and there was little redness except for a few pimples I had on my jawline. I looked a lot brighter.\n\n\n**MY THOUGHTS**\n\nDo you want to scare your BF or significant other into thinking your age is actually 64 years older than you said. \n\nDo you want all your friends to laugh at a photo you sent them asking \"What is wrong with your face?\" \n\nDo you want your face to look pretty and smooth like an instagram filter the next day? \n\nDo you want to not spend $110 dollars on a Hanacure mask? \n\nIf you answered yes to one of those, this mask is for you! \n\nThe instructions say to do it 3 times a week. but I don't think my sensitive skin will be able to handle that so I will save it for special events or if I am bored and want to spook people. [mwahahaha](https://giphy.com/gifs/planning-happy-gif-evil-plan-14nNwczrhgaQ5G)\n\nOverall id give it a 4/5, I loved the price point, it was fun, and I would deff buy it again but I havent used it enough for HG status. \nI also really liked the brush it came with. \n\nWhere you can buy it :\n\n[Amazon]( https://www.amazon.com/Skin1004-Zombie-Pack-set-treatments/dp/B06XZV7ZGC/ref=sr_1_3_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1542723676&sr=1-3&keywords=skin1004%2Bzombie%2Bpack&th=1) for $19.87 USD \n\n[YessStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/skin-1004-zombie-pack-set-powder-2g-x-8pcs-activator-3-5ml-x-8pcs/info.html/pid.1066657689) for $15.16 USD - It is on sale right now! \n\nI will be posting this review on my Instagram as well: [@lafilledifficile_](https://www.instagram.com/lafilledifficile_/)\n\n\nEDIT : Opps pardon my research but someone last year reviewed the same mask, you can find that review [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/6oxkff/review_skin1004_zombie_pack_korean_special_facial/) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ",

The drying part is so uncomfortable, at minute 10 I’m ready to claw my face off. The part where there are bumpy parts and cracked parts are true, interesting to experience where those parts are, somewhat what I expected. \nBUT, your skin looks amazing after, I have dry acne prone skin and it does not irritate it from what I’ve experienced. I wash my face first, apply, rinse off then use a cleansing toner after and apply a face oil before bed. Wake up and skin looks great. Almost as if life’s horrors haven’t aged me an extra 10 years. I use it maybe once a week if I have time, I can see how twice a week would help but for cost and saving money I’m happy with once every 1-2 weeks.",

    "body": "For the purposes of this review of multiple products, I’ll be *categorizing items by routine placement* rather than when it was introduced.  These items are very much YMMV but I thought it may be helpful for some who are newer to AB (seen with the large influx of newbie questions I’ve seen in the DHT) or even those wondering about products generally.  Also **this isn’t a particular look at my routine(s)** or how my routine has transformed as I’ve learned more about my skin; rather, this review is of products used to target particular concerns.  This mega-review really came about after a response comment from /u/theCuriousAmerican (whom I thank for keeping me and much of the board in the loop regarding newer products/ lesser known brands in Korea).  I am over 30 but I haven’t started picking out my coffin lining just yet (rose gold silk, plz) so be aware this isn’t really an anti-aging post as I don’t consider myself having “mature” skin (whatever that means).  As I go through reviews, I’ll also include my rational as to why I purchased a product if it wasn’t impulse and link any relevant posts from the sub that informed my purchase. \n\nI've decided to break up this review and present categories like a series.  This post will be centered around 1st cleansers, hydrating toners, and serums.  The second post will be centered around oils, moisturizers/occlusives, and masks. *Also, I will only discuss AB/ sub-related products*. While I went through a smattering of samples, they will not be discussed. All products discussed were used for at least 2-3 months, if not longer. \n\nAbout my skin prior to developing a skincare routine: \n\n- extremely oily\n\n- flaky under makeup (my makeup would separate in hours and have dry patches)\n\n- riddled with closed comedones (whiteheads)\n\n- bumpy skin texture (under the skin pimples)\n\n- uneven skin tone, hyperpigmentation (PIH)\n\n- icepick scars\n\n\n**1st Cleanser**:\n\n\n*Heimish All Clean Balm*\n\n- Ingredients: [Posted from CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2186231803.html) so take with a grain of salt as anyone can add or delete ingredients. \n\n\nI've been using this balm since February. My initial impression was satisfaction. It melted well (not as well as Clinique's Take The Day Off), a slight herbal/citrus smell which didn't bother me, and a lower price point than TTDO. The price is really the main positive of this product. I don't find it cleans as well as TTDO so I have to use more product to make sure everything is eliminated. Nowadays I don't even wear a full face or any makeup at all really except Heroine waterproof mascara and Beauty People Lip Tattoo. I usually let this balm sit on my face for a minute or two before going at it and it does remove most of these products. Into May, I'm still satisfied with this product. Sometimes I only use this cleanser at night if I wasn't wearing anything but sunscreen since it does the job and I've worn a full face and it does remove base makeup well enough (even though I need to use more of it). It'll also last a bit longer, I'm thinking 2-3 more months, so at least 6 months of use for me. I also like that this comes in travel size (I got a few from a Ohlolly.com promo).\n\n\nRepurchase? I'd likely repurchase TTDO if choosing between the two, yes TTDO is more expensive but I liked that it removed makeup easier, it melted better as well. \n\n\nFor my next 1st cleanser, I'll likely repurchase TTDO or make my own cleanser as a way to dupe Tatcha's oil cleanser (beautiful cleanser, only had a sample but loved the feeling). \n\n\n**Hydrating Toners**\n\n\n*Kikusamusane High Moist Lotion* (30 mL decant)\n\n- Ingredients: [From CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_5173202878.html)\n\n\nRemember mid-2016 when kikumasamune was on everyone's lips? I purchased a decant of this hydrator partially on the [buzz](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3tgula/a_letter_to_kikumasamune_high_moist_lotion/?st=j2jobol7&sh=17239e4e) created by the sub and other blogs.  This product seemed like a good way to target PIH and increase hydration for my dehydrated skin.  It took me about 2 months to get through my decant. I'm not gonna go through my use of this product because it's been discussed by this sub so much (do a google search). \n\n\nRather, I'll discuss why I ended up not purchasing a full size of this product. I ended up not purchasing a full size because by then I felt my skin didn't need what the Kiku was offering. I didn't get any significant lightening of PIH, brightening yes but I felt I could get brightening from other products. I could get hydration from other products as well.  And I suppose I just wasn't *impressed* enough to want to purchase it. This was also when I realized I get bored of products and the thought of purchasing a 500 ml product seemed so daunting to finish. LOL. \n\n\n*Hada Labo Albutin Lotion Moist*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Arbutin, Disodium Succinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Methylparaben, PPG-10 Methyl Glucose Ether, Sodium Hyaluronate, Styrene/VP Copolymer, Succinic Acid, Tremella Fuciformis Polysaccharide (from hadalabousa)\n\n\nI recently finished this product (mid-April) and I'm so happy I never have to use this product again. LOL. I purchased this product in December on ABX. I primarily purchased it because of its ingredient list and was interested in using a product with MAP and Arbutin to see if it could attack my PIH in anyway. Also, I felt it would be another good addition for my skin that leans perma-dehydrated. Little to no smell, watery texture, and economical. \n\n**Performance**: Overall, I was significantly disappointed by this product and the longer my time away from this product the more I'm able to realize why I'm disappointed.  It just didn't do anything. It felt like I was throwing cloudy water on my face most of the time. Cloudy water that wasn't even showing a difference in my skin. I would take days off from using this product and saw no difference in brightness to my face. I also saw no lightening of PIH. I expect my toners to hydrate *at least* and it seemingly failed on this front as well. I added another toner to back up this one but I don't like wasting product so I finished it. I found it as a good way to give myself lotion masks and to hydrate my legs. Essentially, this may be the most boring product I've ever tried. \n\n\n*Meishoku Extra Moisturizing Lotion Moist* \n\n- Ingredients: [From cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f35b176780.html)\n\n\nI purchased this toner around December from the r/abx with the Hada Labo moist.  I didn’t know what to expect purchasing this product but I did based on the ingredients. I was searching for a product that had ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids. I should also add that I was searching for a product that had the 3-1-1 ratio because my face does best with a pretty constant use of acids and I needed something that would deliver on the moisture front. \n\n\n**Performance**: I can't actually say much about this product which I don't know if that's good or bad. It's slightly thicker than the HL moist, it's more moisturizing than HL and I feel like it does more than HL ever did. I still enjoy using it after all this time and I may even repurchase. It absorbs quickly, has no discernible smell, and is pretty economical for the amount you receive vs how long it lasts. If the product ingredient listing is correct and I understand how each ingredient fits, this product may have the 3-1-1 ratio (plz, correct me if I'm wrong as I'd love to know for sure!).\n\n\n*PyunKyang Yul Essence Toner*\n\n- Ingredients: Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\nMy newest toner purchase.  I’ve been using this toner for about 3 weeks so I can only give a first impression.  My main interest in this toner was sparked by [Gothamista’s YT review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9_mJoK4gr4) of this product when she covered the 7 skin layer method.  I was interested in finding another hydrating toner to try out the method as I felt that HL was too thin and really felt more like I was patting ‘cloudy water’ on my face every day. \n\n\nAbout the PKY line: The PKY line was developed by the Pyunkang Oriental Medicine Clinic (info provided by Ohlolly.com).  It boasts a list of ingredients commonly found in these types of products but I was especially interested in milk vecht root extract, which is an extract that I haven’t come across much in products. (NOTE: I've been searching high and low for any clue of what this ingredient does topically, can't find anything.) I’m a bit of a lover for simpler aesthetics.  I like it when bottles are plainly labeled and look like they belong in an apothecary.  In this sense, PKY hits all my wants; sleek and simplistic design, electric blue bottle (hard plastic), and **no** dropper. \n\n\n**Performance**: What I expected from this product was hydration and I can say this toner delivered.  The liquid is slightly thicker than HL lotion moist but not too much.  I live in a high humidity area and we’re going into summer but I don’t expect to rotate this toner out of my routine.  I tend to only need 2-3 layers for the skin method when I’m using this toner. I’ve tried doing up to 7 but my skin calls it quits in absorption around layer 5. But I'm also wondering if this product just isn't as easily absorbed as meishoku. I think this product would be a great skin soother, since it comes across as so ...mild and inoffensive (if that makes sense). \n\n\nHave I seen a discernible difference in my skin using this product?  I don’t think so. I would notice more if my skin didn’t get the proper hydration it needed from this product but I haven’t seen that. \n\n\nMISC: There is no discernible smell but I’m not sensitive to smells.  The bottle is 6.7 oz which is a lot of product and likely this bottle will last me at least 8 months, making the price ($19) very economical. \n\n\nIf I didn’t think I’d have another toner waiting to be purchased, I’d say I’d repurchase this but I already have my sights set on toners by kyotosilk and swanicoco.  \n\n\n**Serums**\n\n\n*OST20*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Ascorbic Acid, Alcohol, Sodium Lactate, Butylene Glycol, Glucose, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Xanthan Gum, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Flower Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Glycerin, Zinc PCA, Panthenol, Niacinamide, t-Butyl Alcohol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ubiquinone, Diisopropyl Adipate (from Wishtrend)\n\n\nI'm going to be honest, I won't say much about this product because this sub seems to have a love+hate relationship with it. But I feel like a complete *sucker* for using this product when Timeless's Vit C formula exists. Reviews by [Holysnails](http://www.holysnails.com/2015/03/a-rant-on-osts-c20-and-c215-serums-and.html) and [Fiddy](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2017/01/04/vitamin-c-serum-101-timeless-vitamin-c-serum-review/) and [sub reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4edywb/timeless_vitamin_c_e_ferulic_serum_review_with/?st=j2joba2v&sh=f554f12e) should have had me clicking to Timeless's site. \n\n\nBut no, I tried OST20 first (at least I don't have to wonder) came away disappointed (easily oxidized, serum-like feeling, faint smell, and a bit tacky on the skin). If I regretted purchases this would likely be the ONE I regret most, especially after using Timeless (water-like feel to the skin, subtle scent, stabilized with vit E and ferulic acid, great pricing). NOTE: Please purchase from Timeless's site, while offered on Amazon I can't say for sure that is Timeless's vendor. \n\n\n*Stratia Rewind*\n\n- Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, 2-Dimethylamino Ethanol (DMAE), Panthenol, Hydrolized Rice Protein, N-Acetyl Glucosamine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Tamarindus Indica (Tamarind) Seed Extract, Hydrocotyl (Centella Asiatica) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA\n\n\nAgain, this is another product that is known enough in the sub that I don't really feel like I need to say much. I purchased this product based on the ingredients. I wanted something with niacinamide + nag and licorice. Also, I wanted to support an independent maker who I know was knowledgeable about skincare. I was really interested to see what this product would do for my skin. NOTE: I purchased before stratia dropped the use of biokelp ferment so I've never tried the newest formulation. \n\n\nFor skin feel, this product was slightly oily but sank in well enough. I found it slightly hydrating/moisturizing but not heavy. It really did help with providing a boost of moisture to my skin while being soothing. \n\n\n**Performance**: Overall, I didn't see any significant change in my skin except for moisture/hydration. My PIH was not lightened and I didn't see significant brightening and really that's what I wanted. \n\n\n*Hungarian Water Essence*/*Mizon Hyaluronic 100 Serum*\n\n- Ingredients (BELIF): Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Officinalis(Sage) Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Peucedanum Graveolens (Dill) Extract, Alchemilla Vulgaris Extract, Rose Extract, Poncirus Trifoliata Fruit Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, *Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, *Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, *Nepeta Cataria Extract, *Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Leaf Extract, *Baptisia Tinctoria Root Extract, *Stellaria Media (Chickweed) Extract, +Alchemilla Vulgaris Leaf Extract, **Equisetum Arvense Leaf Extract, **Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Leaf Extract, **Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Triethylhexanoin, Tromethamine, Sclerotium Gum, Ammonium Acryloyldimethltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Trisodium EDTA, ***Fragrance, Citronnellol, Limonene. *Napiers Original Formula. **Napiers Aqua Formula. ***Fragrances of Natural Origin.\n\n- Ingredients (MIZON): Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Copper Tripeptide-1, Butylene Glycol, Sclerotium Gum, 1,2-octanediol, Ethylhexyl-glycerin, Tropolone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Carppyl/capric Triglyceride,Hydrogenated Lecithin, Stearic Acid, C12-c20alkyl Glucoside, C13-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholesteryl Hydroxystearate, Cholesterol, Ceramid 3, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Betula Platpyhlla Japonica Juice, Portaluca Oleracea Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, Amica Montana Flower Extract, Artemisia Absinthium Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Gentiana Lutea Root Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Rasberry) Fruit Extract, Beta-Glucan, Adenosine, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA\n\n\n**Performance**: I'm putting these two together because I felt like they acted as similar products. Very inoffensive serums with little to no scent. I couldn't pinpoint to their overall effect but I will say that when I started mixing them together before application I saw a def increase in the ...bouncy-ness of my skin. I can't explain it and I'm little miffed that separately they didn't perform but together I loved the effect. I refuse to purchase extract water as I got a deluxe sample size from Sephora (Belif got me on the moisturizer train already) and Mizon did very little for my skin alone so both were a dud in my opinion. \n\n\n******\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nI suppose I should discuss my skin now. Overall, I'm pretty happy with where my skin is although I think I'm gonna need laser work for some PIH or start on tret. I don't get flakes even in the face of all the actives I through at my skin. I barely purge (except for retinol) and I don't break out really. When I do breakout, it's usually from products/ environmental, not hormonal. I guess I have a semi-glow, although IRL I just look semi-sweaty or really shiny with makeup on. I'm not as oily and I usually don't get oily until about 4PM now and my makeup no longer separates. \n\n\nI think what's made the largest difference is introducing a hydrating toner. Before this I cleansed and moisturized but hydration was a key element that I wasn't getting. Adding hydration was such a wonderful step towards aiding my skin and I really think that in those who are new to AB, learning the importance of hydration is critical in understanding your skin. ",

What I have found to work the most for me  has been a monthly Glycolic peel (20%) coupled with regular (2-3 times a week) exfoliating and of course niacinamide and Alpha arbutin and sunscreen that blocks against HEV and IR  to stop new pigmentation from forming. It's a nightmare to maintain  but it was the only thing that works. I did try tret, the 0.5 one but it was really really drying on my skin and darkened my pigmentation unless I exfoliated which made it more dry. Such a pita.",

    "body": "Ceramides are AMAZING for repairing & replenishing the moisture barrier. =) They've personally helped me *a lot*. They don't always appear as \"ceramide \\_\\_\", there are other names for them, such as:\n\nHydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, Myristoyl/​Palmitoyl Oxostearamide/​Arachamide MEA, Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide, Hydroxypalmitoyl Sphinganine, [Safflower Oil/​Palm Oil Aminopropanediol Esters](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/safflower-oil-palm-oil-aminopropanediol-esters), etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo today I wanted to make a list of products that are easily overlooked when searching for ceramide skincare, because many people are only looking for the word \"ceramide\".

I wrote this months ago; just have a courage to post it now lol.\n\nEverything I wrote is based from my experience, knowledge from fellow redditors on r/AsianBeauty, r/SkincareAddiction, and A LOT of research. Always remember - **YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)** - what worked for others might not work for you and vice-versa. There's no universal treatment in acne or other skin concerns. Skincare is a process of trial and error. Take this post with a grain of salt. \n\nAlso, this is a lengthy post so if you don't have any patience to read this wall of text, shoo! (Ay ang hard haha). Seriously, this post is mostly composed of studies, anecdotes, and other references to support my claims. AYAW NATIN NG FAKE NEWS 'DI BA? \n\nFor clarification, I'm far from that Korean, dewy skin. I have suffered from acne vulgaris for years, but I'm confident that my face improved a lot. But this post wouldn't focus with my acne journey. I want this to be a general skincare guide. There may be some personal thoughts here and there but that would be it. \n\nLastly, I apologize if along the way I may have bent the rules of grammar. I'm just accustomed to explaining things in English. I might repeatedly edit this post if I could bring myself to thoroughly proofread this.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhile I know and appreciate that dermatologists know what products or practices are best for us especially our skin, I'm one of those enthusiasts who believe that it is much better if you know your OWN skin. For example, over my skincare journey I found out that my skin can't handle SLS but I can tolerate SLES, products with malunggay/ben oil break me out, etc. And these are findings a dermatologist can't just provide to me.\n\nYou'll probably get fed up with my skincare one liner - YMMV (Your Mileage May vary) - but this is crucial concept to be familiarized with. Everyone's skin is different. In a simple context - we have different sensitivity to cosmetic ingredients. YMMV but the components of our skin are all the same, just varies on how much you have vs how much they have.\n\nLet me provide you with some science. I'll try to explain this simply (as the saying goes, know and befriend your enemy), tho of course jargon can't be avoided. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**A LITTLE SCIENCE ON HOW OUR SKIN WORKS**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOur skin is composed of three layers - dermis, hypodermis, and epidermis. The most important of the three is the **epidermis** - the outer layer of the skin. Epidermis consists of 15-20 layers of cells which is mostly 95% of **keratinocytes**. They create proteins, with *Keratin* being the most major protein. They are made in the basal (deepest) layer of the epidermis - *Stratum basale/stratum germinativum*. Keratinoctyes present here undergo division and differentiation, half of it will remain in this basal layer, while the other half will further go upward into the upper layers until they reached the outermost layer of the epidermis - the **stratum corneum (SC)**. Keratinocytes in the SC are now keratinized or cornified, this is why they are also called Corneocytes. These keratinocytes in the SC or **corneocytes** are now dead skin cells, which regularly slough away (also called desquamation) and again replaced by Keratinocytes from the deeper layers. They are tightly bound together, forming the SC barrier (sometimes called epidermal barrier, moisture barrier), which plays an important role for a healthy skin.^[1,2]\n\nThis entire process of keratinization takes up to 4 weeks or approximately 28 days. \n\nOther cells present in the epidermis are:^[1,3]\n\n- Melanocytes - they protect our skin from harmful uv rays through their pigment called *melanin*. This pigment is black in nature, that's why when our skin is excessively exposed to sun, such cells produce more melanin. More melanin = darker spot. Heh! Don't blame melanocytes; blame yourself for not applying sunscreen. :P\n- Langerhans’ Cells - they uptake the antigens in our skin and carry them to the nearest lymph node. Specialized in fighting germs.\n- Merkel Cells - enables us to sense pressure because of their sensory function. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nNotice how I focused with the Epidermis 'cause this is where skin diseases usually arise. I hope I haven't lost you yet. Skin actually involves complicated processes; the one I mentioned above is just a simplified version.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGoing back to stratum corneum (SC). SC is the most superficial layer of epidermis. It is also called 'horny layer' because *stratum corneum* is a latin term which literally translates to horny layer. \n\nAnd now the SC barrier. SC barrier is usually described through the *Bricks and Mortar* model. Construction of SC barrier resembles a wall in which layered *corneocytes* stand for *bricks*. Desmosomes keep them intact. Intercellular lipids are the cement which stand for *mortar*.^[2,4]\n\n[Visualization](http://www.ajicjournal.org/cms/attachment/2006299184/2028507809/gr3.jpg)\n \nThese bricks main job is the SC's hydration. This is because of the presence of **natural moisturizing factors** (NMFs). NMFs provide moisture retention because of its humectant property. Humectant bonds with water molecules to increase water content in the skin. Some \ncompounds also have the ability to attract moisture from the environment. NMFs are comprised of amino acids, carboxylic pyrrolidone acid, lactic acid, urea, glucose, and mineral ions.^[5-7]\n\nThe mortar, intercellular lipids, are mostly **ceramides** or sphingolipids (50%), remaining would be 25% of **cholesterol**, and 15% of **free fatty acids**. Together, they strengthen the permeability barrier, warding off external irritants; help in water retention and flux.^[8]\n\n\nAlso notice how important hydration (i.e. water content) in our epidermis, specifically in stratum corneum. \n\nHold on, I'm not trying to sound r/imverysmart here. I assure you such information are significant in skincare. As we delve in further, you'll understand why.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo how do you measure skin barrier function? It is through **transepidermal water loss (TEWL)** and water content of the stratum corneum, and **skin surface pH**. TEWL and water content are evidently inversely proportional - increased TEWL lowers water content; decreased TEWL more water content. TEWL is the total amount of water vapor loss through skin when there is no sweat gland activity. TEWL is measured by ServoMed Evaporimeter (VERY EXPENSIVE!).^[9-12]\n\nImpaired barrier function has been known to lead in skin conditions and diseases such as xerosis (dryness), rosacea, atopic dermatitis (eczema), and acne vulgaris.^[10,13-15] It has been observed that patients with acne vulgaris have low amount of ceramides due to the diminished water barrier content, measured by TEWL. AV patients have higher sebum production and greater TEWL.^[16]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Oh, okay. Eh 'di ikaw na maraming alam, OP. Bakit hindi mo na lang kami diretsuhin sa acne treatments?!*\n\nAba aba, easyhan mo lang. This is one of my pet peeves. We want to have a healthy skin but we don't really educate ourselves with how our skin works, how  a specific product works - how it really impacts our skin. We just slather a random product on our skin and just hope for the best. Well, that 'best' doesn't come easily. We tend to follow unsolicited advice from people who are blessed with good genes and have a healthy skin to begin with. \n\nAnd if ever there's someone here, reading, who has a clear skin to die for, please stop giving UNSOLICITED advice. You're just bringing more attention to the person that they have problematic skin. Of course they know it, but rubbing it to them that they need to treat it isn't actually helpful at all.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n'Kay, going back. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet me state my side why when someone asks advice from me, I don't advise them to see dermatologist ASAP. Emphasis on ASAP. I don't want to sound like I'm discouraging people to visit dermatologist. \n\n*Insert situation where a patient went to dermatologist because of acne vulgaris*\n\nA dermatologist would surely prescribe acne treatments. These can be topical or oral antibiotics;  oral Vitamin A derivative like Accutane; topical Vitamin A derivatives (also known as retinoids) like Tretinoin, Epiduo, Differin (Adapelene); benzoyl peroxide; salycilic acid; azelaic acid; and many more. ~~(YOU SEE, THERE ARE MANY TREATMENTS AVAILABLE AND YET WE STILL SUFFER FROM AV)~~. They would also insist you to use their products or prescribe OTC products, having a basic routine to support a treatment they chose for you.\n\nBy then, the patient already have a simple routine of cleanser, (toner), moisturizer, (and sunscreen) + maybe a topical treatment like Epiduo. The dermatologist advised the patient to use all of these consistently. \n\nProblems? MANY. First, there's no guarantee that the basic routine of cleanser, moisturizer, etc will work for your skin. Why? You can be sensitive to certain ingredient/s present on them, thus leading to *acne cosmetica* (breakouts from cosmetic products). Second, how the hell will you know if it's the cleanser, the toner, or the moisturizer that's causing the problem if you introduced them all at once? Third, treatments like Epiduo encourage faster skin cells turnover rate which can lead to *purging* (surfacing clogged pores A.K.A. it's gonna get worse before it gets better), how will you know if those added acne are due to purging and not acne cosmetica?\n\n\nFourth, these treatments can compromise our skin barrier. Benzoyl peroxide (BP) can cause irritant dermatitis and can result to TEWL.^[17] Topical retinoids can also cause dermatitis. In fact, there's a term called retinoid dermatitis - erythema (redness), scaling (dryness), and desquamation. ^[18] In short, no matter how powerful these treatments are, they can also worsen your skin concerns.\n\n\nQuoting:\n\n> In addition, certain medications used to treat AV can cause alterations in SC integrity and function, either via the active ingredient, the vehicle, or both, which can result in signs and symptoms of cutaneous irritation. . Providing specific skin care recommendations, including product selection and proper use, is an important part of the management of AV and may adjunctively augment the efficacy of topical medications in reducing acne lesions.^[19]\n\nYes, the patient's derma is right in providing a skin care products to help a treatment. But he's wrong for suggesting to use them all at once.\n\nWe have to keep in mind that a problematic skin has an impaired barrier function present to different conditions as what stated above.^[10,13-15] So damaging the skin barrier further would just worsen everything. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**SO what do you need to do, then? BABY your skin! Moisturize it. Strengthen your SC barrier.** \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut how? By having a dedicated skincare routine! This is what I like with r/AsianBeauty. ABers focus on strengthening their skin barrier rather than treating any skin conditions right away. Try posting once on their daily help thread. \"Hi! I'm new to skincare and I need suggestions to treat my acne.\" They wouldn't say \"Hello! Acids like chemical exfoliants are effective on treating acne, try...\" Their answers would probably be, \"What's your current routine? I suggest having a basic routine first before proceeding with powerful treatments.\"\n\nBecause it makes sense! Having a dedicated skincare routine without treatment is as powerful as focusing on treatment itself.^[20,21]\n\nFun fact: Even a proper skincare routine has been known to be effective in aiding the skin barrier function of infants.^[22,23] ~~I can now foresee what would be the first product I would buy for my son/daughter - a moisturizer! Haha, kidding.~~ \n\nBelieve me, when I started having a routine of cleanser + moisturizer + sunscreen every day, the number of my acne reduced significantly. But of course I reached the plateau where I needed to incorporate treatments on my routine, because having a solid routine + a powerful treatment would lead you far!^[24-26]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA simple skincare routine shall compose of a gentle cleanser, a moisturizer, a broad-spectrum sunscreen.\n\nBefore we go further to skincare routine let me just provide additional notes to consider.\n\n**YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)**, duh. I know I mentioned this numerous times and will still do. It is important to instill this concept. You shouldn't be surprised that a certain, popular product didn't work for you. Or a product in which some told you to stay away from, worked for you. That's one of the mysteries of this world, Babe. ~~When they said we are created in God's image and likeness, they meant different gods~~. \n\nWe have different sensitivities to ingredients present in a specific product. \n\n>\"People can even be allergic to commonly used products. It’s not that ingredients in these are unsafe – it’s the way the body reacts to them can differ from person to person.\"\nDr Chris Flower, Director-General of CTPA and a Chartered Biologist & Toxicologist^[27]\n\nWhen a product says *hypoallergenic* doesn't guarantee one won't have reaction to it. After all, *hypo* means *less than* so just lesser chance of allergic reaction. \n\nSame goes with *non-comedogenic* (won't clog your pores). This is just one of those marketing strategies to make you buy that product. Okay, I might have gone overboard. That is still a useful guideline 'cause they could mean that the manufacturers tested their products and consider them good fit for people with oily, acne-prone skin. Don't get so worked up with this when you buy products tho. *\"Okay, this one doesn't say non-comedogenic so I might get acne here*\". No, not that mindset. Remember what I said? YMMV. You won't know until you test it out yourself.\n\n[FDA has a list of common claims and labels used in cosmetics](https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/Labeling/default.htm). \n\nThese are:\n\n- \"Alcohol Free\"\n- “Cosmeceutical”\n- \"Cruelty Free\"/\"Not Tested on Animals\"\n- Hypoallergenic\n- Organic\n\nAs you can see, non-comedogenic is not recognized by FDA.\n\nOne reason is the comedogenicity of some ingredients were tested on rabbit ears. NOT ON HUMANS. \n\n[Related reading](https://www.prettycat.uk/single-post/2017/09/12/Comedogenicity-testing--The-Rabbit-Ear-Test)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom time to time, I'm gonna use cosdna.com as a reference to products' ingredients. It's a helpful site for identifying if a specific ingredient is highly comedogenic or an irritant. It does sound contradicting to my previous statement but even [CosDNA said that](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/help/ingredients_qna.php)\n\n> Our data source include[sic] international experts, institutions and publications. If any the three column is blank, this meas[sic] there is no data (not indicate[sic] [whether] the ingredient is safe or unsafe). We want to remind our user, the effect of cosmetics depends on concentration, quality, process and mutual influence of ingredients. The skin condition of each person are[sic] different (even constantly changing).\n\nNevertheless, it still a good site to track ingredients of a particular product. If for example two products broke you out or gave you adverse reactions, you can look and compare the ingredients present on these products, and pinpoint what could be the culprit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat being said, **Don't hesitate to stop using a product that is not working for you.** If it's making things worse, that just means it's not meant for you. \n\n*Ahh maybe this product is just drawing these pimples out.* No, that is *skin purging* and purging, only happens when you're using exfoliants (BHA, AHA,etc), acids, and/or vitamin A topical derivatives which increase skin's cells turnover rate like retinoids. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**SKINCARE IS GENDER-NEUTRAL**\n\nThis is intended specifically to men. Taking care of your skin doesn't make you less masculine. Using at least three facial products won't hurt your manliness. Please stop that ongoing machismo. \n\nThose products labeled *for men* are just marketing bullshits. \n\nI'm not saying that there's no skin difference between men and women. In fact, males have been reported to have larger pore size and higher sebum production.^[28] Even the skin's pH (which will be tackled later) of females are lower compared to males.^[29] Males also have greater skin thickness than females.^[30]. Males also experience more intense pigmentation after sun exposure and retain it for a longer time than females.^[31]. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet's have an example.\n\n*Nivea for men deep cleansing face wash*\n\n[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_e1ce27538.html)\n\n> Aqua, **Cocamidopropyl Betaine**, **Sodium myreth sulfate**, **Decyl Glucoside**, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, **Alcohol Denat**, PEG-90 GLYCERYL ISOSTEARATE, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, Sodium Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyquaternium-10, Laureth-2, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Benzophenone-4, Parfum\n\nIngredients in bold are surfactants and an alcohol. What I have observed from cleansers that are marketed for men is its supposedly \"deep cleansing\" characteristic. This can be seen from these surfactants. I included alcohol because aside from these sulfates, this is also the culprit why it feel like such products *really cleanses* your face. When in reality, it just leaves your face squeaky clean and DRY. \n\nWhat I also observed is the presence of Benzophenone-4, why the hell would you put a sunscreen ingredient in a facial wash?? \n\nNow, knowing that men's skin has larger pores and tends to be more oily, do these ingredients really help with a male skin? Does science view surfactants as ingredients for men? \n\nDon't get me started with the other one - *Sikreto ng mga Gwapo*. ~~Sikreto pero binunyag, h'wag ako~~. Okay, I'm not saying avoid this product and the like. If it works for you, then okay. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnother example:\n\n*Pond's Men Energy Charge All-in-One Moisturizer*\n\nWow what's with these \"men\" products that use \"Energy\" \"Fresh\" \"Sport\", \"Cool\"? To make them more *masculine*? lol\n\n[Ingredients](https://www.ponds.com/ph/men/products/collection/energy-charge/moisturizer.html)\n\n> Water, Dimethicone, Alcohol Denat, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Caprylic/Capri Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Perfume, DMDM Hydantoin, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Propylene Glycol, Stearic Acid, BHT, Menthol, Sodium PCA, Triethanolamine, Niacinamide, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract\n\nAnother thing I observed is that these manufacturers of supposedly \"for men\" products might be inclined to the idea that men prefer putting products that absorb easily, almost feel like nothing has been applied to the skin, have a cooling effect. \n\nThese are evident with *Alcohol Denat* high up in the ingredients list. Alcohol, an astringent, makes the product absorb easily and can be irritating to some. The presence of Menthol, which is another astringent, is just for added fragrance and cooling sensation. And how can these be beneficial to male's skin? \n\nIt's not that this particular moisturizer is not beneficial. Key ingredients such as *Niacinamide* - for skin brightening and sebum regulation, *Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract* - for anti aging and photoaged skin, are also present. The thing is these ingredients are way below the list. Perfume even listed ahead of them, in which sensitive skin peeps should be wary of. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOkay let me stop criticizing these products. The takeaway is - skincare is not sexist! The *for men* label is just a marketing ploy, tricking you into thinking that their products are specially formulated for men. \n\n\n---\n\n\n### A skincare routine that doesn't compromise our SC barrier\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**ON CLEANSERS / FACIAL WASHES**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you're going to visit r/AsianBeauty you might stumbled with the pH level of the cleanser they are using. Apparently, pH level is significant in choosing a cleanser to have a healthy skin barrier. \n\n**The pH (Potential of Hydrogen / Power of Hydrogen)** is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of an aqueous solution.\n\n[For reference](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1fChGF6M8a4/Vxcq2iOIf_I/AAAAAAAAEv8/tqT54xF5wMcwSVVaqHBe8YROCx7wP6EVgCLcB/s1600/640px-216_pH_Scale-01.jpg]). The pH scale ranges from 0-14. The pH of distilled water is 7, this is neutral. Any solution with a pH below 7 is an acid and any solution with a pH above 7 is an alkali (or base).\n\nThe skin itself does not really have a pH. When they talk about the pH of the skin, they are referring to the pH of a very thin, naturally secreted, moist layer caused by normal secretions from sweat glands (sudoriferous glands), sebaceous glands (which secrete an oily substance called sebum), and the breakdown of fatty acids on the skin by good bacteria that live on our skin. Together these secretions create the **Acid Mantle**.\n\nYes, remember that I mentioned that skin's pH surface is one of the measures of skin barrier function?^[12] Well, it's gonna be relevant here!\n\nSkin's surface pH is said to be ranging from 4 to 6. Some papers say anywhere from 4 to 7 pH level. Having an average of 4.7, 5.5.^[32,33] The consensus is that our skin's pH is acidic to slightly/mildly acidic. This pH level helps maintain the strength and cohesiveness of the skin.^[34]\n\nWhy is it important to maintain this level of acidity tho? The formation of barrier lipids is observed to be delayed when the pH level is 7.4 or alkaline in nature.^[35] Hope you still remember the SC barrier's mortar.^[8] Lipid formation and metabolism require an acidic pH; alterations contribute to the SC barrier's integrity which may lead to different skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (Eczema), irritant contact dermatitis, ichthyosis, acne vulgaris, and Candida albicans infection.^[36]\n\nAlso, maintaining the skin's acidity doesn't disrupt the bacterial flora's (good bacteria) colonization, present on our skin. Whereas, reaching an alkaline pH promotes the dispersal of these bacteria.^[37] One example is the growth of  Propionibacterium acnes (P Acnes), a commensal bacterium found naturally on our skin, which is also one of the causes of acne vulgaris. P Acnes grow much better in an acidic environment, reaching alkaline pH can increase the number of P Acnes.^[38] Aside from these, alkaline pH skin can show severe irritation to ingredients such as sodium lauryl sulfate (a harsh detergent that we will talk about later).^[39]\n\nIt has also been observed that patients with acne vulgaris tend to have a higher skin pH in comparison to those who a normal skin. Majority of acne occurences are related to high skin pH. Further increase of this pH mirrors a state of SC instability.^[40]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nWhat increases our skin's pH? There are certain factors for that. Endogenous factors include: Skin moisture, sweat, sebum, anatomic site, genetic predisposition, race, age, atopic skin disease. Exogenous factors include: Soaps, detergents, cosmetic products, occlusive dressings, skin irritants, and topical antibiotics.^[41] We'll focus on the latter, with cleansers being the most significant. \n\nThe use of high pH cleansers can disrupt the acid mantle by increasing its acidic pH.^[37,40] A study showed that using an acidic cleanser reduced the number of acne and caused little irritation to acne-prone patients, as oppose to the group who used a soap bar (with a relatively high pH) - number of acne increased.^[42] \n\nIdeally, cleansers should have a pH of around 5.5.^[43] Avoid using soap bars, not only because almost all of them are alkaline (high pH)^[44] , they are also harsh and bring greatest changes to the barrier. Opt for liquid facial cleansers instead.^[45] \n\nEver wondered why some of feminine washes are formulated with acidic pH? (i.e. pH Care). ;)\n\nHow about the recently hyped Aztec Healing Clay Mask? Why is it combined with Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV)? Aztec's main ingredient is calcium bentonite clay which has a whooping pH level of 8 to 9.7! ACV has a pH level 3 to 5 - a perfect pH-neutralizer to bring down the bentonite clay's pH to an optimum skin pH level. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**You might want to avoid cleansers with SLS**\n\nProbably the most common surfuctant is *sodium lauryl sulfate* (SLS) also known as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). It is one of the cheap foaming agents commonly found on soaps, shampoos, toothpaste, etc. It is responsible for the foam or the rich lather you notice when you use such products.^[46]\n\nSurfuctants can penetrate into skin and compromise SC barrier function.^[47] SLS, among other surfuctants, can increase the SC's TEWL and can cause inflammation.^[48,49] Ceramides, one of the skin's lipids^[8], has been observed to decrease when skin is in contact with SLS.^[50] \n\nIt is also listed by [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/ebc959348.html), having a comedogenic rating of 5. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo TL;DR just choose a cleanser that is low pH and doesn't contain SLS then? NOT REALLY but IDEALLY yes. What I meant is there's a reason why some have nice skin despite using cleansers with high pH.  It's just that if you can avoid the drawbacks, then why not? But then again YMMV.\n\nBUT if semantics aside, what you really need to consider is to make sure you're using a **GENTLE** cleanser. Your skin shouldn't feel tight after cleansing. Not drying. Not that \"squeaky clean\" feeling as what others coin.  Just because you're oily, you're gonna tolerate that. No. Remember that I mentioned that sebum is one of the components of acid mantle? That squeaky clean feeling is removing this fatty layer which is important part of skin's natural protection, and stripping natural oils instead of excess oils.\n\nAvoid overwashing, too. Cleanse for a maximum of two times only. Some even like to just splash plain water in the morning. I know it's tempting to wash your face, especially for oily skin, but that's just a temporary fix. After a few minutes, you'll notice that oils will start to build up again. You might even get *acne detergicans* from overwashing. If it bothers you that much, I recommend having an oil face blotter instead which only removes excess oils. [Like this one from Clean & Clear](https://www.cleanandclear.com/blotting-papers/clean-clear-oil-absorbing-sheets)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm gonna list some IDEAL facial washes you can choose from. If I missed other ones, especially LOCAL cleansers or easily available, please do comment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Human Heart Nature] Facial Washes**\n\n[Months ago, I asked Human Heart Nature through their page the pH levels of their various cleansers](https://imgur.com/a/DPcKZ). They were pretty responsive. Listing them down.\n\n- [Nourishing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/nourishing-facial-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.50 to 5.2\n- [Hydrating Creamy Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/hydrating-creamy-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Balancing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/balancing-facial-wash.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Acne Defense Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/acne-defense-facial-wash-100ml.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 5.0\n\nPersonally,I prefer the Nourishing Facial Wash. It does what a cleanser should do - gentle cleansing. You might ask why not the Acne Defense Facial Wash since I have oily acne-prone skin type? My understanding is cleanser should only cleanse not treat your acne with acne-fighting ingredients. It's because cleanser is not meant to stay on our skin for a few minutes, thus such ingredients would not really contribute to acne. But if it works for some, go! If you want to try these facial washes, each of these has a small variant for a cheap price. Perfect for testing before committing to full sized bottles. \n\nKeep in mind that the surfuctants on these cleansers are not strong and little to no emulsifier present, thus you *might* not notice a rich foam or lather but that doesn't mean it's not doing it's job. Don't use a huge blob just to force a lather. These are also not fragrance-free. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Celeteque Dermoscience] Hydration Facial Wash](https://www.unilab.com.ph/products/celeteque-dermoscience-hydration-facial-wash/)**\n\nQuoting the product's description:\n> It has mild cleansing agents and a special combination of moisturizers that gently yet effectively clean without drying your skin.\n\nAnd according to one redditor who used digital pH meter to test the pH level of different cleansers, this one has a pH of 5.5! [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/63jk7a/psa_ph_levels_of_various_cleansers/)\n\nHas SLES - a milder version of SLS. I do like this one tho even my mom and my lil sis. Fragrance-free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Sebamed] Facial Cleansers**\n\nHas two variants: \n\n- [for oily and combination skin](http://www.sebamed.com/products/product-page/?tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bproduct%5D=124&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Baction%5D=show&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Product&cHash=33d05c27ea2ee6871e84e36fdd0a39e4)\n> Soap-free facial cleanser with the pH value of 5.5 of healthy skin to remove excess sebum and aid the skin achieving lipid balance of oily and combination skin\n\n- [for normal to dry skin](http://www.sebamed.com/products/product-page/?tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bproduct%5D=125&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Baction%5D=show&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Product&cHash=62e9f9649f6166184bb8da0635908ac3)\n> Soap-free facial cleanser with the pH value of 5.5 of healthy skin to support and maintain the moisture and lipid balance of normal to dry skin\n\nThe cleansers look promising. I haven't tried them out tho.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Belo Essentials] Facial Washes](http://beloessentials.ph/product)**\n\n- *Pore Minimizing Facial Wash*\n\n> For smooth and radiant complexion, start with Belo Essentials Pore Minimizing Face Wash that tightens pores and whitens your skin in just 7 days! This soap-free, gentle cleanser contains Glutathione, Kojic Acid, and Gigawhite to whiten and skin vitamins to moisturize, revitalizing your skin with a radiant glow. Expertly formulated for oily skin.\n\nIt has a pH level of 5.3.\n\n- *Skin Hydrating Facial Wash*\n\n> Your first step to whiter skin, Belo Essentials Skin Hydrating Face Wash deeply cleanses without over-drying and whitens your skin in just 7 days! This soap-free, nourishing cleanser is infused with Glutathione, Kojic Acid, and Gigawhite to whiten and skin vitamins to moisturize, revealing clearer and whiter skin. Expertly formulated for normal to dry skin.\n\nIt has a pH level of 5.4.\n\nPersonal thoughts: The \"whitens your skin in just 7 days\" seems bogus. You can't just \"whiten\" your skin for that span. And expecting that from a cleanser? Nah. Anyway, if you're looking for a cleanser that's no-frills, these are not for you. They have tons of ingredients present.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**[[Safeguard] Derma Sense Facial Cleanser Sensitive Variant](http://www.sampleroom.ph/safeguard-derma-sense-gently-cleanses-facial-cleanser-acne-prone-skin)**\n\n> gently cleanses easily irritable skin with its mild, unscented formula. It removes dirt, impurities and excess oil, while maintaining your skin's natural layer. Dermatologically tested, DERMA SENSE brings professional care right to you\n\nAlso pH-balanced. I freaking want to try this one because it's well loved by fellow redditors here, but it's always out of stock! Yes, if a product is labeled for sensitive skin, I always prefer it because of their clean ingredients list (no fragrance, additives,etc), so less chance of breaking me out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Himalaya] Purifying Neem Face Wash](http://www.himalayaherbals.com/products/skincare/Purifying-Neem-Face-Wash.htm)**\n\n> Specially formulated to give you clear, problem free skin, a soap-free, daily use face wash gel that cleanses your skin by removing excess oil and impurities without over-drying. Neem, well-known for its purifying and antibacterial properties, kills problem-causing bacteria. Combined with Turmeric, it helps control acne and pimples leaving your skin soft, clear, refreshed and problem-free.\n\nAccording to some redditors it has a pH level of 5.5.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Cetaphil] Gentle Skin Cleanser](https://www.cetaphil.com/gentle-skin-cleanser)**\n\n> a mild, non-irritating formulation that soothes skin as it cleans. In fact, it's gentle enough for a baby's delicate skin. Designed specifically to work for all skin types, it is a simple, yet highly effective way to care for your skin.\n\nThis one has SLS. But my best friend uses this one and she really likes it! She said it's like putting a lotion on her face. Unfortunately, this broke me out. I can't handle SLS. It is also popular on r/AB and r/SCA. \n\n[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_7019242376.html)\n\nIf you can tolerate SLS, this is a perfect cleanser for you. Very short ingredients list. But I've read somewhere this has a pH of around 6.7. Not alkaline so it's kinda good nevertheless.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**ON MOISTURIZERS**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is probably the most vital part of skincare. Moisturizers can help with our SC barrier function if proper ingredients are used. From TEWL reduction, skin lipids' restoration, and other skin rejuvenation benefits.^[51]\n\nAll skin types need moisturizer. Yes, that is contrary to the popular belief that oily skin doesn't need moisturizer. You just need to find a moisturizer that will suit your needs. I presume you already know what your skin type is. If still not, I suggest reading this **[informative post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4kufkk/skin_basics_181_skin_types_setting_standards/)** \n\n**Skin types** vary in different measures but the most common would be: Normal (please step out, jk), Oily, Dry, Combination, and Sensitive. ([Paula's Choice recognizes that everyone has sensitive skin](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/basic-skin-care-tips/what-is-my-skin-type.html)).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere are different types/components/classes/properties of moisturizers. These are humectants, emolients, occlusives, and constituents of natural moisturizing factor/essential proteins.^[52,53] \n\n**Humectants**, as mentioned earlier,^[6] attract water from two sources - from the dermis into the epidermis and in humid conditions from the environment. In short, they are responsible for hydration! However, humectants are a double-edged sword. They increase TEWL too by enhancing water absorption from the dermis into the epidermis where it is easily lost to the environment.^[53] In simplest words, because humectans increased the water content, the skin now have enough water so the rest just evaporates! For this reason, humectants are best combined with occlusives.\n\n**[Some ingredients that act as a humectant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4885180/table/T3/)**:^[54,55]\n\n- *Glycerol/Glycerin*\n\nThis is the most common humectant. In fact, it is the second most frequently used cosmetic ingredient, next to water, documented through the FDA’s Voluntary Cosmetic Reporting Program.^[56] Glycerin is a skin-replenishing and restoring ingredient, meaning it is a substance found naturally in skin, helping to establish normal balance and hydration.^[57] \n\n- *Hyaluronic Acid (HA) or hyaluronan/Sodium Hyaluronate*\n\nThey are not actually the same. Sodium Hyaluronate is derived from Hyaluronic Acid but they still function the same.^[58] It is also present on our body and most abundant in our skin, which accounts for 50% of our body’s total HA level.^[59,60] It can hold 1000 times its water weight!^[61] This makes it a superstar ingredient in skin's hydration and even in skin aging.^[62-64]\n\n- *Propylene Glycol(PG) and Butylene Glycol (BG)*\n\nI've been seeing these ingredients mostly from sheet masks, which is pretty logical. PG and BG, not only a humectant, but can also act as an enhancer. They help active ingredients penetrate the skin.^[65,66] So from a few minutes a sheet mask stayed from your face, the ingredients present penetrated better on your skin; thus faster result (i.e. brightening). There are also studies concerning that PG is skin-sentisizing (can cause adverse reactions from repeated exposure).^[67-69] But the consensus seemed to be PG is safe to use in cosmetics.^[65] If anything, PG should be used in low concentrations^[69] just like other humectants.^[55]\n\n- *Panthenol (Vitamin B5)*\n\nPanthenol, in long-term use, significantly improved the moisture level and decreased TEWL of the skin.^[70,71] It is incredibly useful in wound healing, too.^[72]\n\n- *Urea*\n\n*Insert biased praises in this ingredient.* I just recently discovered this ingredient and I'm already in love. Urea? EWW. Don't worry it's a different urea when used in cosmetics. We are talking about hydroxyethyl urea. As you've read earlier, Urea is one of the natural moisturizing factors present in our skin.^[7]\n\nApparently, Urea is a well-known ingredient in treating xerosis (dry skin).^[73-75] As it turns out, it can also be beneficial to other skin types! Who said only dry skin needs that hydration?\nUrea, like other humectants, can increase the hydration and water-binding capacity of the horny layer.^[76,77] It reduces TEWL and the irritant reactions when skin is exposed to SLS.^[78,79] \n\nThis sexy ingredient has also been observed to have a keratolytic property!^[80,81] **Keratolytic** means the agent that assists keratolysis - \"the softening and shedding of the horny outer layer of the skin\".^[82] In other words, it helps with the desquamation of keratinocytes in the SC or corneocytes; or in more simpler term: *exfoliation*. Fear not, it gently exfoliates compare to active chemical exfoliants. The fun doesn't stop as Urea can also enhance the penetration of other topical ingredients.^[81,83,84]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Occlusives** sit on the skin, creating a physical barrier, blocking the TEWL in the SC. This is the reason why humectants are paired with occlusives. The former draws water onto the skin, while the latter traps this water. The most popular occlusive ingredient is **petrolatum** or petroleum jelly. At a minimum concentration of 5%, it can reduce TEWL by more than 98%!^^[54] \n\nBut you all know how greasy a petroleum jelly is, right? Petroleum Jelly (Vaseline), was previously labeled as highly comedogenic after testing on rabbit's ear. But this has been busted by a study that tested it on acne-prone patients. They concluded that greasiness doesn't equate with comedogenicity! \"The admonition for acne patients to seek \"oil-free\" skin care products has no scientific merit with regard to comedogenicity.\"^^[85] If a product is making you oily because of its nature, doesn't make it highly comedogenic.  But of course -.  There was also an issue that occlusives futher impair barrier function but it has been proven that occlusives, like petrolatum, even accelerated barrier recovery.^[86] I can attest to that. Petroleum jelly really helped when I overexfoliated my skin.\n\nBecause of aesthetic reasons, lighter occlusives came into picture like **lanolin, mineral oil**, and **silicones** which only reduce TEWL by 20–30%.^[54]\n\nJust look at how our fellow redditors are fond of occlusives A.K.A. **S L U G  L I F E**\n\n[I didn't choose the Slug life, the Slug life chose me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/73t814/humor_i_didnt_choose_the_slug_life_the_slug_life/.)\n\n[To all the slugs out there, you win](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7xe07s/personal_to_all_the_slugs_out_there_you_win/)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Emolients** fill the gap between the layered corneocytes, smoothing the skin. This is the sticky feeling you notice on your moisturizer. \n\n\n---\n\n**[References used:](https://docdro.id/0zJ9xzb.)**\n\nEdit: I have to divide this into parts cause of characters restriction.",

The rest of the arm is perfectly clean of cosmetics (but full of white dust! 😂). I didn't have any AB sunscreen at the moment but I was thinking of trying foundation with SPF and maybe a before/after in the evening... How much sunscreen stays on my body after X hours?\n\nThe lamp I used, I bought many years ago. I am not able to tell which wavelenght it produces (/u/katherine-the-wild can you help?).  \n\nPhone: iPhone SE\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n>Avéne Lait enfant 50+ INCI: *Avene thermal spring water (avene aqua), C12-15 alkyl benzoate, dicaprylyl carbonate, methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol, water (aqua), glycerin, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol, methoxyphenl triazine, diethylhexyl butamido, triazone, diisopropyl adipate, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, cetearyl isononanoate, lauryl glucoside, polyglyceryl-2, dipolyhydroxystearate, decyl glucoside, benzoic acid, caprylic/capric triglyceride, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, disodium EDTA, glyceryl behenate, glyceryl dibehenate, hydrogenated palm glycerides, hydrogenated palm kernel glycerides, polyacrylate-13, polyisobutene, polysorbate 20, propylene glycol, sorbitan, isostearate, tocopherol, tocopheryl glucoside tribehenin, xanthan gum.* \n\n>Avéne Sunsimed INCI: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene Aqua), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Nano), Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzoic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopheryl Glucoside, Excipients* (being a medical device I wasn't able to find a complete list of ingredients).  \n\n\nEDIT: Sorry but I wasn't comfortable sharing pictures of my face. But the sunscreen showed up reeeally well and I could see all of the spots I missed. I also could see all the sun damage and hyperpigmentation that isn't visible under regular lights. 😭   \nIf anyone else has a blacklight available and could test it with other sunscreens, I would be very curious to see the results! Thanks everyone!",

It might have to do with applying a higher concentration to the swatch than you normally would to your face, and because it’s easier to get even coverage on a small, flat surface than in all little contours of your face. I also found that it only really works with physical sunscreens. The black light is looking for the white pigment in titanium dioxide and zinc oxide to bounce off of, so it works best with physical sunscreens, not as well with combo sunscreens, and almost not at all with chemical sunscreens.",

    "body": "**Background**  \n\nIn August my favorite shampoo, Hask Argan Oil Repairing Shampoo, got reformulated with ingredients I'm allergic to, so I decided it was high time to try out some AB shampoos.  One of the things I really liked about the Hask shampoo was that it cleansed thoroughly but gently, so I knew I wanted a shampoo that shared some (if not all) of the same surfactants as they can make a huge difference in the harshness of the shampoo.  I also wanted a sulfate/silicone free shampoo that had a few oils like the Hask shampoo as well.  After many nights scouring cosdna for ingredients lists, I settled on Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo.  \n\n**Product Claims/Ingredients**  \n\nMoist Diane's [website](http://www.moist-diane.jp/en/products/extra-damage.html) claims the purpose of this line is to \"restore extremely damaged hair ends and roughness\", as well as repairing hair damage when heat is applied due to the line's unique \"nano repair matrix\".  I don't heat treat my hair, nor is it permed, bleached, etc so I wasn't really drawn in by these claims. \n\nMy main draw was the [ingredients list](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_63e4326873.html):\n\n>Water, **Olefin (C14-16) sodium sulphonate**, **Cocamidopropyl betaine**, **Cocamidomethyl MEA**, Cocoyl glutamic acid TEA, Potassium cocoyl hydrolyzed keratin, PEG-7 glyceryl cocoate, Myristamine oxide, Sodium cocoamphoacetate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Gamma-docosalactone, Quaternium-18, Quaternium-33, **Cholesterol**, **Ceramide EOP**, **Ceramide NG**, **Ceramide NP**, **Ceramide AG**, **Ceramide AP**, Propylene glycol, Hydrolyzed keratin, **Argania spinosa kernel oil**, Mango seed oil, Theobroma grandiflorum seed butter, Prune seed extract, Carapa guaianensis seed oil, Sclerocarya birrea seed oil, **Baobab seed oil**, Opuntia Ficus-Indica seed oil, Steardimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed keratin, Pouteria sapota seed oil, Keratin, Isostearoyl hydrolyzed keratin, Alanine, Hydroxyproline, Sodium-PCA, Cetearamidoethyl diethonium hydrolyzed rice protein, **Sodium Hyaluronate**, Hydroxypropyltrimonium hyaluronate, **Hydrolyzed hyaluronate**, **Hydrolyzed honey protein**, Malus domestica fruit cell culture extract, Argania spinosa sprout cell extract, Rhododendron ferrugineum leaf cell culture extract, **Collagen**, Hydrolyzed conchiolin, Bis-ethoxydiglycol cyclohexane 1,4-dicarboxylate, Propanediol, Dipropylene glycol, Butylene glycol, Isomalt, Polyquaternium-10, Isononyl isononanoate, Soybean sterols, Sodium chloride, Xanthan gum, Lecithin, Behentrimonium chloride, Glycerin, Citric acid, **Lactic acid**, Tocopherol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Aroma, Caramel \n\nBold indicates ingredients that my face likes or surfactants that are the same (or very similar) to the Hask shampoo.  Wow.  Five ceramides plus cholesterol, some nice oils (including baobab!!!), and some HA and collagen thrown in?  Yeah.  I like it.  \n\n**Performance**\n\nThis shampoo is a dream.  It lathers richly, which feels great, and it also has a mild fragrance (generic bubble bath scent) that is noticeable while using it but fades very quickly.  It comes in a large pump bottle, which is genius for shampoo and so much easier than fiddling with a squeeze tube.\n\nI have a naturally oily scalp that needs daily washing.  My scalp gets flaky if I use a shampoo that's too harsh, or if it gets super dry in the winter.  I've had no problems with flakiness since starting this shampoo and my scalp overall feels more hydrated and strong.  My hair also feels stronger and is glossier than it has been in a while.  I used to use Hask's argan oil hair mask 2-3x weekly, but I haven't felt the need to do so since starting this shampoo. \n\nI've also used this as a body wash since I ran out a month ago and thought why not share the goodness of this shampoo with all of my body skin. My skin is hydrated and appreciates the extra pampering.  \n\nFor curiosity's sake, I tested the pH with my aquarium drop test kit.  It's a narrow range test kit so it only shows 6.0 to 7.5, with anything below or above those values showing as a 6 or 7.5 respectively.  However, I'm not going to use anything above a 6.5 so it works for my purposes.  Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo comes in at a 6.0 or below, which is awesome so I'm considering testing it on my face because YOLO.\n\n**Verdict**\n\nI have been using this shampoo daily since September and I will continue using it for my hair and body until they reformulate it or discontinue it. **HG**\n\n**Where to find it**\n\nI bought mine off Amazon prime for $15, although it's no longer available on Prime.  You can also find it and the refill pouches for a similar price on Ebay or Amazon Japan. Edit: and Dokodemo",

Easily congested.\nI have PIE and redness, but I don't have much dark spots or discoloration (aside from what's left behind after eczema flared ups) \n\nAlso I live in a dry, hot climate where the sun is really harsh.\n\n\n📈 **About the charts (slide 2 and 3)**:\n\n\n0 means least of the \"title\" and 5 means most of the \"title\"; like \"thickness\" is rated 1 means it's not a thick toner, and is really watery.\n\n\n🧴 **Coming to the product:**\n\n\n- Name: Skin1004 madagascar centella tone brightening boosting toner.\n\n- Period of usage: 1 month\n\n\n- I use it in the morning in this routine:\nCleanse (Benzoyl peroxide cleanser) > Toner 1 (isntree green tea fresh toner) > Toner 2 (this skin1004 toner) > Moisturise > Sunscreen\n\n\n> Ingredients: Centella Asiatica Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Propanediol, Betaine, Allantoin, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Prunus Mume Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Fruit Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Water, Glucose, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n- Fungal acne safe: YES ✅\n\n\n💭 **My thoughts:**\n\n\nWhen I first saw the product the ingredients list looked promising, but i couldn't find much on reddit about it. I use skinsort a lot though (it's an app where you can check whether a product is fungal acne safe or not) and I looked up this product there and the reviews were really good so I ended up ordering it!\n\n\nThis did not disappoint! I think you can get a fair idea of how I feel about the products through the charts that I have attached, but it's really good and it suits my skin well. It's hydrating, soothing, quick absorbing and it works. Also, it mildly exfoliates the skin but it's not too much and in my opinion it's safe for everyday use! \n\n\nI have used skin1004's tone brightening ampoule too, and I like it but I like this toner WAY more than that ampoule, and in my opinion it works better than the ampoule. Plus if you look up the ampoule on reddit many people have said it broke them out, and I suspect the ampoule was breaking me out too, but I didn't have any such issue with this toner.\n\n\nOverall, I would rate it 4.5/5, will keep repurchasing it. Also, i can tell this will last a while because I have been using it almost everyday, and I layer it twice, but I've only used up the amount you see in the picture so 👀\n",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea?

    "body": "I have **combination skin with an oily T-zone and dry acne prone cheeks laden with PIH**, an aftermath of 2020 and some wrong skincare choices. Since I am acne prone, I try to avoid perfume/fragrance, alcohol and essential oils in my products. \n\n*Processing img thx4k3izjnf61...*\n\nI have tried a bunch of sunscreens and these are the **best ones** I have settled on after a long 2 years of trial and error and time/money/effort invested. I have tried to include the swatches of all the four sunscreens and the white cast whereever it was possible (suncros) for the camera to capture. Lets begin.\n\nProduct Name: **Suncros Soft Matte Finish Gel, SPF 50, PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rave\n\nAvailability in India: Easily Available in India, offline and online.\n\nIngredient list: Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\nSunscreen type: Physical / Mineral \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3zgtf9w6knf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0796b78286edcc7126df7421f34ae34c3ae1c7c8\n\nExperience & opinion: I have been using this sunscreen since almost one year. I used to use UV Doux before this for as long as I can remember, but had to stop using it as my skin got really sensitive and I had damaged my skin barrier. \n\nYou definitely cannot use the recommended two fingers of sunscreen with this one as it gets really heavy and suffocating. I tried layering it in small amounts (maybe just one fingertip at a time), let that settle and then apply another fingertip. I could only do two fingertips with this one. It did work for my extremely sensitive skin at that time and miraculously it was even calming and healing for my active acne and the PIH post acne was really minimal. The texture is in between a cream and a gel as can be seen in the picture. I totally understand why people detest it so much, the heavy suffocating feeling is a put off. I am not going to lie, it is heavy, feels like a suffocating layer on your face and is uncomfortable but you get used to the feeling once you see that its actually working for your extremely sensitive skin when nothing else does. You have to properly blend it in, take a minute or two to actually spread it on the skin. I have tried to photograph the white cast this one gives immediately post application. but once it settles in 30 minutes or so, the white cast is almost negligible and gives a primer finish (I am NC 43-45 for reference). I don't use makeup so I don't know how it would perform under makeup. The reapplication is difficult. I blot my face a lil before I apply this and again it takes a while to settle which is irritating if you are out and about. I could never reapply this more than once. It is sweat proof, tested it in peak of summer. This is the only zinc oxide based sunscreen that did not dry out my cheeks. \n\nAll said and done, I can't seem to make it work as my stand alone sunscreen as two fingertip amount is just not going to cut it when you are on all sorts of actives. Hence, since I have healed my skin barrier now and can use chemical sunscreens again, I use it over my cheeks (an area where my PIH is the worst) layered over my chemical sunscreen, after it completely dries. It's the perfect sweet spot for me and helps with PIH.\n\nRepurchase Status: Holy Grail (HG). Already repurchased twice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **Bello Photostable Emugel Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rave ❤\n\nAvailability in India: Easily available offline and online.\n\nIngredient list:\n\nKey Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol, Ethylhexyltriazone Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyltriazine, Diethyl amino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate.\n\nOther ingredients: Purified water, Dimethicone and Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl phosphate, Ceteth-10 phosphate, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Myristyl Myristate, Octyldodecanol, Caprylic Triglyceride, Pentaerythirtyl distearate, Phenyl trimethicone, Vitamin E acetate, Carbomer copolymer, Disodium Edetate, Trolamine, Sodium polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Methyparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben, Isobutylparaben\n\nSunscreen type: Chemical\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dr24pvoaknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f726d323339bee404855990ab043e2a3b051acc2\n\nExperience & opinion: I have been using it everyday since approximately 4 months. The texture is creamy and you have to work it in for like 2 minutes into the skin. Immediately post-application, the sunscreen feels greasy to touch and looks oily but it gets absorbed into the skin in about 10 minutes and leaves a dewy finish which never goes away. I really like the dewy healthy glow it gives me. I can actually use 2 finger amount of sunscreen and it doesn't leave a white cast on my dark skin tone. If it gets into your eyes, it does sting. I can assume that dry skinned people would loooooove this in the winters. If you are combination or oily, I feel you can completely skip the moisturiser step when using this in summers. Would be perfect for inclusion in a minimal routine in the AM. On reapplication, it does leave a little bit of white cast on the sides of the face where we tend to have the peach-fuzz which will go away with a little bit of rubbing. Overall, this is the best budget sunscreen easily available in India which doesn't make us look like we have dressed up for a meme.\n\nRepurchase Status: HG, WRP. Already repurchased thrice. I will be trying out Photostable Gold SPF 55 in the summer, maybe it will replace this one. If not, I will always come back to this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **Biore UV Smooth Kids Milk Spf 50 PA++++**\n\nReview Type: Rave ❤\n\nAvailability in India: Availability is a serious issue. Used to get it from Dokodemo pre-pandemic. Haven't been able to source since.\n\nIngredient list: Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Glyceryl Behenate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Distearate, Sodium Acrylate/​Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Paraffin, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Ceresin, Isohexadecane, Arginine, Lauryl Methacrylate/​Sodium Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polysorbate 80, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Dextrin Palmitate, Agar, Petrolatum, Succinic Acid, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, BHT.\n\nSunscreen type: Chemical\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gjsnx8acknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e3e74e3ba70e6471b63c4d83bd3d41c2e876eab\n\nExperience & opinion: I had been using it everyday in dry summer days. Where I live is not very humid and that's why I think this one works so well for me. The texture is very aptly described as milk since it feels like a thick emulsion and spreads into nothingness into the skin. I can use the recommended amount of sunscreen with this one and it doesn't leave a white cast at all. It gets absorbed into the skin within 2 minutes and leaves behind a comfortable breathable layer of moisture on your skin. It does not dry down matte. It doesn't irritate my eyes. Its just so perfect for my combination skin even on my oily T-zone in peak summer days.  Reapplication is such a breeze. I have reapplied it in a taxi, in my office, before a meeting without any downtime. I just absolutely love everything about this sunscreen except that I think it has been discontinued and I am crying over the loss of my only true HG sunscreen. If anyone from Biore is reading this, please accept my plea and bring this back into production!!!!!\n\nRepurchase Status: HG forever. Although on the look out yet again for something that would match this one's status!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **The Blessing Tree Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50 PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rant\n\nAvailability in India: Available on Amazon.\n\nIngredient list: \n\nKey Ingredients: Octyl Methoxy Cinnamate, Oxybenzone, Titanium Dioxide, Octocrylene, Avobenzone, Zinc Oxide.\n\nOther ingredients: Aqua, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Diisopropyl Adipate, 1, 3, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Acrylates /​ C10-30 Alkyl Acrylare Cross Polymer, Propanediol, Diethylhexyl Sryngylidene Melonate, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Xylitylglucoside (and) Anhydroxylitol (and) Xylitol, Niacinamide, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyl Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Perfume.  That was a task to type!!!!!\n\nSunscreen type: Hybrid\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/52ec0gwdknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8dd848f71d4a3939aa1b3ea6f13df4428170a9b\n\nExperience & opinion: I have had this for around 1 1/2 years now. But I never had the courage to put it on my face due to the infamous \"perfume\" in the inci list as I had a compromised barrier and could tolerate only physical sunscreens. All said and done, this has served well as an excellent body sunscreen which doesn't break the bank and provides me excellent protection. It is non-greasy unlike the other body sunscreens on the market. The white cast disappears within 5-10 minutes and you are good to get dressed and head out of the house. I apply it on all the exposed areas of my body - neck, upper shoulders, arms, hands (I don't feel guilty reapplying it even with the frequent hand washing as its relatively affordable + acts as a moisturiser for me) and feet. \n\nHowever for the sake of this review, I mustered all the courage I had to try it on the face but alas it did not suit me and caused me CC's by evening. It spreads well, leaves a white cast on skin which disappears in about 5-10 minutes, although the white residue along the hairline just doesn't disappear. I had to rub it excessively, almost rubbed it out to get it out of my peach fuzz! The finish on this sunscreen is not ultra matte and nor is it dewy to touch, its almost in between which is comfortable for combination and oily skin types. I was worried that this might get drying on my cheeks as the day progressed due to the zinc oxide content but it did not get dried at all. While I was typing the inci list, I realised it has Niacinamide in it!!! Yet another amazing ingredient to be present in this sunscreen. All in all, I would say if you don't have sensitive/sensitized skin and are okay with the \"O\" sunscreen filters, this is an excellent sunscreen.  \n\nRepurchase Status: Might repurchase for body. Not suitable for my face.\n\nThis review took me almost a month to write and photograph, but I am ultimately happy with the final write-up. I sincerely hope you enjoy reading this! I have tried to include everything based on the rules of this sub, but still if you have any questions, do hit me up.\n\nI will make another post of the sunscreens which didn't work for me and would include the likes of Cipla Rivela tint sunscreen, Hada Labo UV Perfect Gel, Skin Aqua UV Moisture Gel, Photostable Insta,  Aroma Magic Mineral Sunscreen and The Mom's Co. Mineral Based Sunscreen.",

However, I didn't get along with tamanu oil in the past (this serum contains 10%) so I'd hesitate to purchase this without trying it out first. \n\nOn a superficial level I love the pump bottle + the aesthetics and the fact that it's 40ml. And Krave Beauty will also donate 2% of every sale of the GBR serum to a foundation that protects the Great Barrier Reef here in Australia! Overall I'm really interested to read the reviews for this product :)\n\n*Edit: percentages and COSDNA link*\n\n*Edit 2: here’s the YouTube video introducing the product (https://youtu.be/q_HcZm9OjJ8). It has a few before and after pics towards the end*",

It also seems weird to me that there would be lactic acid in this, as it can be bad for some with sensitive skin (which you’d think this product would want to be totally safe for) and according to the Simple Skincare Science post on repairing your barrier ( https://simpleskincarescience.com/dehydrated-skin-moisture-barrier-acne-fix/ ) would want to avoid all chemical exfoliants for a month at least while you are letting it repair and before you start to add a chemical exfoliants back in. So it’s odd to me that this would have lactic acid in it, instead of just being a super repairing moisturizer that anyone can use no matter what other actives they already use. I am on a Curology script for Tret and I’d be wary of over exfoliating with this as it has the lactic acid in it, but if it didn’t I’d love to be able to use a super moisturizing and barrier strengthening product after my Tret! 🤔",

All of these do not have fragrance. Both Isntree creams are great for daytime use (gel cream in the summer and moist cream in the winter). The Illiyoon Ato Lotion is for the body and even face if you prefer a little more occlusivity with a balanced moisture and has been a great all-arounder and extremely economical. Innisfree Ato Cream is a great choice is you really want to lock it all in overnight.***\n\n**My Skin: c-c-c-c-c-COMBO.

It is extremely hydrating, but  in the winter, it really lacks in the 'locking in water' department. I'd say this texture and performance is really similar to the cult-fave Belif Aqua Bomb and is a lot cheaper. It gives a burst of hydration with a hint of moisture, does not have any stickiness, and does not pill with sun protection layer. Has not caused any breakouts for me, but of course, avoid if you have a HA sensitivity or live in dry climate. People with pure oily skin will have more longevity in using this throughout the year. I probably will not repurchase because I love to try new products, but I have enjoyed using it and it practical price. Overall a great no-frills gel-cream.*\n\n***Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Moist Cream:***\n\n* Store: Jolse\n* Price: $10 (sale)\n* Size: 100 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_d36c550998.html) Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Dipropylene Glycol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Betaine, Behenyl Alcohol, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Water, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Cynara Scolymus (Artichoke) Leaf Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Eclipta Prostrata Leaf Extract, Pteris Multifida Extract, Beta-Glucan, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Methylpropanediol, Fructooligosaccharides, Raffinose, Ceramide NP, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Pentaerythrityl Distearate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Cholesterol, Folic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Polyquaternium-51, Tromethamine, Ammonium-Acryloyldimethyltaurate-Vp-Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium EDTA\n* **Review:** *I also used this cream for 6 months, and this is a great daytime cream for the winter. The texture here is more reminescent of Belif Moisturizing Bomb and is even more economical! This cream gives alot of moisture and balances a little bit of hydration and emollience. It takes in a bit more time to rub in and it is slightly sticky after application but that feeling goes away fast especailly when layering with sun protection. I have had zero breakouts using this cream and I recomend this for combination skin that gets drier in the winter. I have also used this at night, but I prefer a little more occlusiveness. It may be good for oily or combo skin at night if you prefer a lighter cream. I probably will not repurchase because I love to try new products, but I have also enjoyed using it and it practical price. Overall a great no-frills moisturizer and I look forward to try other products from Isntree.*\n\n***Illiyoon Ato Ceramide Lotion***\n\n* Store: Olive Young\n* Price: $37 (1+1 deal)\n* Size: 2x 528 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2f20551004.html) Purified Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Shea Butter, Cyclopentasiloxane, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Hydrogenated Poly (C6-14 Olefin), Clohexasiloxane, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Perilla Frutescens Sprout Extract, Magnolia Kobus Flower Extract, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA (Ceramide PC-104 32.75ppm), Mannitol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Caprylate, Dimethicone, Diisostearyl Malate, Lauric Acid, Myristic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Stearic Acid, Silica, Arachidyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Alcohol, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cholesterol, Palmitic Acid, Propanediol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Disodium EDTA\n* **Review:** *I have used this for a month on both my body and my face, and I think out of all of these this is my favorite. I think some may not like that it leaves thin film of occlusiveness, but for me that is a plus. Locking in moisture is critical for me. It truly excels as a body cream because it does not feel sticky. This lotion is filled with so much goodness such as ferments, ginseng (korean antiaging plant), shea butter, and a bit of ceramide. It melts in to your skin and moisturizes it well. In the winter, I also enjoy it as a both a day and night face cream too since it is more emmolient and occlusive than the Isntree HA Moist Cream. Out of all the purchases, this has been a must purchase forever for my body and has an added bonus that I can use it on my face when I want to mix up routine.* \n\n***Innisfree Ato Soothing Cream***\n\n* Store: Jolse \n* Price: $23 (sale)\n* Size: 150 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_bdc7551007.html) Purified Water, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Glycerin, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Panthenol, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, C14-22 Alcohols, Behenyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Bislauramide MEA, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Arachidyl Alcohol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Cholesterol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Xanthan Gum, Sorbitan Isostearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium EDTA, Madecassoside, Glucose, Arachidic Acid, Myristic Acid, Acorus Calamus Extract, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Tocopherol.\n* **Review:** *I have also been using this cream for a month, and it is a very impressive barrier cream. It is buttery and harder to rub in, but this will 100% lock in your routine. Judging by its formulations and comparing to Innisfree Derma Formula Green Tea Probiotics Cream, I can guess that it is about 3% cermamide. This cream does not give much moisturzation, but if you are using a layering a routine it will seal all of the steps in, especially layering an emulsion before it. I feel like with this cream, it has an antiaging effect because my fine lines has redued probably due to its effectiveness as a barrier cream formulated with the ceramide and centella antioxidants! This one will be loved by those with dry, sensitive, or combo skin that loves a good barrier cream. I will probably repurchase, but I know there are other products to try in a similar catagory!*\n\nEdit: Added details addressing fragrance :)",

    "body": "Hello everyone! This is my first time posting here, I hope I'm doing the review correctly. I purchased this product a few months ago in the hopes of clearing up my PIH and so far, I find quite efficacious. \n\n**Skin profile**: Type- Oily, sensitive and prone to acne\nTone- medium (I use Maybelline Fit Me 220)\n**Skin concerns**:hyperpigmentation, acne, clogged pores. \n**Climate and season**:Tropical, summer (very hot and humid) \n**Product**: Hada Labo Shirojyun Premium Whitening Lotion (light) \n**Ingredients**: Water, Glycerin, Methylpropaned Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Diglycerin, Glycera Betaine, Trehalose, PPG-10 Methyl Glucose E Alpha-Arbutin, Chlorphenesin, Polysorbate 20. Hydro Lecithin, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Metabisulfite, Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Ascorbic Acid, Resveratrol \n\n*Review*\n\n**Smell**: It is fragrance-free which is great for my sensitive skin. I can't detect any scent otherwise.\n**Texture**: Quite runny. It absorbs readily into the skin but leaves a very slight sticky feel.\n**Application**: I pour some into my palm, then spread it evenly on my skin, both on my face and body. \n**Length of use**: 3 months\n\nMy skin is recovering from acne, so I'm dealing with PIH and uneven texture. I thought this looks like it would help, seeing as it has niacinamide high up in the ingredient list, which has helped a lot with my hyperpigmentation before. I am quite pleased with the results. It definitely helped to fade my PIH. I had a huge pimple on my thigh which left behind a large purplish-brown spot. I applied the product every night on the spot and the discoloration has faded considerably. It's not completely gone but only 1-2 shades darker than my skin. The lotion also made my skin soft and overall brighter and smoother. \n\n Would definitely repurchase!",

    "body": "**Liquid Gold Review, or: How I learned overexfoliation is a bad thing**\n\n**TL;DR:** If your moisture barrier is damaged, this stuff will seriously change your life. Support an up-and-coming indie shop and repair your moisture barrier, all without breaking your wallet.\n\n**Background:** I recently upped my skincare game considerably through the infinite wisdom and patience of r/SkincareAddiction and r/AsianBeauty. I’ve always been both a science nerd (currently working myself through a Masters program to be a physician assistant) and a product junkie, and those two things have gloriously collided over the last few months to the benefit of my skin! The AB side bar has an excellent list of blogs, one of which I fell way down deep into is The Acid Queen. Alli, who runs the blog, is a seriously impressive DIY’er, which allowed me to get involved in her guinea pig pool for testing product formulations she was currently tinkering with. I’ve spent the last five weeks testing her moisture barrier repair moisturizer, Liquid Gold, and here are my thoughts! The formatting of these sections is shamelessly ripped from bloggers whose reviewing formats I admire: Fiddy Snails, Skin & Tonics, Fan-B, Snow, and of course, Her Majesty The Acid Queen Herself ;)\n\n**What it’s supposed to do:** Liquid Gold is a moisture barrier repair moisturizer/emulsion. (For more info on what a moisture barrier is, see Skin & Tonics excellent moisture barrier post linked in the sources.) Liquid Gold takes your thinned out, red, overexfoliated, stinging, weakened skin and makes it supple, bouncy, strong, and able to tolerate some serious heavy-lifting from acids and actives. It accomplishes all this with the magic of CERAMIDES *oooh ahhhh*\n\n**How to use it:** We’ve got two recommended options here. The first is a thin layer all over your face as the first occlusive step of…well, however many of those you have. The second is a thicker layer as a deeper moisturizing sleeping pack of sorts. I’ve been going with option 1, twice a day every day, AM and PM. Its consistency is slightly thicker than a serum, but not as thick as a gel cream or oily despite the ingredients list (more on that in a moment). It’s BRIGHT yellow-orange from the sea buckthorn, but spreads pretty easily and only leaves the tiiiiniest yellow cast after I’ve spread it in. However, my paleness makes Casper the ghost look like a tanning bed addict, so I imagine on most other skin tones it wouldn’t be visible at all. One of the things I love about this product is how quickly it dries down. I’m (gleefully) looking down the barrel at 15+ steps in my PM routine, so anywhere I don’t have to wait for dry time, I’m a happy camper. I don’t wear makeup often, but I’ve brought it out a number of days to see how Liquid Gold plays under makeup. I’m pleased to say it holds up just fine, without makeup settling into fine lines, caking, or otherwise disintegrating throughout the day.\n\n[**Here's some photos of it in action!**](http://imgur.com/a/knjp4)\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (Aqua), Propylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Polyglyceryl-3 Methyglucose Distearate, Rosa Mosqueta (Rose) Hip Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Seed Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Fruit Oil, Panthenol, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Squalane (olive-derived), Cetyl Alcohol, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA.\n\n**Notable Ingredients:** Oh, man…all of them?! This ingredients list is STRAIGHT FIRE if we are talking moisture barrier repair. Let’s break that down, shall we? I’m going to limit my highlights because otherwise I will literally never finish this review.\n\n**Ceramide Complex** (Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP; Phytosphingosine; Cholesterol): The Beauty Brains, another fabulous “science of skincare” blog, has a great discussion of ceramides (see sources for link) and describes them so: “Ceramides form a kind of water-proofing barrier in the upper layers of skin. They’re not only critical for helping skin retain water but they also help repair the skin’s natural barrier and regulate cells. Ceramide production dwindles with age which can result in dry skin, wrinkles and even some types of dermatitis.” The other important thing to know about ceramides is that they are team players. Ceramides without fatty acids and cholesterol won’t get you very far. Specifically, ceramides penetrate best with a mixture of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% fatty acids. So maybe you’ll find a product with ceramide floating around in the ingredient list, but good luck finding one with all three players…and if you do, cross your fingers they’re in the optimal ratio. Except that’s exactly what we have in Liquid Gold. Hell yes.\n\n**Niacinamide:** Why hello, my old friend! I’ll let the Queen herself explain the wonders for niacinamide: “One of the most studied skincare ingredients, niacinamide does everything: smooths fine lines and wrinkles, increases ceramide and fatty acid synthesis, regulates skin cell turnover, fades hyperpigmentation, evens skin tone, and has powerful anti-inflammatory properties.” Naturally then, it seems like niaciamide is in errything these days, but who knows how much is in there? Niacinamide is most effective at 3-5%, so unless the percentage is disclosed, we’re left stacking niacinmide products to reach that threshhold. Liquid Gold has 4%, which happens to be the same amount you’d get if this ingredient was included in a Curology prescription. Jackpot.\n\n**Sea Buckthorn:** Again, from The Beauty Brains: “[Sea buckthorn is] known for being rich in a number of bioactive compounds, including the following: vitamins A, B1, B2, C, D, K, and P; omega 3, 6, 7, and 9; 43 lipids, organic acids, amino acids, folic acids, tocopherols, flavonoids, phenols, terpenes, tannins, [and] 20 mineral elements.” Okay…but what does all that do for your skin? Well, we’ve got some studies that show all that goodness adds up to improved wound healing, protection from UV damage, and increased collagen production (see sources for link).\n\n**Rose Hip Oil:** High in oleic and linoleic acids, both of which are polyunsaturated fatty acids important for the integrity and regeneration of skin cell membranes. More moisture barrier magic going on here, my friends.\n\n**Okay, but seriously…**everything in this ingredients list is AMAZING. And rightly so, that’s the whole idea behind DIY in the first place: if you make it yourself, you know everything is there for a reason without any fluff or fillers.\n\n**How it worked:** And here’s where the other part of the title of this post comes into play. I have a long and glorious history of overexfolating my skin because…well, basically because that’s what I thought I was supposed to do. Physical exfoliants, all sorts of acids, inappropriately high strength retinoids…I would throw them all at my face at once every single day until literally my whole top layer of skin peeled off in sheets in the shower and I was shiny and red as a cherry. Even normally gentle products would sting like the devil, and I never questioned it because I honestly thought that’s how it was supposed to work. I’d fry the life out of my skin until I couldn’t handle it (so like 3-4 straight days of all this), then take a break for a week, maybe less, and then I’d start all over again. It was a roller coaster, let me tell you, and I did this for years. \n\nThen I found this post on FutureDerm that totally blew my mind about setting a schedule for building tolerance to retinoids (see sources for link). So I mapped out my schedule for all 24 weeks and promised myself I would be patient. I went without actives for over a month, then took another crack at one night with lower strength Tazorac, my drug of choice. Disappointingly, I still peeled like a snake for the next three days, despite babying my skin before and after the Tazorac. The next week, the same thing. I was beginning to doubt the wisdom of the retinoid tolerance schedule.\n\nEnter Liquid Gold.\n\nI got on Alli’s testing list and got a bottle in the mail soon after. I am not exaggerating when I say this is literally the most amazing shit I have ever put on my face in my life. Redness starting receding within days. A night with retinoids was no longer followed with peeling, pain, redness, or stinging — all of my hallmarks of a compromised moisture barrier. I tentatively and slowly moved through increasing the frequency of the retinoid. Once, twice, three times, four times a week, two interminable week periods per increase. So far, so good. I can feel fairly confident that Liquid Gold is the responsible party here since the rest of my non-actives routine stayed stable while I was tinkering with how to reintroduce them after my hiatus. Gradually, I added all my actives back in so that now, here’s what I’ve got going on my face: 1) Tazorac 0.05% gel 4x/week; 2) Curology 0.009% tretinoin, 9% azelaic acid, 1% clindamycin every night; 3) Paula’s Choice Resist 2% BHA morning and night; 4) Timeless 20% Vitamin C+E Ferulic Acid serum (AM only).\n\nEvery time I wash my face, I think today will be the day I finally overdo it and start feeling my barrier damaged again. BUT NO. My skin feels strong, bouncy, resilient, and looks glowing. My husband pokes me in the face, nods knowingly, and declares, “Chok chok.” He’s right. Now, I’ve been throw actives at my face like there’s no tomorrow and my face takes it like a champ. Eventually, I’m hoping to add in an AHA and up my Tazorac to 0.1%, but my schedule says I’m not allowed to do that for another few months. I’m glowing like the goddamn North Star thanks to all those actives, and I can keep coming back for more thanks to the almost surreal talents of Liquid Gold.\n\nI started to panic a bit the closer I got to the end of my bottle since this was a DIY formula since I absolutely had neither time time nor inclination to whip up a batch myself and didn’t know what I would do when I ran out. The day before I was about to email Alli and beg her to keep making me some forever in exchange for my first born child, SHE OPENED HER OWN SHOP ONLINE!!! This is the best news my skin has ever had. I immediately purchased a 60 mL glass pump bottle of Liquid Gold for $24 from Stratia, The Acid Queen’s shop website. After having such a fabulous experience with this, you better believe I threw Rewind, her DMAE serum, into my cart with a quickness. \n\n**Conclusion:** This shit is my life now. It let’s me go active-crazy without unduly compromising my moisture barrier and makes my skin feel stronger than it has in my entire life. It’s affordable, pleasant to use day and/or night, well-formulated, conscientiously packaged, and made in-house by a fellow skincare junkie on the other side of the country. I couldn’t be happier to love this product and have the opportunity to support her shop.\n\n[Stratia Skin, Liquid Gold, $24](https://www.stratiaskin.com/collections/skincare/products/liquid-gold)\n\n*Disclosure: I was asked to write a review of this product that was originally intended only for Alli to read for formulation feedback and my experience with the product. I only decided to write it for public consumption when I realized she was opening the shop and other people could get this product. I did not accept the product with an agreement to review it positively, nor have I received any monetary compensation for doing so. All opinions expressed above are my own.*\t\n\n**Sources**\n[The Beauty Brains: Is sea buckthorn oil good for skin?](http://thebeautybrains.com/2014/07/is-sea-buckthorn-oil-good-for-skin/)\n[The Beauty Brains: Is rose hip oil good for anti-aging?](http://thebeautybrains.com/2015/01/is-rose-hip-oil-good-for-anti-aging/)\n[The Beauty Brains: Are ceramides good anti-aging ingredients?](http://thebeautybrains.com/2015/04/are-ceramides-good-anti-aging-ingredients-episode-77/)\n[Stratia Skin: Liquid Gold](https://stratiaskin.com/products/liquid-gold)\n[Skin & Tonics: The Importance of Fatty Acids, pH & the Moisture Barrier: How I Eliminated my Acne & Decreased my Skin Sensitivity](http://skinandtonics.com/the-importance-of-fatty-acids-ph-moisture-barrier-how-i-eliminated-my-acne-decreased-my-skin-sensitivity/)\n[The Acid Queen: Fun with DIY: Beginners Recipe Shopping List](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/02/16/fun-with-diy-beginners-recipe-shopping-list/)\n[The Acid Queen: Fun with DIY: Moisture Barrier Serum](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2015/11/03/fun-with-diy-moisture-barrier-serum/)\n[FutureDerm: 11 Things You Never Knew about Retinol and Retinoids Until Now](https://www.futurederm.com/11-things-you-never-knew-about-retinol-and-retinoids-until-now/)",

This is my cautionary tale.  I am eczema prone (on body) so I have a naturally weak moisture barrier. Last summer with all the snail, ceramides and HA my AB game was so good,  I started using a pro retinol serum nightly and some AHA and BHA. I could not believe how well I tolerated it. I was not new to actives.   I was shedding a lot of stuff out of my pores, but no irritation.  Nice and plump.  Suddenly my face got sunken and older.  It was my moisture barrier. Somehow I figured it out and backed off.   I recovered quickly.",

I just wanted to add some  impressions and my skin type.\n\nI have dry, sensitive, always-red skin with hormonal acne. I tested Liquid Gold on half my face for two weeks and it didn't cause any visible changes. No increase in acne, no miraculous redness reduction. I find it very minimally moisturizing. My skin still feels dry and tight after letting it sink in (which I agree happens quickly) and I have to follow it with a heavier moisturizer (or three.) There is just a tiny amount of stickiness and little to no slip after it dries/absorbs.\n\nI, too, have been trying to find a way to use actives without over-exfoliating. Daily use of a mild BHA and AHA has proven too harsh in the past, so I've been increasing in frequency very  slowly and now I'm up to every other day with no discomfort or peeling, even when combining BHA and AHA and using my stronger products.\n\nI'm really happy with Liquid Gold and see myself using it indefinitely. The price and ingredients speak for themselves, and the packaging is really nice too. One last thing I just thought of: I was showing it to my mom and she had an irritated spot on her hand from a cut or something, so I put this on that spot and she said it was amazingly soothing.",

    "body": "To me, price tag doesnt matter. Its whats INSIDE that matters. and i feel like i see a lot of people ignore the ingredients of their skincare and are getting scammed. on both the low dollar tree end and and the high end.\n\nNow i am not one to be scared of anything with a scientific name like Hydrogen oxide or call everything 'Chemicals'. But if a product claims to have a certain ingredient and its the LAST thing on the list under even fragrance and preservatives, i have questions. Or for what ingredients they claim to have they then package improperly like Vitamin C and Retinal in clear bottles.\n\nSome brands at the DT have proven time and time again to just not use enough of an active they claim they have in a product and its just a waste of my $1.25 (im looking at you BOLERO) while others have shockingly good ingredients like skin nutrition botanicals.\n\nAs a long time DT lover, this newer brand BPure is giving me Bolero vibes with some of their products, and thats an insult.... For example the new glow up serums. I took a look at the ingredients and they just dont line up with the claims on the package.\n\nHere are the ingredients for the strawberry one:\n\nWATER, GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, PEG/PPG-17/6 COPOLYMER, POLYSORBATE 80, HYDROXYACETOPHENONE, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, CARBOMER, SODIUM ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, ISOHEXADEC- ANE, NIACINAMIDE, CAPRYLHY-DROXAMIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, DISODIUM EDTA. FRAGRANCE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, SODIUM HYALURONATE. SALICYLIC ACID, ACACIA SENEGAL GUM. LINALOOL, FRAGARIA ANANASSA (STRAWBERRY) FRUIT EXTRACT, CITRIC ACID, CARMINE (CI 75470)\n\nThis claims to have AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) and just just does not. it has citric acid which is technically an AHA, but its at the end of the list and in that amount is not doing anything. and the strawberry extract can be considered a 'natural aha' but again, thats not the claims and its so low it wont work like an AHA.\n\nHaving most the actives listed under fragrance means its likely under 1%. The Salicylic acid has to be like 1-2% to work. At MOST this serum is hydrating. but a very basic hydration at that. Which isnt bad, but not what it claims at ALL.\n\nBut then there are brands like skin nutrition and their claims on their products and the ingredients are actually shocking. The actives they claim are there in their true form (not like the AHA lie in the last one). They have correct percentages (and often TELL YOU the % for a lot of things). While they might not be the most life changing product, based on formula alone, they weirdly outclass a lot of brands and their claims for $1.25\n\nWhile i enjoy trying all the new products that come out, when i see items like the BPure strawberry smoothing serum, i get frustrated. They clearly can make and sell quality products like skin nutrition. It feels like they have started to pump out poor performing products that probably have a better profit margin since they dont contain very much of the more expensive ingredients and its \"just a $1.25\" so people scoop them all up since its viral.\n\nIs anyone else seeing this with recent launches? And BPure has put out some great products too, but they are so hit or miss with their claims and how they line up with whats in them. Just because i shop at DT doesnt mean i want to over consume. and i know its easy to just try everything, but it adds up. \n\nwhat viral DT beauty products have you noticed like this? what are your thought on this? Do you just trust what the product is claiming? What are your thoughts?\n\n",

        "body": "Buying DT beauty/skincare is  an option for those who enjoy frequently trying new products, love to experiment, and prefer an inexpensive/budget shopping experience. Over the years I have tried some DT products but have left behind most I had initially considered.  Because after checking the ingredient list, I have concluded that many  products simply won’t meet my needs. Fragrance, niacinamide, floral/fruit extracts are a no. Instead I stick to the OG skincare/haircare/cosmetic products that have never disappointed and I know work for my skin.  I just buy these on sale, stack my coupons, use store promotions and CVS ExtraBucks to restock the products I have already learned work best. For example, a bar of Vanicream soap might be as low as $4 after coupons and promotions. A Maybelline mascara might cost $5. That’s the same cost as four DT products at the current 1.25 price point.  Sure, I could buy 4 DT mascaras for that same $5, but they likely won’t be as effective or as consistent as a Maybelline product. However, if I saw my favorite Maybelline mascara at DT I would certainly buy at least two!\n\nWe can choose how to consume and we can all become smarter consumers. If an active ingredient is dead last or very far down the list, there’s a good chance that ingredient has such a low percentage that it will not produce appreciable results.\n\nAn educated DT consumer is a happier consumer. ❤️",

        "body": "I agree with a lot of what you have said. I think that those specific watermelon, strawberry, Avocado, etc. bpure serums are sort of useless and definitely unnecessary. Not Worth even your $1.25. And so I totally agree with that. \n\nI also agree that there are definitely products that don't have amounts of ingredients that are even going to be effective just like you said. That being said, I think a lot of people hear \"Dollar Tree\" and think, there's no way there's anything good in there or anything in an amount that's effective, which just isn't necessarily true at all. And so I'm glad that you also mentioned a couple brands that are doing good things cause I actually think there are several brands that have extremely effective combinations additionally. \n\nOne thing I thought would be important to point out for those who aren't as adept at ingredient list reading, It isn't always just about how high up in the ingredient list the ingredient is. Some things just have to come in very small percentages for the best situation for your skin. People think they want retinol to be the second ingredient, but we don't usually want like a huge percentage of retinol or something else. AND sometimes a large amount of retinol isn't even helpful if it's not actually being delivered into the skin with proper mechanisms. So an amount of retinol or Vitamin C or whatever underneath 1% could still be effective depending on the situation. \n\nThe whole vitamin C thing is super complicated as well because there's different types of vitamin C that require different percentages to be effective. And also it's just a not a very stable ingredient and so there's a lot of confusion there. \n\nHowever, that being said, I don't think we should write off all clear bottles that have what we consider sun sensitive ingredients like retinol. Studies have shown that while some ingredients prone to deteriorating in sunlight, that is specific to sunlight and not just like the light within the store or within the warehouse. And so in actuality, most of the product is not going to be exposed to very much sunlight at all because it would be made in a factory, stored in boxes, transported in boxes. And then stored in the store until you take it home. And then you have to decide where you're going to put it. It probably experiences minimal deterioration in such circumstances. So saying oh the retinol etcetera in this product is completely ineffective because it's in a clear bottle is over-simplistic and negating a lot of the good. \n\nOverall I agree with you but I just wanted to add some of my thoughts.",

I think it's very important people take the time to learn what different ingredients are for (retinol, AHAs, BHAs, etc.), which ones should be in dark bottles/stored in certain temperatures, avoid damaging/irritating your skin by mixing ones that shouldn't be applied together, etc. Your skin is an organ so I think it's important to keep educating yourself and protect your skin!",

I buy cleanser and sometimes moisturizer from DT because I don’t really need actives per se from these products since I use Adapalene. I’m currently using the glow recipe watermelon moisturizer dupe which has niacinamide. I don’t know the quality of the niacinamide nor the percentage but for 1.25 I’m willing to try it since I’m not relying on it solely for an active ingredient. I prefer moisturizers with niacinamide when I can find them at DT. To me this moisturizer is meh - the packaging is nice since it’s a glass jar and it’s 2 oz. But it’s a very “wet” texture which I don’t like because then I can’t apply while my face is still damp which is customary for me. It takes a while to dry too. \n\nAs a side note - does anyone know if you can or need to exfoliate while using Adapalene? The packaging says not to use any other acne product so I just really haven’t really tried it but was curious if anyone knew.",

    "body": "Triple O's burgers leave nothing to be desired for me. I would like to replicate them at home.\n\nI, embarrassingly enough, have scoured multiple reddit threads on this subject. Most of the answers suggest Triple O Sauce is simply mayo and red hamburger relish. I've tried Strubs Hamburger Relish from IGA.. it's really close, close enough for me. However.. it is not confirmed.\n\nThe mayo! The mayo does not taste like Hellman's or Miracle Whip (bleh). It's thicker, it has a more neutral taste. Based on my gluttonous research it turns out many restaurants use \"heavy duty mayo\" which is different than what grocery stores sell. It holds firmer for a longer period of time and does not melt quite as easily. Convenient for restaurants when used as a dipping sauce or sitting under a heat lamp for extended periods of time.\n\nIt appears, based on some commenters on previous threads, that the mayo is delivered from Sysco. Some suspect there is **paprika** in the sauce, providing a slight pink/orange colour. Could it be Sysco Classic Banquet Extra Heavy Duty Mayonnaise? There is paprika in the ingredients list. Or perhaps Triple O's has a custom sauce they have delivered through Sysco distributors.\n\n[https://www.instacart.com/products/19277139-sysco-mayonnaise-banquet-extra-heavy-duty-1-gl](https://www.instacart.com/products/19277139-sysco-mayonnaise-banquet-extra-heavy-duty-1-gl)\n\n## Ingredients\n\nSoybean Oil, Water, Egg Yolks, Distilled White Vinegar, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Contains Less than 2% of Salt, Mustard Flour, Natural Flavor, Calcium Disodium EDTA (to Preserve Flavor), **Paprika**, Garlic Powder, Onion Powder.\n\nInformants, traitors, enemies of Nat Bailey - flock to this thread and reveal your secrets!",

This tangy and creamy sauce is perfect for burgers and other dishes. Here's a recipe inspired by the flavors of Triple-O's sauce:\n\nIngredients:\n\n-    1 cup mayonnaise\n-    1/4 cup ketchup\n-    2 tablespoons relish (preferably dill pickle relish)\n-    1 tablespoon white vinegar\n-    1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce\n-    1/2 teaspoon onion powder\n-    1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n-    Salt and pepper to taste\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.    In a medium-sized bowl, combine the mayonnaise, ketchup, relish, white vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, and garlic powder.\n2.    Stir the ingredients together until well combined. Make sure the sauce is smooth and the ingredients are evenly distributed.\n3.    Taste the sauce and season with salt and pepper according to your preference. Add a little at a time, tasting as you go, until you achieve the desired flavor.\n4.    Once seasoned, cover the bowl with plastic wrap or transfer the sauce to a sealed container. Refrigerate the sauce for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. This step is important for achieving the best taste.\n5.    After chilling, give the sauce a final stir before serving. It's now ready to be enjoyed!\n\nYou can use Triple-O's sauce as a condiment for burgers, sandwiches, fries, or even as a dip for chicken nuggets. Feel free to adjust the ingredient quantities to suit your taste preferences. Enjoy your homemade Triple-O's sauce!",

    "body": "Garmi aaa gayi haiiii\\~ dhoop badh hui hai aur heatwaves pardhaar chuke hai 🥵🥵 obviously we need sunscreens! I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae](https://preview.redd.it/04x8cx1jvsy81.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db29ff28ad9fbcd3ff56a158d60e872ed63cb538)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\nand that's all from my side! I know its not much but then again kangaal haalaat mein kharidaari mushkil hai 💀. anyway, here's a list ss that I do want to try once this lot is finished:\n\n* sunscoop sunscreen serum (only if dermaco doesnt work lmao. really intrigued)\n* Face shop sunscreens (itne variants . ek try karne ka mann hai 😖)\n* beauty of joseon rice ss (stock mein aaja bhai 😫)\n* missha sun aqua gel and essence (bas aise hi lol)\n\nI've also tried the neutrogena ultra sheer, episoft , a few banana boat ones but way long ago so I don't clearly remember them to give the verdict on them. just if I haven't repurchased them, consider that they didn't work well for me.\n\nhope this was informational and you guys enjoyed! if you still have any other questions related to the product above, feel free to comment!",

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

Pictured above.\n\n**Fragrance:**  ~~Yes. An extremely artificial flowery scent. Dissipates, but I find it slightly annoying while applying.~~. None. \n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:** Got this when my previous gel moisturiser got over. I had already used the other 3 and I started using this with fairly high expectations. And I was / am disappointed. **It's not bad. It moisturises**. But I was expecting a jelly like moisturiser that sinks in easily while still packing a moisture -filled punch. And this is not that. It takes way longer than I'd like to sink in.  I either have to compromise on the quantity I use and the moisturised feeling or go around feeling oiler than I would like. It's the kind of product that does everything to some level, but none of them spectacularly or to an above average level.\n\nAs far as healing for barrier damage is concerned, I get way faster results from the other three Bioderma moisturisers and I pretty much never touch this for that purpose after the initial trial period.\n\nThis does have a few de-pigmenting ingredients, but so far I've not been able to see anything results that I can directly attribute to this product.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:**  Moisturised feeling. I've used this with actives that are known to cause dryness and faced no issues. It can handle drying actives. No glow noticed. No standout effects.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:**  Can't think of anything. If you start using this with low / zero expectations, you'll probably like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status:**  Jury's still out, haven't decided. But as of now it's a **Will Not Repurchase.**\n\n\n***Additional Notes on whether the product is fake****\n\n**Tl;dr: Old tube is genuine, NOT FAKE.  Confirmed by brand too. Review still stands**\n \n\nOn 24th October 2023\n\n1. Some people's experiences does not coincide with mine in important ways such as fragrance and I'm now wondering if mine was a fake, I contacted Bioderma but haven't received any info yet. But I'll update and or delete the review when I do get it. \n\n2 Of 5 people, 4 can't smell anything from their product and 1 can (but doesn't sound similar to my description. & Bioderma still hasn't replied :(\n\nOn 1st November 2023\n\n1. Bioderma replied on Instagram that my moisturiser is genuine, By the time they replied, I had already repurchased another tube from Tira, to check for myself. The new tube has already arrived and they are identical in all ways. Including from the same batch 😅. \n\n2. New tube arrived with bioderma samples, which jogged my memory. Old tube had also arrived with samples. Two of which I still have unopened. So chances of old tube being fake is 0.\n\n2. But the smell was still different. My old tube smells like a flower. My new one doesn't smell of anything, unless I put copious amounts on my arm and put my nose in it and even then it smells like a teeny bit chemically, Thats all. I can understand why most people say it smells like nothing, because that's what I would have said too, if I wasn't looking that closely. \n\n3. Anyway, I was breaking my head trying to figure out why my old tube is has that smell, And then it struck me. I had a perfume leak incident in my travel kit many months ago. Most of the stuff is replaced and I don't still have that perfume, so I'd kind of forgotten. The tube was new then and I didn't use it enough to note the frag or lack thereof. I think the gel or top of the packaging still smells of the perfume and that's why I was mistaken. \n\nSo that was much ado about nothing, apologies. \n\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Atoderm Intensive baume\n\n**MRP:** 786 for 75 ml. Available in 45ml,  200 ml tube and  500 ml pump bottle.\n\n**Texture:** White Cream.  Pictured above.

It doesn't smell exactly like grease but it reminds me of grease. It's a dusty, chemically smell that I associate with Bioderma moisturisers. Like if you've smelled any of the Bioderma moisturisers, all except the gel-creme have the same DNA, though they are not exactly the same. It's not repulsive, but it's there. Does dissipate after a minute or so.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  I bought this on a whim after a few friends raved about it. They were so so so right. This was the second bioderma cream moisturiser I used, so I knew it would help with barrier issues but it does so much more. When I first used this, I had oily to combination skin and I never ever used cream moisturisers by choice. I had a misconception that since I was an acne / clog prone, oily skinned person, that I need to stay as far away from cream moisturisers as possible. This is the moisturiser than changed my mind.\n\nIf I want a one and done PM product when I'm too tired or too lazy or too whatever, I reach for it.\n\nIf I want a one and done travel moisturiser, this is the only one I pack.\n\nSuper dry climate, this is it.\n\nAirplane dryness, this is it.\n\nSlight tingling, or signs of barrier damage incoming, this is it.\n\nBarrier damage, this is it.\n\nDerm procedures, this is it.\n\nBut in even other scenarios such as humid climate or AM routine, where this is NOT my ideal or go-to product, it still does a decent job. It holds its own. It can be greasy but hey it can be worked with. It does an amazing job moisturising without clogging pores for me.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:**\n\nMoisturised feeling.  Super soft skin. Heals Barrier overnight depending on damaged your skin is. It's my tried and tested barrier recovery product.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The heaviness, I guess. Upto combination skin or barrier-damaged oily skin, it's fine. Very oily skinned people may want to avoid this for general use.\n\n**Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** Have repurchased 3 or 4 times. Will continue to repurchase till it's discontinued. Love it. **Holy Grail.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Bioderma Sensibio Forte Rapid soothing cream\n\nMRP: 1499 for 40 ml.\n\n**Texture:** White Cream.  Pictured above. Heavy feeling on the skin.\n\n**Ingredient List :**  [Aqua/​Water/​Eau](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum)](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/paraffinum-liquidum), [Beeswax (Cera Alba)](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cera-alba), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Cetyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-alcohol), [Glycyrrhetinic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycyrrhetinic-acid), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [Palmitic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/palmitic-acid), [Stearic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/stearic-acid), [Sorbitan Sesquioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitan-sesquioleate),[Tocopheryl Acetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tocopheryl-acetate), [Mannitol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/mannitol), [Xylitol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/xylitol), [Rhamnose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/rhamnose), [Fructooligosaccharides](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/fructooligosaccharides), [Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laminaria-ochroleuca-extract), 🌟[**Allantoin**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/allantoin)**, 🌟** [**Sodium Pca**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-pca), [Caprylyl Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylyl-glycol), [Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylic-capric-triglyceride), [Pentylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentylene-glycol),[1,2-Hexanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/1-2-hexanediol), [Carbomer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/carbomer), [Triethanolamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/triethanolamine)\n\n**Fragrance:**  Yes. A different version of that greasy smell.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  This was first prescribed by my then dermatologist for application after a MNRF session. And since then till Atoderm intensive baume came into my life, this was a re-buy. **Slightest irritation, and I used to apply it**. I have urticaria, this helped with many of my allergic reaction episodes. **Skin will feel greasy, but it was soothing at the same time.** As soon as the greasiness disappeared, I used to reapply. **This was never a daily use moisturiser for me.** I kind of used it like medicine. As and when needed, at the quantity, I needed. However the soothing it provides does overlap with the Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume and I've not repurchased this in more than a year. I simply use that, wherever I previously reached for this. I have a feeling this is a gold standard product for certain sub set of people who need a rich, soothing moisturiser, but for most of us, this can be a pass.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:** Moisturised feeling. Very soothing on irritated skin.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The heaviness, I guess. Upto combination skin or barrier-damaged oily skin, it's fine. Very oily skinned people may want to avoid this for general use. And the price.

I love it only slightly lesser than Atoderm Intensive Baume and mostly because it's comparatively way more expensive. 😅.  I wouldn't use this daily, there's no need, but definitely a barrier saviour product. I wake up with such soft glowy skin even when it's damaged, like the healthy part of my skin feel look glowy even if skin damage texture is still there to an extent.\n\n***Comparing with baume, since I use them both for similar reasons :*** I originally had the impression this was heavier than Atoderm Intensive Baume and that it forms a suffocating seal on the skin. This isn't true under normal circumstances. It does feel suffocating when barrier is SEVERELY damaged but not otherwise. I applied this on half and the baume of half my face to check if there's any major difference and no. **No functional difference noticed.**\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:** Soothing, Healing, Moisturising, it does it all.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The price. And for a lotion consistency product it's quite heavy.\n\n**Repurchase Status**: When I started writing this review, this was going to be a WNRP, because between all of them, I'd only repurchase Atoderm Intensive Baume, but ngl, the more I thought about it, I find myself wavering. **This is a WRP.** I don't know when, but I'll probably come back to this at some point.\n\n# \n\n# Comparision\n\n***Ranking based on Use Case***\n\n||1st Choice|2nd Choice|3rd Choice|4th Choice|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|As an AM Moisturiser|None of them|Intensive Gel-creme|Intensive Baume|Sensibio Forte|\n|As an PM Moisturiser|Intensive Baume, Cicabio, Intensive Gel-creme, Sensibio Forte||||\n|Time taken for Healing|Cicabio|Sensibio Forte, Intensive Baume|Intensive Gel-creme||\n|Versatility (Can work for any of the above use cases in a pinch)|Intensive Baume|Intensive Gel-creme|Cicabio|Sensibio Forte|\n\nI've ranked them after considering the following factors (these are the most important deciding factors for me personally).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***As  AM Moisturiser:***\n\n**I would use absolutely none of them as an AM moisturiser.** That doesn't mean they can't be used as such. it's just that none of them absorb in minutes or 'set' when you use a normal amount or slather it on. They're all occlusive but not the matte kind. Intensive Gel-creme is the easiest one of them to use as an AM moisturiser.\n\nThis gif will show you how long it took for them to sink into my arm, which is way dryer than my skin. But caveat is that I don't always use a AM moisturizer (infact I very very rarely do), but i when I do, I slather it on like below. If you use a teeny teeny weeny bit, you might not face this issue. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/isq9941kddwb1.gif\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***As PM Moisturiser:***\n\nI can't actually decide I love them all. Atleast I love Intensive Baume, Sensibio Forte and Cicabio, but there's nothing to complain about the gel creme either. ✨ **Skin just looks so nourished with all the Bioderma moisturisers.** ✨  If you use only a tiny amount, all of them will sink in by morning. I like to slather them all on. And how much is absorbed by morning completely depends on how damaged my skin is. If I catch signs of barrier damage early and use them, they'll sink in. If I've completely wrecked my skin, there will be residue when I wake up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***On healing***\n\nTime taken for healing: shortest to longest, ranked above. But honestly, most people don't need a moisturiser stronger than Intensive Baume even for barrier damage.\n\n**Note on the likeliness of clogging pores and causing acne: I've personally not had breakouts from any of them. None of them caused acne for me.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\n👉🏾 All 4 moisturisers are good.\n\n👉🏾 For most people Sensibio Forte & Cicabio is not necessary. Unless you have facial wounds, surgery on your face, intensive derm procedures, very bad rosacea and are prescribed or recommended these, I'd say skip them.  People with sensitive skin may like them though.\n\n👉🏾 If you have oily skin, you might like Bioderma Intensive gel creme.\n\n👉🏾 Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume has ceramides, fatty acids and cholesterol. Ratio unknown, will link if I can find anything.\n\n👉🏾 I've seen a fair number of people mention that baume is heavy and breaks them out in this sub. Something to be aware of.\n\n👉🏾  If I had to suggest only one product, from the above, hands down it'll be Atoderm Intensive Baume and it's best cost - benefit wise too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Im going to buy the cica +arnica to try out next. The Atoderm Creme Ultra doesn't seem interesting enough to me to want to try. If I can get a mini or sample somewhere just to update this post, I'll do that.\n\nETA2: After writing so much I still like left somethings out , so I'm editing to add them. Apologies 🙏\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs with any other review, YMMV",

Normal is the operative word here because ain't nobody washing their face like actors in a commercial,that's clearly abnormal.\n\n🐳 **What works** : This was recommended by my dermat after a bout of eczema 2 years back and I absolutely swear by it. It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured. [I brought mine from this one.](https://instagram.com/_vivanka_chennai?igshid=5brie36vc4w2)\n\n\n\n🔵 **TONER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **DermaFique All Important Toner** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260\n\n🐳 **Application** : I got this transferred into a mist spray bottle because I quite enjoy the feeling of being spring irrigated. So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you! Rest your eyes for a bit,it did endure quite a bit of a strain with this one :P",

It was a recommendation from a Thai friend, apparently it’s super popular in SE Asia. It’s manufactured by the same parent company and has a similar ingredient list with Bifida Lystate as the 2nd ingredient. \nThe only con for me is that it has alcohol in it.

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F18 (umar badh gayi but dimaag nahi 💀)**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , acne (pustules, fungal and cystic) pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae ](https://preview.redd.it/fnjipguox9ma1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d880ff6b482ade3f03237375ef02cdd64fb4e3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( .

I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl  Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise!

I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a  fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\n* **The Derma Co.** **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum** \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredient list** : Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less 😖 if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would  get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation.

I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop 😭. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :(  but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nupdate : this ones a hard no for me. is it calming? yes. but the whitecast is too much. and when i sweat it literally looks like I'm secreting milk from my skin  (~~nipple)😭😭~~\n\n**rating** : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/​PPG-10/​1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool 🤤 only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure! in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty 😖 I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao 😌 so you can guess I go out a lot heheh. I feel like this one is getting over sooner than others in my ss ki theli 😫 but either way, if you find a good deal on it, blindly add this to your cart and order it. you wont be dissappointed!\n\nrating : 5/5 and WRP on reduced mrp only.\n\n* **Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun : Rice + Probiotics (SPF50+ PA++++)**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1530 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1200 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : dry, sensitive, acne prone and combination\n\n**texture and appearance** : creamy white lotion (ya nasty-). unscented ( ha, ha , aur socho ashleel cheeze 🤡)\n\n**ingredients list :**   Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Water, Glycerin, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Behenyl Alcohol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Sodium Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Water, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/​VP Copolymer, Polyisobutene, Silica, Caprylyl/​Capryl Glucoside, Sorbitan Oleate, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Bifida Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacillus Ferment,Streptococcus Thermophilus Ferment\n\n**filters :**\n\n* uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nthis deserves all the hype it gets on the net. my current and forever HG sunscreen (unless they change formulation). seriously this ticks all the boxes . no whitecast? check. great filters? check. doesn't make you face look like you rub pan grease on it? check. it absorbs so well and is more moisturizing than some of the moisturizers out there. obviously, wished we would get more quantity for the price paid but itna criticise karne ke baad bhi, brands toh behre hai 😔and on reapplication, doesnt feel like im doing the 100 layers challenge lol. plus , I don't feel regret when applying it these days, cuz no fear of sunscreen melting during winters (#rajailife) . *taareef karu kya uski, jisneee tujhe banayaaaa✨\\~*\n\n**rating :** 5/5 and forever HG\n\n* **Benton Mineral Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 15g (haalat kharab biros). got it at 30% on beauty barn\n\n**For skin types** : normal and sensitive skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : a white stick. that's it. kind of a really thick lotion like texture. unscented and smol. mineral sunstick.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Coco-caprylate/caprate, sunflower seed wax, propylene glycol dicaprylate, H-di/trimethylol hexyllactone cross polymer, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, titanium dioxide, dicaprylyl carbonate, Synthetic fluorphlogopite, vinyl dimethicone, microcrystalline wax, aluminum stearate, polyhydroxystearic acid, purslane extract, centella extract, sodium hyaluronate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, sodium Acetylated hyaluronate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, polyglyceryl-4diisostearate/polyhydroxystearate/sebacate, silica, alumina, pentylene glycol, allantoin, panthenol, Glycerin, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Xylyl Glucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Glucose, Glyceryl Caprylate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Stearic Acid, Tocopherol, Purified Water, 1, 2-hexanediol, ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**filters** :\n\n* titanium dioxide\n\nthis one came around the same time as the tocobo sunstick on beauty barn so being the ✨phisool kharchi wala baccha✨, I bought both of them. unfortunately , this one was a big letdown. how tf can a sunstick leave a whitecast? this one is a great example. first off, it requires a lot of pressing and dragging across the face to dispense , so not fond of that, especially when I have active acne. secondly, it legit looks like someone rubbed fair and lovely mixed with water on my face 💀. its not waterproof, expensive for the quantity you get and gives a disappointing finish and result. I'm not particularly sure about protection against sun on this one but oh well. also piddu si stick hai so kind of cute but lootne wala hai lmao\n\n**rating** : 2/5 and WNRP\n\n* **Tocobo** **Cotton Soft Airy Sun Stick SPF50 Pa++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1550 for 20g (bought at 1100 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily, combination, acne prone skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale blue long cylinderical like stick. has a really pleasant and soft floral fragrance . leaves a matte fininsh and doesnt feel greasy on apllication. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list :**  Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Niacinamide, Tromethamine, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Pentylene Glycol, Polysilicone-15, Vigna Radiata Seed Extract, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Extract, Sophora Flavescens Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum Root/Stalk Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Oenothera Biennis (evening primrose) Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Seed Oil, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Fragrance\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* titanium dioxide (physical filter)\n\nprobably the only sun stick that comes even close to the isntree sun stick. this gives such a good matte finish without any greasy feel . plus has cute floral smell to it that doesn't transfer to your skin or anything. and damn what a bang for a buck. probably the closest dupe for the isntree one. the only con is that it kind of pills after the 3rd application and rubs of oily after a while. if you are a person who touches their face every once in a while (like my dumbass), you might find it a bit uncomfortable. that being said, most of the times I just blot the grease away after 3-4hrs of application and apply another layer afterwards. sun protection wise, it does a good job! my forehead is the area that is the most prone to getting tan and it looked quite even toned after 3 weeks of consecutive use. one of my most favorite sticks (😏)\n\n**rating** : 4.5/5 and lets seeee\n\n* **Neutrogena beach defense sun stick water + sun protection SPF 50+**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs 1260 for 42 g (got it at Rs. 900 from amazon)\n\n**for skin types** : honestly, none lmao. I used it as a body stick most of the time with how oily this was. but can be used by anyone ig\n\n**texture and appearance** : whitish yellow stick. has a fruity kind of smell. really oily and greasy on first application that doesn't absorb or goes away after a while.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Polyethylene, Isohexadecane, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Ozokerite, Paraffin, Synthetic Beeswax, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Neopentyl Glycol Diisostearate, Dimethicone, Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Fragrance, BHT\n\n**filters** :\n\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n\noof this was an impulse purchase that I regretted later on. mind you, this is a great sunstick for your body but definitely not for your face . not to mention its waterproof . but the tapti garmi really just melts everything in its way and this is no exception. bhai itna chip chipa lagta hai i dont even feel like putting this on just because of the MoIsT feeling it gives. unless you're going to a pool or beach (as it suggests duh) , if you're okay with feeling like [that peanut butter baby](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.ie%2Flife%2Ffamily%2Fthis-peanut-butter-baby-is-sure-to-brighten-up-your-day-31499579.html&psig=AOvVaw0Qc7SXcD436wP5Ywrn_yJv&ust=1678212392776000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCIDzt77yx_0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) , then you can give it a try. it  does provide a good amount of product for the price and is a solid waterproof one fosho. but nahi jhela jata for some reason 😣😣😫\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\nme after buying and trying all of these to find my HG\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zzjpjrbly9ma1.gif\n\nbut it was fun doing this in a span of a few years and I finally got one that fits all my boxes . the BOJ one is seriously godsent for me ✨✨~~lets just ignore that it makes my wallet cry every time I buy it .~~ But id rather spend more on stuff that works than just hit and trials lmao. also I've gone past my obsession on using sun sticks as a whole since they require quite a lot of pressing while applying and the application just irritates my acne a lot 😫 imma finish the ones I have but I have no intentions on buying anymore from any brands (even though the minimalist and earth rhythm ones look good 🤡)more reviews to come! ill be doing one on stuff my dad will be bringing from the U.S in the next few weeks so do let me know if you'd like a follow up on those too! (~~why do i treat my posts like a sitcom😭).~~  and as always, any other questions, comments are always welcomed and so are dms!\n\nbyeeee 💖💖",

        "body": "also my post exceeded the word limit so here's some more lmao :\n\n   \n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF      50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n   \n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte      Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable      UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB      filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV      filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB      mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change",

In case you missed the previous reviews, here are [Tosowoong Apricot Seed Cleansing Oil] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/7u2j65/review_tosowoong_apricot_seed_cleansing_oil/) and [Benton Honest TT Mist] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/7trt3u/review_benton_honest_tt_mist/). As always, questions and criticism about the reviews are welcome!\n\n**Missha Near Skin Total Ceramide Cream**\n\nIf you know me, then you know that finding a good moisturizer has been the bane of my existence. I've tried Nivea Soft, Cosrx Honey Ceramide Full Moisture Cream, Holika Holika Skin & Good Cera Super Cream, and FAB Ultra Repair Cream, all within the past few months, and none of them have felt right for my dry, acne-prone, and sometimes dehydrated skin. Nivea Soft changes its ingredients depending on the country, and with the amount I move, I don't want to patch test every time I buy a new tub. Holika Holika was good, but a bit sticky, and I'm wary of the botanical extracts in the reformulation. Cosrx was too greasy, while FAB was too dry. It's a veritable Goldilocks and the Three Bears situation but with moisturizers instead of porridge. \n\nEnter my \"just right\" moisturizer: Missha Near Skin Total Ceramide Cream. This is the first moisturizer I'm actually happy enough with to repurchase, and that says a lot about what a great product it is. \n\n**Packaging:** I'm a sucker for Glossier's minimalist white and millennial pink vibe. So it's no surprise that I love the packaging of the two Missha products currently on my shelf. The Total Ceramide Cream comes in a 50ml white metal tube with a small plastic screw-on cap and black text. It would probably look starkly medical if it weren't for the pink bands near the end of the tube that make it vaguely minimalist chic. Do I purposefully nestle this product between my Milky Jelly Cleanser and my pink and white Missha sunscreen? Absolutely. \n\nAesthetics aside, the tube is actually one of my least favorite things about the cream. While it's a nice size, and I appreciate the fact that it's not plastic, it's like a tube of toothpaste in that it flattens out the more you use. I still have about half a tube left to go, but I expect it'll be difficult to get every last drop of moisturizer out. I also have read some reviews where people's tubes ripped open when they got bent. I have a trip coming up in two weeks, and will be interested in seeing how it fares in my carry-on.\n\n**Ingredients:** A cosDNA analysis of this product shows it to be relatively clean. The three acne triggers that pop up are Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, and hydrogenated vegetable oil, which rate 1, 2, and 3 respectively. As for good things, the cream contains three different types of ceramides: Ceramide 3, Ceramide 9, and Ceramide AP, as well as shea butter and meadowfoam seed oil, all of which are towards the top or middle of the ingredients list. So as long as you have no sensitivities with any of the ingredients, this should be a pretty good moisturizer for anyone with dry skin or who is trying to repair their moisture barrier. \n\nOne really interesting thing about the Total Ceramide Cream is that is contains Maltobionic Acid, a PHA. PHAs are chemical exfoliants that are supposedly as effective as AHAs, but without the sensitizing effects, due to their larger molecular structure ([Source](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/exfoliant/polyhydroxy-acid.html)). So theoretically, this cream should have some brightening properties, just like an AHA. I was definitely worried trying this out, because even though PHAs are gentle, the idea of putting any kind of chemical exfoliant into a product marketed for people with compromised moisture barriers made me wary.\n\nHere is the full ingredients list as printed on the side of the box: \n\nWater, Glycerin, Caprylic ICapric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Olivate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Sorbitan Olivate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Ceramide NP, Phytosteryl/octyldodecyl Lauroyl Glutamate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Phytosphingosine, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide AP, Carbomer, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Maltobionic Acid, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Tromethamine, Lecithin, Trideceth-10, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium EDTA, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n**Price:** $14 on Jolse, which works out to about 28 cents per milliliter, making this the second least expensive moisturizer I've tried thus far. \n\n**Use and Performance:** The texture of the Total Ceramide Cream is unlike any moisturizer I've used before. It's closest to the pudding-like texture of the Holika Holika Skin & Good Cera Super Cream, but it's slightly stiffer, and a little less sticky. Its appearance is also a bit translucent--not as opaque as a typical cream, but nowhere near as transparent as a typical gel. \n\nI actually had a really difficult time with this moisturizer the first few days, and thought it was going to be a repeat of my Cosrx debacle all over again, where the moisturizer just sat in a greasy layer on top of my face refusing to sink in. I immediately started frantically googling PHAs and dry skin, because I react pretty badly to glycolic acid, and was worried that the maltobionic acid was the culprit keeping my skin from absorbing the moisture. In the end, I decided to stick with it and give the Total Ceramide Cream a slightly longer trial run before calling it quits.\n\n I'm very happy I pushed through though, because on the fourth day, my face finally stopped looking greasy as the cream sunk in and made my skin soft and moisturized. I think the difference is that I let my last hydrating layer dry down a bit more than usual before applying a facial oil or Stratia Liquid Gold followed by the cream. It might have also been just a weird weather-related fluke, but I haven't had any problems since then. This product leaves me thoroughly moisturized, and it's very rare that I need to reapply it throughout the day, which I've had to do with other moisturizers (I'm looking at you, FAB). My skin definitely looks brighter, but I'm skeptical about chalking that up to the maltobionic acid when I've recently seen some really great progress on my acne and PIE with Finacea. So maybe it's the cream, maybe it's the azaleic acid. Either way, I'm just happy the PHA in the cream isn't getting in the way of its moisturizing abilities. \n\nIn terms of texture, there's no sticky residue left on my face, making it appropriate for daytime use. It leaves a dewy finish, which is perfect because I rarely wear complexion makeup but still like a slightly luminous effect. And speaking of foundation, the few times I've used makeup over the Total Ceramide Cream, I've had no issues with pilling. \n\nThere are a few drawbacks: we recently had a cold snap in the UK, and I found that I had to reapply this moisturizer a bit more than I might have with Nivea or Holika Holika. I've also noticed that if I go too heavy on the azaleic acid, it's not quite enough to help with the dryness either. So it's definitely not for extra dry days, but works well for my skin's usual level of dryness. I've also found it very easy to use too much of this product. I'm used to having to apply large amounts of moisturizer on my face to keep the dryness at bay. However, a little bit of this product goes a long way, and I went through like a third of the tube in only two weeks because I didn't realize I could get away with using less. \n\n**Final Thoughts:** Missha Near Skin Total Ceramide Cream is the first moisturizer that I will happily repurchase (rather than begrudgingly repurchasing Nivea Soft *again* because I can't find anything I actually like). My skin feels happy and moisturized using this product, and I love the way it makes my skin look dewy and fresh. \n\nThis is probably not the right moisturizer for you if your skin is very dehydrated or you're dealing with some exceptional dryness. It's also probably not going to be a good option for people with oily skin, given the dewy finish. However, if you have dry to normal skin and are looking to add some ceramides or a PHA to your routine at a relatively modest price point, then I highly recommend Missha Near Skin Total Ceramide Cream. \n\n**My Rating: 4.5/5**",

But ever since getting some high end Western skin care as gifts, I noticed that many of them actually have a lot of fermented/yeasty ingredients in them.\n\nBut I can't find much on the \\~science\\~ or evidence behind why ferments can be good for your skin. But I also wonder, since ferments aren't really a thing that majority of consumers in the Western market are looking out for (like fragrance, rose water, coconut water, rosehip oil, fruit/veggie extracts that have label/experience appeal, but aren't necessarily good for skin), why would these huge companies bother putting ferments in their expensive skin care if they didn't have evidence that they do SOMETHING?\n\nI especially am curious because AB/Korean beauty are sometimes looked down upon as just being trendy and not using ingredients that are scientifically proven to be truly beneficial for skin.\n\nDo you think ferments are legit?

Some retailers have the ingredients list with zinc oxide only, and then the official packaging and website say its a chemical sunscreen (both english and korean), and also, the official packaging also lists fragrance just above carbomer (from the naver posts that i saw), whereas the official korean website ingredients list has fragrance at the bottom of the ingredients list, maybe bc of different ingredients list laws in korea…. lol idk anymore its confusing.",

I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!\n\nIngredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1.** \\[**BEPLAIN\\] Cicaful Ampoule - 4.34/5 (3,174 Reviews)**\n\n30ml/29,000 KRW\n\nCentella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyglycerin-3, Pentylene Glycol, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Sodium Hyalutonate, Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacilius/Rice Ferment, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Xantham Gum, 1,2 Hexanediol, Ethyhexylglycerin.\n\n*The few reviews I have read for this say that it absorbs fast, is pretty soothing, and some people state that it really helped their acne. The expectation seems to be that it's supposedly very good for acne prone skin. There are pictures of someone with pretty bad acne showing before and after pictures of their acne going away. (Korean skin care is more geared toward CALMING & SOOTHING acne than to go to war with it with drying treatments and whatnot. I guess because a large component of acne is inflammation?)* \n\n*Some people said it doesn't seem to do anything for them, sensitive types seems to like it a lot, that it absorbs quickly. They like that it's unfragranced. Some VERY oily types said they feel like their skin is a little bit more oilier when they use it and that it doesn't absorb well for them. It may be really popular due to Director Pi suggesting it as the #1 soothing ampoule in her recent video. I see Director Pi's name pop up quite a lot in reviews in general.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cvm5b0doc8731.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=75f5866f4847487e1271f277ff8db20353b394b0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. \\[BADSKIN\\] Collagen BOMB Hydrating Ampoule - 4.28/5 (5,002 Reviews)**\n\n400ml/24,000 KRW (400ml ampoule??!)\n\nHydrolyzed Collagen, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Water, 1,2 Hexanediol, Trehalose, Carylyl Glycol, Allantoin, Propanediol, Brassica Olearacea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Medicago Sativa (Alfalfa) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Capitata (Cabbage) Leaf Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Brassica Campestris (Rapeseed) Extract, Raphanus Sativus (Radish) Seed Extract, Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hyaluronic Acid.\n\n*Reviews for this basically say that this is ULTRA moisturizing. A little bit on the heavier side so oily skin may not like it, but all the dry skinned people seemed to really, really love this. It's cheap, very hydrating, absorbs well. However, a few oily people said it takes a little bit to sink in for them.*\n\n[BIG](https://preview.redd.it/d2pcet1rc8731.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e4fac533d2f3f52e206e338e85a10c33fc69df5)\n\nB I G\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. \\[Manyo Factory (Witch Factory)\\] Bifida Complex Ampoule - 4.21/5 (5,368 Reviews)**\n\n50ml/35,000 KRW\n\nBifida Ferment Lysate, Lactobacillus/Pumpkin Fruit Ferment Filtrate, Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, Copper Tripeptide-1, Aureobasidium Pullulans Ferment, Panax Ginseng Callus Culture Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Glycerin, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Caffeine, Hydrolyzed Algin, Red Ginseng Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Methyl Gluceth-20, Epigallocatechin Gallate.\n\n*This is a very popular product. This and their Galactomyces Niacin Ampoule have been consistently on #1/somewhere in the top 20 list since their debut in 2012 according to Director Pi. This ampoule has been #1 for like forever from what I'm gleaming. However, their expiry is 2 years unopened, and 6 months opened. Supposedly studies done by Estee Lauder say that bifida ferment has been shown to strengthen your skin barrier over time and make it less sensitive to things. Director Pi says ferments provide very, very gentle form of exfoliation.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/chi00fdvc8731.png?width=470&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a191ba338f59eaa0c66ece19e1e3b5311c87dfa\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. \\[SCINIC\\] First Treatment Essence - 4.16/5 (5,282 Reviews)**\n\n150ml/19,800 KRW\n\nGalactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Adenosine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Water, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rubus Coreanus Fruit Extract, Sea Water, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b08iueb0d8731.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=163f45d2760c17dfc195db29d3e667246a7c272c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. \\[TORRIDEN\\] Dive-in Serum - 4.42/5 (1,127 Reviews)**\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Trehalose, Betaine, Propanediol, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside, Madecassic Acid, Ceramide NP, Beta-Glucan, Malachite Extract, Cholesterol, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, PVM/MA Copolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Xantham Gum, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract.\n\n*This looks like Hada Labo lotions tbh. :o Except with more skin soothing things like panthenol, witch hazel, madecassoside, allantoin and such.

    "body": "Hwahae: It's a review/ranking app for Koreans for beauty-related things. I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!\n\nIngredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm really excited about this section. I'm not happy that Korea is and has been for years, swamped in pollution from the winds carrying it over. There is a lot of microdust and even people with resilient skin reported getting redness & severe irritation from the pollution. Everyone has to wear these giant masks, sometimes special ones, and limit their exposure to the world outside of their homes.*\n\n*So there has been a lot of push for soothing, calming products and \"clean\" ingredients. A lot more focus on repairing the skin barrier. So I'm excited about those, but not the fact that people have to suffer.*\n\n*I'll be bolding some of the soothing, repairing and/or skin-identical ingredients in the ingredient lists. I don't know every good ingredient, but I will bold the ones that I do know of. Some other beneficial ingredients as well.*\n\n*\\*Also got random pictures of the textures of the creams and the users who posted it.*\n\n*If you're interested in barrier repairing/replenishing as I am, here are some good quotes from Susan, from Swift Crafty Monkey blog:*\n\n>**Natural moisturizing factor (NMF)** is found within the corneocytes, and makes up 20% to 30% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum. It **consists of amino acids (40%), sodium PCA (12%), lactate (12%), urea (7%), ions (18.5%), sugars (like glycerol – 8.5%)**, and a few other things. These are water soluble [humectants](https://swiftcraftymonkey.blog/better-crafting-through-chemistry/) (meaning they draw water out of the atmosphere to our skin) that have a huge impact on the biochemical and mechanical properties of our skin. Having an adequate NMF level in our skin can prevent or reduce skin tightness, cracking, scaling, and flaking. It improves our skin’s plasticity (thanks to the interactions of the amino acids with keratin) and helps maintain skin’s barrier properties.  \n>  \n>**Filaggrin** is a really important protein found in our skin! ...When we are in more arid climates, the filaggrin breakdown increases to produce more NMF. More NMF is a good thing!  \n>  \n>The contents of the NMF do more than act as humectants. The lactate and potassium can affect the pH and stiffness of the stratum corneum. The lactic acid stimulates ceramide biosynthesis and improves barrier function. The [hyaluronic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan) (HA – picture to the left) maintains hydration and structural integrity of our skin. It also interacts with intercellular lipids and regulates the mechanical properties of the stratum corneum.  \n>  \n>\\[The strateum corneum lipids\\] make up about 15% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum, and contain about **40% to 50% ceramides, 20% to 25% cholesterol, 15% to 25% fatty acids** (those with C16 to C30 chain lengths, with C24 to C28 being the most common), and **5% to 10% cholesterol sulfate**.  \n>  \n>Oils with **linoleic or gamma-linoleic acid** are always welcomed by our skin (like sunflower, sesame seed, borage, evening primrose, rice bran, and others), especially in the winter.\n\n**Squalane, beeswax, lecithin, lanolin** are also good skin replenishing ingredients. Shea butter is very soothing and moisturizing, as well as having a lot of antioxidants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TOP CREAMS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. \\[Dr. G\\] Red Blemish Clear Soothing Cream - 4.22/5 (9,894 Reviews)**\n\n70ml/36,000 KRW - $31.29\n\nWater (Aqua/Eau), **Glycerin**, Butylene Glycol, C 13-16 Isoparaffin, **Niacinamide**, C 12-14 Isoparaffin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Pentylene Glycol, Vinyl Dimethicone, Caprylyl Methicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Panthenol**, Acrylates/C 10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Tromethamine, **Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate,** Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, **Beta-Glucan, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside,** Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Epigallocatechin Gallate, **Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid.**\n\n*This line from this brand is extremely well-known and popular in Korea.

The price is also right at that point where I'm not sure if I want to give it a shot. How about you guys? Anyone here going to go for this?",

The cream is an opaque white whereas the other sleeping masks are more gel like and translucent. It’s definitely not heavy or suffocating thick cream and it’s surprisingly spreadable and not as dense or oily as expected? I haven’t tried it so I’m useless lol but I hope that was some decent product description. I can’t remember if there’s a scent so probably nothing toooo strong. I have oilier skin so I really don’t use creams until the fall/winter. But I’m excited bc I love cica stuff and yeah Liah did hype it up a bit lol",

    "body": "I vaguely remember signing up for the notification for Charlotte Cho's new launch about a month or so back and received an email about the opening of her new brand, '[Then I Met You](https://thenimetyou.com/),' this morning. While I only looked at Soko Glam during the very beginning of my skincare days, I know it's a popular outlet for a lot of people since it's a convenient, one-stop-shop for a lot of the most popular Asian beauty products. \n\nIt appears that Charlotte Cho wants to dive into the realm of making her own skincare products and the new brand touts a very similar story to a lot of other online-owned brands. Based on the 'Our Story' page, she's focusing on \"**natural, premium ingredients, even when it means cutting into our own margin.\"** (ok, sis).  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe initial launch is a cleansing balm and a cleansing gel sold separately or as a pair. Here's the breakdown:\n\n* LIVING CLEANSING BALM (38.00 USD): **Massage this luxurious, sorbet-soft oil cleanser into the skin to melt away oil-based impurities, such as sunscreen, makeup and excess sebum while nourishing the skin with antioxidants, essential fatty acids and vitamin E.**\n\n>Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Trii-sostearate, PEG-8 Isostearate, Cera Microcristallina (Microcrystalline Wax/Cire Microcristalline), Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Ceresin, Synthetic Wax, Orbiignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Diospyros Kaki Fruit Extract, Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Rosemarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Ethylene/Propylene Copolymer\n\n* SOOTHING TEA CLEANSING GEL (36.00 USD): **This premium gel cleanser with antioxidant and antibacterial properties uses gentle cleansing agents to clear skin of any impurities, without stripping the skin. The mandarin citrus scents are designed to awaken your senses during every use.**\n\n>Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake), Aqua (Water/Eau), Sorbitol, Glycerin, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Diethylhexyl, Sodium Sulfosuccinate, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, 1,2 Hexanediol, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Diglycerin, Potassium Cocoate, Propylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Citrus Reticulata (Tangerine) Peel Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Panthenol, Gluconolactone, Butylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, T-Butyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously, I haven't tried any of them yet but I probably won't be investing in these products. First, neither are fungal acne friendly unfortunately. Second, holy price point batman. They're expensive on their own and together they're 68.00 USD. Also, and this isn't a dig at Charlotte Cho, but the way some of these companies advertise their products as if they're absolutely revolutionary kind of blows my mind and is overdone. Cleansing balms and cleansing gels aren't new and there are only oh-so many ways you can reinvent the wheel. Does anyone else have any initial reactions?",

    "body": "Hello! So beplain initially caught my attention as I’ve heard the brand was made based on customer feedback in Korea. The ingredients list for these products are relatively simple so there was little worry for breakouts. It definitely did not disappoint!\n\nA little background: I live in a humid country with dehydrated, combination, acne-prone skin. My main concerns with my skin right now is CCs, calming and hydrating.\n\n-\n**Greenful pH-Balanced Cleansing Foam** ***4.5/5 MRP***\n\n*Glycerin, Mung Bean Extract, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Lauryl Betaine, Betaine, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Extract, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phaseolus Radiatus Seed Powder, Dextrin, Allantoin, Water, Ceramide NP, Green Tea Powder, Ethylhexylglycerin*\n\nCompared to all cleansers I’ve used so far, this was probably one of the best. It’s a pretty light green with a thick paste texture, and has small bits of what seems to be mung bean. In my opinion, you can smell mung bean, just slightly, but I didn’t mind it at all as it reminds me of those asian dessert places haha. The cleanser itself foams, but for me it wasn’t stripping at all. The cleanser contains lots of extracts which could be good for the skin, but honestly since it’s a wash-off product, I couldnt feel any of the benefits :”) The downside would be the price. In my country, it is sold for $12 for 80ml, which is more expensive than any other cleansers I’ve ever used :(\n\n-\n**Chamomile pH-Balanced Toner** ***3.5/5 WNRP***\n\n*Chamomile Flower Extract (80.65%), Propanediol, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Trehalose, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Betaine, Butylene Glycol, Allantoin, Cellulose Gum, Disodium EDTA, Ceramide-NP, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin*\n\nOkay so this was a 3.5 for me, just because of my skin type and the weather in my country. For oily-combo skin in humid weather, this toner felt slightly too moisturizing, so it felt kind of heavy for me. This would definitely be amazing for dry skin in the summer or oily skin in the winter. It’s a runny toner with a slight slip if you rub it against your hands. I could smell a bit of the chamomile as I apply it to my face but it wasn’t overpowering at all. It was soothing, but the main thing it did for my skin was honestly the moisturizing/hydrating component. If that was what you’re looking for in a runny toner, I’d definitely recommend this!\n\n-\n**Cicaful ampoule** ***4.5/5 WRP***\n\n*Centella Asiatica Extract (81.44%), Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyglycerin-3, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Tromethamine, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylate/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Hydroxyacetophenone*\n\nI understand you probably are sick with all the cica products dominating the market, but this ampoule was *really good* for me. This ampoule is clear and very viscous, almost like a gel but still relatively runny. As you rub it on your skin it becomes like water, and sinks in reaaally quick. I’ve heard people say this was hydrating for them, but it wasn’t *that* hydrating for me. The calming effect was *amazing* though—redness in my face can minimize as soon as a few hours after application. It felt cooling and very soothing to the skin. Though I would say I run out of the bottle relatively quicker than other serums haha. If you need a calming, no fuss ampoule with minimal ingredients and low breakout risk, this is definitely one to try out!\n\n-\n**Chamomile pH-Balanced Lotion** ***3/5 WNRP***\n\n*Chamomile Flower Extract, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Ethylhexyl Stearate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Kelp Extract, Eclipta Prostrata Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Acmella Oleracea Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Purified Water, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Butylene Glycol, Squalane (Plant-derived), Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Fructooligosaccharides, Beta-Glucan, Allantoin, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide-NP, Sodium hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Pentylene Glycol*\n\nCompared to other lotions/emulsions I’ve tried, I don’t think I prefer this one. This lotion was a bit thick and holds it’s shape better when you try making it run down. It has the chamomile smell similar to the toner, but far more minimal that you really can’t smell it unless you’re trying to. It’s very moisturizing, probably enough if you use this as a moisturizer in the summer. It spreads well and you don’t need a lot to cover your entire face, but it sinks in less quick, so after using it, it feels like you’ve put a legit cream moisturizer on your face. This was *not* a bad product, but it’s probably better geared towards those with dry skin.\n\n-\n**Hyaluronic Aqua Moisturizer** ***4/5 WRP***\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Methyl Trimethicone, Methylpropanediol, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP, Copolymer, Raffinose, Betaine, Sodium Hyaluronate (100ppm), Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid (100ppm), Allantoin, Madecassoide, Beta-glucan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ethylcellulose, Butylene Glycol Cocoate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Polyquaternium-51*\n\nRight off the bat, the texture surprised me. This came out as a translucent balm-like gel with no scent, like a less strong vaseline, so for those with dehydrated skin, this one is for you! I was kinda scared using it thinking it was going to be heavy, but I have been using it at night and it’s done wonders for my skin the next morning. Perhaps because my skin is dehydrated, but with this product, my skin texture really improved. As this also was not like a very emollient moisturizer, it felt like it was a layer sealing in all the serum and toner I used before and did not feel clogging at all. Honestly, this product turned out faaaaaar better than I expected!\n\n-\n\nOverall I am really impressed with the brand. None of their products broke me out, which is incredible! All in all I’d say I recommend the cleanser and the cica ampoule for all skin types, the chamomile line for dry skin types (or combo/oily in the winter) and the aqua moisturizer for dehydrated skin. I hope this review was helpful for you and have a great day!",

Angry zits calm down and get smaller a lot faster.\n\nThe chamomile toner is moisturizing just enough for my oily skin this winter, but I can see how it can feel heavy and too moisturizing in humid climates.

    "body": "Hi guys! Long time lurker here, finally decided to post my first review! A little background about my skin: I have combination skin, leaning towards oily (especially during these summer months). I've been using this sub as a guide in my quest to \"perfect\" my routine. While the journey was quite expensive, I've learned that my skin tends to react that a number of common ingredients (most AHAs and BHAs are too harsh for me, coconut oil and most of derivatives, niacinamide, essential oils, high concentrations of hyaluronic acid). I was getting frustrated as I just needed a perfectly effective and safe toner for my nitpicky skin. Lo and behold--\n\n**TONER**: **ANUA Heartleaf 77% Soothing Toner**\n\nWhile this might not be popular on this sub, it seems to be well loved in Korea (EXO's Suho is known to use this toner, I've also come across a few youtubers who swore by it). Heartleaf or Houttuynia Cordata Extract has been a rising ingredient lately. It's known to soothe sensitive skin, protect the skin from external irritations, and maintain oil-moisture balance.\n\n***Does it live up to its claims?*** Yes. After using this toner for 2.5 weeks, I've noticed that my skin texture is smoother after weeks of mask acne. I've been developing constant ccs due to the trapped humidity and heat of the mask around my jaw, but this toner has calmed down a lot of my irritation and texture. The consistency is very watery, so I often put 2-3 layers and I've found that my skin has been generally more resilient throughout the day (less redness, less oil). Most youtubers seem to use it for toner masking, which I will soon try! It does seem to be more soothing than hydrating, but hydrating nonetheless. I find myself waking up to completely replenished skin when I pair it with my SIDMOOL Royal Honey Peptide Deep Moisture Pack. This toner has reached HG status.\n\n***Any cons?*** It is quite pricey at $26.00 for 250 ml, some sites even have it listed as $30-45. I personally find it worth it, as I've tried too many to count that did not work for me (PKY, soonjung, cezanne, hada labo, kiku). It is also less accessible, but I know yesstyle recently started carrying their whole line and for the cheapest available price!\n\n*Full List of Ingredients:*\n\n*Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Panthenol, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract,* ***Butylene Glycol***\\*, Vitex Agnus-Castus Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Phellinus Linteus Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Fruit Extract, Malus Domestica Fruit Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Isopentyldiol, Methylpropanediol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Disodium EDTA\\*\n\nThe ingredients are very clean-- as reiterated throughout their branding. Unless you have an allergy to any of the extracts, or an extreme sensitivity to butylene glycol (which I sometimes do have, but this toner seems to work as butylene is farther down the list), I can't see it wreaking havoc on most skin. Perhaps, the worst case is it does nothing. YMMV of course (!!), but I've never been so impressed with a product that I've been compelled to post about it. Sensitive skin girls, unite! Thank you for reaching the bottom of this page. <3",

Hope it works as well as the naturals line. I used to try a new brand every few weeks but lately I have been too lazy. \n\nBtw, folks using the naturals radiant volume may want to check out jet.com.

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

    "body": "**I hate buying sunscreen.** Outside of a few gel-like sunscreens which I can never find for a reasonable cost, most just disappoint me. I feel like I often have to choose between having the complexion of a sad day, or looking **so** greasy.\n\nMy skin ranges from light-medium to medium-dark. To visualize: I'm Doja Cat when it's cold out and Kerry Washington once I can get some sun - strong golden tones. I tan fast, with or without SPF (though I am very pro-SPF), and have burned exactly once in my entire lifetime. I'm still not interested in putting myself at risk for skin cancer.\n\nI'm not going to claim that this sunscreen will not leave a white cast on people with deeper and darker skin-tones than my own, though I truly hope it works for you. So... here's my review!\n\n**Banana Boat: Light as Air, 50+ SPF UVA/UVB Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Lotion**\n\n* **Price**: $5.99 on sale at Kroger, regularly $10.99 here.\n* **Size**: 6 oz. ($0.99/oz. on sale, regularly $1.83/oz.)\n* **Scented**? Yes, it's pretty noticeable at first but fades (not completely). I'm VERY sensitive to scents (I can't wear perfumes, they trigger migraines), but it's not the usual *Eau de Banana Boat* I expected.\n* **White cast?** None on my skin tone. Absolutely none. It's decently liquid-y for the SPF, and if you apply it more liberally, it can be rubbed in and absorbs fairly quickly.\n* **Greasy**? NOPE. It's not one of those slick sunscreens. Alcohol is the fifth sunscreen, and I'm no scientist, but I suspect this may contribute to it.\n* **Pilling**? None. I tried applying more and more to dare it to pill, it didn't! Usually, sunscreen will build up and 'highlight' my hair follicles/stubble (I have hairy arms and can't be bothered to shave regularly) - didn't happen!\n* **Ingredients**: Water, Diisopropyl Adipate, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Tapioca Starch, Acrylates/C12-22 Alkyl Methacrylate Copolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Coco-Glucoside, Chlorphenesin, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, Fragrance, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice.\n\nI read a lot of reviews on here and think \"Yeah, can't relate!\" since a lot of sunscreens with 50+ SPF have white casts, and many AB sunscreens are either intentionally white cast-y or, worse, pink-tinted, which are both a no for me. \n\nI hope this block of text helps another medium-skinned beaut who has been walking around intermittently looking like a tombstone and/or bacon grease. Feel free to ask any questions, I haven't seen much about this sunscreen before, and I've been trying it out for a while now :).",

I saw this when it first came out and at the time there was nothing on it online and figured I'd let others be the guinea pig. I've been looking for a chemical sunscreen for my face. I myself am white but obviously not enough because the white cast looks horrible, especially if I haven't shaved. And the tinted sunscreens are great, but then their too dark and it can make for some uncomfortable looks out in public. Plus, they cost more per ounce and require more care in application. But then most chemical sunscreens aren't as safe for sensitive, acne prone skin like myself. Several of the supposedly sensitive ones I saw today at Target still had oxybenzone and other irritating ingredients. But this one didn't. So yeah-thanks for the heads up. I'm hopeful about it now!",

    "body": "This was my first time using a non-Western sunscreen and I don't think I can come back to that ever again. I already tried a Purito product that worked well for me so I was pretty excited about their new unscented version of the sunscreen. The consitency of the sunscreen is very similar (if not the same) as a light moisturizer. It applied very nicely and was pretty hydrating. I didn't seem to experience any pilling when applied over my other skincare products, so if you do apply makeup over this sunscreen you'd probably be safe. After applying, it left no whitecast (I have a lighter skintone with yellow undertones) or any greasy residue on my face. Most sunscreens I wear leave a gross sunscreen smell on my skin, but as advertised this one left no scent. It also doesn't contain any essential oils like its counterpart, so anyone sensitive skin would have a safer time trying out this version. I would recommend this sunscreen and would purchase it again for myself. If anyone has a question, feel free to ask :)\n\nIngredients:\nWater,Butylene Glycol, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Glycerin,Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate,Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Acrylates Copolymer, Silica,1,2-Hexanediol, Niacinamide,Dibutyl Adipate,Ethylhexyl Triazone,Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Cetearyl Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Sorbitan Olivate, Glyceryl Stearate, Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Sorbitan Stearate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Disodium EDTA, Adenosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopherol",

    "body": "Review Day 1/7\nI recently purchased most of the new acne line by Pyunkang yul and I'm pleasantly surprised.\nUnlike the minimal ingredients the other lines have has these products contain a whole list of beneficial ingredients such as Centella Asiatica, Licorice Root extract, Niacinamide, a peptide complex as well as many more. The star ingredients for this line is white willow Extract and Forsythia fruit extract. \n\nPyunkang Yul ACNE Toner:\nIt's very watery so great for those with oily skin. It absorbs pretty quickly and has a sweet scent despite it not having any essential oils. After two weeks of using it I prefer the essence toner to it but it did help with the breakout I had and helped with clearing out my pores but it's not hydrating enough for me to see using in the long term. \n\nPyunkang Yul ACNE Facial Cleanser:\nMade with almost the exact same stuff but includes Citric acid and other agents for cleansing the skin. I'm not going to lie I love the cleanser it's so gentle and uses micro bubble technology. You might be disappointed that it doesn't lather well but I don't really care abut that aspect. It's a thicker consistency than their ato cleanser and 500ml cleanser but thinner than the foaming cleanser and has a pH of 5.5-6. My friend tested the pH on her one and she got a pH of almost 5.8. It also doesn't strip me of any moisture i feel more hydrated after cleansing. I'll definitely repurchase when I run out i prefer it over the Cosrx salicylic acid cleanser or my cereve hydrating cleanser. \n\nPyunkang Yul ACNE Spot Cream:\nI got this for my sister but tried some myself I didn't really notice any difference on my skin but my sister who has sensitive acne prone skin saw improvements on her acne. I prefer to my a'pieu pimple patches over it. \n\nThis line is perfect for acne prone sensitive skin while people like me that has combo- dry skin might not like it as much it. \n\nEdit (I think their listed on cosdna if you want to check what is what) : Ingredients for the cleanser\nWater Cocamidopropyl Betaine Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate PEG-75 Acrylates Copolymer Glycerin Disodium cocoamphodipropionate PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate Dimethyl Sulfone Pyridoxine HCl Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract Forsythia Suspensa Fruit Extract Butylene Glycol Centella Asiatica Extract Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract Sodium Chloride Copper Tripeptide-1 Allantoin Citric acid Potassium Hydroxide Sodium Benzoate Phenoxyethanol Disodium EDTA\n\nIngredients for the toner:\nWater Butylene Glycol Dimethyl Sulfone Pyridoxine HCl Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract Niacinamide Forsythia Suspensa Fruit Extract Centella Asiatica Extract Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract Copper Tripeptide-1 Glycerin Hydroxyacetophenone Myrtus Communis Extract Tropaeolum majus Extract Ethylhexylglycerin Disodium EDTA\n\nSpot cream ingredients \n\nWater Pentylene Glycol Glycerin Behenyl Alcohol Cetearyl Alcohol Niacinamide Glyceryl Stearate Dimethyl Sulfone Silica Polyacrylate-13 Polyisobutene Polysorbate 20 Allantoin Madecassoside Asiaticoside Panthenol Pyridoxine HCl Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract Xanthan Gum Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer Forsythia Suspensa Fruit Extract Butylene Glycol Centella Asiatica Extract Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract Copper Tripeptide-1 Hydroxyacetophenone Myrtus Communis Extract Tropaeolum majus Extract Ethylhexylglycerin Disodium EDTA\n\n*For the cleanser and toner everything has an EWG rating lower than 3 these are all available in sale on style korean for $10 USD and under (shipping was dreadful to Canada its probably good if you live in the US) \n\nEdit x2? I just saw it on yesstyle too and they are doing a sale on the products as well . To clarify i broke out by using the moisture cream from this brand I added those products plus olivarrier products to sooth my skin. I'm planning on reviewing that brand later this week \n",

I'm not supposed to divulge all these details! \n\n**Product reviews** :\n\n*Note* : None of these products have been used by me on a strictly daily basis, except for a week (or two) in a row during vacations, as I rarely step out of the house (lockdown, duh!) and don't apply sunscreen indoors (\\*gaasp\\* 😨)   \n Rest assured, I've reapplied some when out, and have used them on and off in a span of 6 months. \n\nFrom L-R \n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/s2C99g0N/IMG-20211119-184403.jpg\n\n\n**1-  Nivea Sun Protect And Moisture, moisturising sun and collagen protection SPF 50+ PA++++** \n\n**Quantity** **- Price** : 125 ml - ₹495 MRP\n\n(bought on Amazon for ₹396)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua, Octocrylene, Glycerin, Titanium Dioxide, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Alcohol Denat, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Panthenol, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Myristyl Myristate, Silica, Cetyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Stearyl Alcohol, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Methylparaben, Dimethicone, Trisodium EDTA, Ethylparaben, Sodium Citrate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citric Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hydroxide, Linalool, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Eugenol, Coumarin, Methyl Benzoate, Benzoic Acid, BHT, Parfum/Fragrance\n\n**Texture** : White - Chalky Color. Medium - Thick Consistency   \n , you have to rub it in for a while for it to get completely absorbed, medium drying speed. Kinda greasy, semi matte finish. Leaves a moderate white cast, not a ghastly one though. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. Smells mostly of Alcohol! (it's one of the ingredients, so obviously..), fragrance is definitely not unnoticeable, but I don't mind it for my body, lingers around for a while. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : Hell yeah! It won't wear off unless you bathe, it survives water splashes and friction from clothes. Be careful while applying it on your feet though, I slip a lot while walking, esp when there's a rush and I put on sandals right after applying it. Give it ample time to dry before stepping out. \n\n**Reapplication** : Since the lotion sits thick on the skin, reapplication is not a bliss, the white cast becomes more noticeable after reapplication, and if you sweat after, oh god it feels a heavy /sticky mess lol, also tends to attract dust, but it's for the body, so I can compromise. 🤷‍♀️\n\n**Overall experience** : It's the best body sunscreen I've tried so far, with the highest protection and I think the brand can be trusted for its spf claims. \n\nI tried using it on my face once, oh nooo, I will never do that again! it kept moving around and just wouldn't get absorbed, plus it stung like hell because of the alcohol, and I literally felt like I was applying fevicol!   \n For my body, yep a thumbs up! \n\n\\*But\\*, if you get acne on your arms  (my arms have a tendency to break out / get textured if I use the wrong product) it wouldn't be the best choice, it seals and chokes the pores, I'd prefer something lighter. I usually wear tops/suits with long sleeves, so not much of the arm is exposed. below the elbow it feels comfortable enough. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WRP**, Hit! (for the body) \n\n**2- Iba Halal Invisible Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++**   \n **Quantity - Price** : 80 ml - ₹395 MRP\n\n(I bought it on Amazon for ₹ 337)\n\n**Ingredients** : WATER CONTAINING EXTRACTS OF ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) EXTRACT & HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) WATER, WATER & ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE & BENZOPHENONE-3 & BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE & PHOSPHOLIPIDS & 1,3-BUTYLENE GLYCOL & PHENOXYETHANOL, GLYCERINE, AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/BEHENETH-25 METHACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL AND TRIETHYLENE GLYCOL, ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE, ALUMINIUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE, NIACINAMIDE (VITAMIN B3), TITANIUM DIOXIDE, PERFUME, DISODIUM EDTA, SODIUM HYDROXIDE\n\n**Texture** : White color. Light lotion - cream consistency, very lightweight and water like, kind of runny, it trickles down when you place a dallop on the palm and tilt it.   \n The Best consistency of a sunscreen I've used so far! Not at all heavy, takes some time to dry, esp when using larger amounts (I use 2-3 finger lengths) and still it doesn't feel too much on my face, easy to work with, requires a lot of gentle massaging because it's watery and takes some time to dry and settle in. High dry time.   \n It contains no silicones! My oily skin loves it! Doesn't give a matte finish though, on the glossy (satin?) side, but nothing bothersome.  \n Doesn't leave a white cast! On the Low I'd say, because of the presence of Titanium Dioxide. Absolutely love the texture. Skin feels very hydrated and plump and non greasy. (taaza nikhaar 😆) \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Has a \"fresh\" smell, (bamboo room freshener? idk something like that), moderate level, doesn't linger a lot. I haven't found a \\*good\\* fragrance free budget (\\*my\\* budget) friendly sunscreen yet. So I'm okay with this for now. Sometimes I'm guilty of enjoying the fragrance 😅 because all other products I use are strictly fragrance free. \n\n**Water Resistant?** :  Nope, doesn't survive water splashes or sweat (it won't come off completely in a single splash though, will wash off when sweating profusely) white colored droplets roll down the face if out in the sun for long. (the survival time is slightly more than the La Shield urban protection mineral sunscreen gel though) \n\n**Reapplication** : Breezy! Since it's lightweight, although, you might experience some moving around if there's a \\*lot\\* of product, I'd suggest applying pea by pea instead of taking a finger length at one go, I squeezed out a good amount once while in the car and kept massaging it in for a couple minutes (or more) and felt embarrassed at the weird looks my family and people outside the car gave me.. So yeah.. lol.  It doesn't feel uncomfortable after layers have been built up. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I love it! Although I'm not sure if the sunscreen has undergone the required tests to justify the actual sun protection claims, but that's all I got so far, it fits my requirements of no silicones, negligible white cast, high declared protection, non oily texture, and most importantly budget! \n\nOne important point, it stings when used after physical / chemical exfoliation. So you may want to avoid it after threading / waxing / scrubbing / masking / exfoliating.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Hit! **WRP** (for face) \n\n**3- La Shield Pollution Protect Mineral Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹280 MRP\n\n(bought it on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Purified Water, Octinoxate, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Caprylyl Methicone, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Diisopropyl Adipate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetearyl Alcohol, Brassica Campestris/Aleurites Fordi Oil Copolymer, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Phenoxyethanol, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, C20-22 Alcohols, Isohexadecane, Fragrances, Aluminium Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 60, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trolamine, Disodium Edetate, Sorbitan Isostearate\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Light - Medium gel - cream consistency. Lightweight. Doesn't require a lot of rubbing in. Doesn't move around a lot. Leaves a Low- Moderate white cast. Not the kind typical to mineral sunscreens, but more than the Iba Halal sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Lingers.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Naah, it melts away almost instantly if you happen to sweat while applying it, just a spray (accidental rain drop for example) on the face and it wears off from that spot, minor sweating and it rolls down the cheeks, doesn't adhere to the skin. \n\n**Reapplication** : Medium ease. Moves around, kind of sticky when built up. Medium White cast (visibly noticeable) after reapplication. \n\n**Overall Experience** : Um, I had expected a better performance from this one, looking at the ingredients and all, but it stings around the eyes, and on the face, makes my face somewhat tacky, my face becomes oily by afternoon (if applied in the morning). Personally I didn't like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Miss. **WNRP**.\n\n**4-  La Shield Fisico Matte Sunscreen Gel SPF 50+ PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹630 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹441)\n\n**Ingredients** : Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate\n\n**Texture** : White color, pasty. Very thick, \\*very\\* silicone-y (it's silicone based.. So), chokes the skin, spreadability is good, doesn't require a lot of massaging in, quick dry time. Moderate - slightly high white cast. Makes my face sweat! \n\n**Fragrance** : No. Silicone like.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Definitely. Strong staying power. Survives sweating and water splashes too well. Requires double cleanse or a heavy duty face wash to remove. \n\n**Reapplication** : Hahaha! Go ahead and try it if you want to look like a freshly frosted cake! Don't even \\*think\\* about it. Unless you plan to scare people with your literal white walker look. Been there, done that. I'm forever terrified, and will \\*never\\* do it again.\n\n**Overall Experience** : It's a thick paste, Stings around the eyes, which was surprising it being a physical sunscreen (probably because the zinc is micronized? idk) Reapplication is painful, can't apply more than 2 pea sized amount in the first application. Attracts dirt, Chokes my pores, I can't afford to apply something so pore clogging and then strip my facial skin away to remove it.   \n For me, it's not worth the price performance wise.   \n I'm finishing it off as a primer for occasions, smoothes out the face surface, my face gleamed during diwali :P\n\n**Repurchase status** : Miss! **WNRP**.\n\n**5- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Mineral Sunscreen, SPF 50+ PA++++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹295 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹236)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Silica, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Sodium Chloride, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Perfume, Magnesium Sulphate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Thick cream. Low - medium effort required for blending in the skin. Doesn't move around a lot. Medium - High Dry time. Low white cast (for a mineral sunscreen), medium matte finish. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : No, doesn't survive low- medium sweating. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I haven't used this sunscreen much. My mom used it a few times, and the moment I saw it melting down her face I didn't want to use it. Could have been a great affordable mineral sunscreen, but it's not even mildly water resistant, so I instantly passed on it. Might give it a try in the future. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WNRP**. \n\n**6- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Sunblock and Anti Tan Lotion Tinted Sunscreen, SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 60 ml - ₹245 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water,Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Propylene Glycol, Glyceryl Monostearate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Kaolin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Sodium Sulfite, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Extract, Saxifraga Sarmentosa Extract, Acetyl Tyrosine, Arbutin, Glutathione, Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dimethiconol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, Perfume, Disodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ci 77492, Ci 77491, Ci 77499\n\n**Texture** : Orange color (literally). Medium consistency lotion like. Lightweight. Medium matte finish. Easy application. Doesn't require much effort to blend in. But the color is a literal disaster, it's impossible to apply a full finger length of this sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. On the Higher side. \n\n**Water Resistant** : Maybe a bit more than the mineral sunscreen variant? Not sure, rubs off on the mask \\*very\\* readily. Haven't noticed orange sweat yet, maybe because I haven't worn it enough. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. But I'm pretty sure it's not possible provided the intense color. \n\n**Overall Experience** : It could have been a good,  affordable tinted sunscreen, but the tint is just a disaster.. It dulls my face overall, and it doesn't even work as a bb cream (or sorts) although I don't expect to provide any coverage as per se (which it doesn't anyhow), but I can't find a way to finish it off other than applying it on my hands. Maybe color corrector?? Omg what'd I just come up with 😃💡. Let's see lol \n\n**Repurchase status** : Nope. **WNRP**. \n\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/RVccCB01/IMG-20211119-173651.jpg\n\n**7-** **Malibu LipCare Balm, SPF 30, UVA/UVB** (watermelon variant) \n\n**Quantity - Price** : 5 gm - ₹249-₹299\n\n(bought 2 on amazon for ₹199 each )\n\n**Ingredients** (watermelon) : Petrolatum, Paraffinum Liquidum (Mineral Oil), Paraffin Wax, Ozokerite Wax, Homosalate, Octocrylene, Carnauba Wax, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Flavor  \n May Contain: Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Citral, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol\n\n**Texture** : Ultra Rich, stiff stick, application is not smooth and breezy, tugs and pulls on the lips if you rush it, tightly press it against the surface, let the balm melt and glide on slowly. Makes lips very soft though. Staying power is great! \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Watermelon. Strong. \n\n**Taste** : Bitter Af! Avoid applying it on the insides and corners to keep it from seeping in. \n\n**Water resistant?** : Definitely! Survives liquids (tea, water, juice for me) not very heavy meals. Apply a thick layer to fight the mask rubbing off. Stays on for hours, afternoon - evening, for example. Keeps lips very soft and supple, no stinging sensation. \n\n**Overall Experience** : The only lip balm with spf 30 (plus uva/uvb protection) that has all the ingredients disclosed. Can't ask for more.   \n The only issue is, I can't use it with my waterproof /transferproof matte lipsticks. It makes them water loving and easily transferable, need to figure something out for that.. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : Unless I find some other lip balm with spf 30 mentioning all the ingredients, in a more affordable range, with no bitter taste, and better sunscreen filters. I **WRP** this. \n\nThats about it! Congrats for making it this far! Thanks!\n\n*Edited to add links to images, since I couldn't upload them with the post*",

And I have combination skin so not particularly dry in first place.

    "body": "Today's random TJ Maxx haul at a new TJ Maxx I randomly stopped by. Prices are in USA\n\nPhotos 2, 3, 4 are from today's TJ Maxx in Long Beach, CA. Photos 5 and 6 are from an Orang County, CA TJ Maxx. Stores are clean and organized.\n\nHAUL and mini review: (dry/dehydrating/30/Socal)\n\n**Laneige cica sleeping mask $20 60 mL**. My ride or die cica cream that I always need to have in stock. I ran out in March and was gonna buy more on my Japan trip, but couldnt find it in Japan. I didnt really wanna deal with the shipping and tariffs mess with online retailers so I intended to buy it whenever theres a sale at my local Amorepacific/Aritaum store. Regular price is $34, I was hoping to snag it on a 30% sale for \\~ $25, but TJ Maxx selling it for $20 is fantastic. Even Stylevana only has it on sale for $24 right now. I was devastated that this TJ only has 1 in stock. \n\nMini review: Nothing soothes my skin the way this cica cream does it, especially on hotter days. Its my fall back whenever my skin acts up. 10/10. Have been repurchasing for 5 years I think.\n\nIngredients: Water, Propanediol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Squalane, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Glycerin, Panthenol, Cetearylalcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, 1,2-hexanediol, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Hydroxyethylacrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Tauratecopolymer, Butylene Glycol, Acrylates/C10-30alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Glyceryl Caprylate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium EDTA, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Sorbitan Isostearate, Asiatic Acid, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Aureobasidium Pullulans Ferment, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Cymbopogon Martini (Palmarosa) Oil, Tocopherol\n\n**Parnell  cicamanu cotton clear pad $5 90 pads.** This was a clearance item. I didnt even know Parnell sells skincare. I thought they're a makeup company that focuses on cushions. Just checked Stylevana, its being sold for $18.\n\nIngredients: Water, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, C12-14 Pareth-12, Glycereth-26, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Glyceryl Caprylate, Betaine, Allantoin, Trehalose, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Leptospermum Scoparium Leaf Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Honey Extract, Gluconolactone, Ceramide NP, Anastatica Hierochuntica Extract, Lactobacillus Ferment, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Madecassoside, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Disodium EDTA\n\n**Dr. Jart Ceramidin cream $25 30mL + 50mL**. Have not tried. The Dr. Jart cica cream is a thin gel that was too thin for my dry skin so Im hoping this ceramidin cream is thicker. Currently $30 for 50 ML on Yesstyle.\n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dipropylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Methyl Trimethicone, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dicaprylyl Ether, Cetearyl Olivate, Panthenol, Glyceryl Stearate, Behenyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Olivate, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Extract, 2,3-Butanediol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Ceramide NP(2,070ppm), Ceramide NG(2,070ppm), Ceramide NS(2,070ppm), Ceramide AS(2,070ppm), Ceramide AP(529ppm), Cholesterol, Pentaerythrityl Distearate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cellulose Gum, Dextrin, Glyceryl Polymethacrylate, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Oil, Citronellol, Tocopherol, Tartrazine\n\n**S.Nature Aqua Squalane Moisturzing Cream $10 60 mL.** Have not tried. Currently $20 on Yesstyle. Interested in trying because the ingredients look good for this price. New brand to me.\n\nIngredients: Water, Squalane (150,000ppm), Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Betaine, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Adenosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Arginine, Allantoin, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Glucose, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n**Sulwhasoo Perfecting Cushion $25 for 2.** Crazy good deal. Its usually $65 for 2. I know its on sale because this is the old version and the new version in store is that ugly boring orange packaging. Got it for my aunt.\n\nAt this point, Im going to TJ Maxx every other day. Its my form of stress release. Thank goodness the deals are reasonable. ",

Apart from some Neutrogena products and No7 Beautiful Skin Blemish Defence Serum, they contain \"alcohol denat.\", which is a dealbreaker for me as I try to avoid drying alcohols as much as I can. \n\nBHAs are few and very far in between, in addition to not being labelled as such and most probably without the percentage of salicylic acid contained or whether it's in the right pH to be effective. \n\nI haven't done a price comparison, and since I found them in Boots I've used the online site's price point.

While I could see the improvements, it would feel like my skin was burning. I'm not sure if it's due to the age of the bottle, or just the ingredients, but I discontinued use.\n\nThen I bought *Boots Skin Clear Deep Cleansing Lotion* which is exactly the same as the Blackhead version just with an extra word on the front. It feels just like[ L'Occitaine's Shea Butter Toner](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8adf20777.html) that's alcohol free, but a month in and I don't really feel like it's doing anything.\n\nI used to use Neutrogena a lot and I really liked their grapefruit range, but the *Neutrogena VISIBLY CLEAR Pink Grapefruit Oil-Free Moisturiser* stopped being effective far too quickly. It goes on really light which I like, but after a while my skin either feels dry, or really oily. I felt it was super hit and miss.\n\nWith the Neutrogena Visibly Clear Spot Stress Control Hydrating Spot Treatment, is that just on acne, do you put it on under moisturiser or as a moisturiser?",

Reviewing FormulaRX Barrier Relief Moisturiser\n \n* Texture and consistency:  It sinks right in the skin and has a gel like texture. It doesn’t feel heavy nor makes me sweat on application unlike other moisturisers make me do. I loved the fact it’s so lightweight and has the gel consistency.\n\n* Effect/ Result: to be very honest, when I first started using this moisturiser, I felt like it was breaking me out, at one point I even stopped using the moisturiser for a while because I was just upset. I loved the texture so much but had been doubting if it’s breaking me out. But later I realised it wasn’t the moisturiser, it was just my usual hormonal acne. I’ve been using it for 2 months and lately it has been working just fine. \n\n• It has 4% niacinamide, confirmed with brand. I had thought of using it as an alternative to a niacinamide serum, but didn’t show any added visible effects.\n\n* Would not repurchase because: \n1. The price, 699 for a 50 g basic moisturiser?!?!\n2. It does it’s job, moisturises my face. Nothing exceptional about it and honestly the Minimalist moisturiser does the same thing for a lesser price.\n3. It makes my face extremely oily and greasy in an hour. My face looks extremely dull. I wouldn’t use it in day time.\n\n•PROS.\nThe thing I love the most about this moisturiser is its consistency and lightweight feature but then the fact it makes my face oily AF is a bummer :(\n\nCute packaging: I’m a sucker for pastel colours and aesthetics and gohd I love the tube in my skincare cabinet, looks so pretty ✨\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS \nLike I’ve been mentioning again and again, I really wanted to love this moisturiser but the price point and lack of any exceptional feature wouldn’t make me purchase it again. \n\nMinimalist Sepicalm 3% + Oat Moisturizer\n\nReview Type: RAVE\n\nPrice: Rs. 345-349 for 50 g\n\nUsage Time: 4 Months, every night and sometimes day too\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Squalane, Glycerine, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Sodium Cocoyl Aminoacids, Sarcosine, Potassium Aspartate, Magnesium Aspartate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Avena Sativa (Oat Kernel) Flour, Sodium Polyglutamate, Undecane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Tocopherol Acetate, Arginine, Glycine, Alanine, Histidine, Sodium Lactate, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Tridecane, Aluminium Starch Octenylsuccinate, Trehalose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n* It has a creamy texture and is quite a thick moisturiser for an extremely oily skin person like me.\n\n* It does not have any actives and I can layer it on top on any active I use, is the fact I love this moisturiser.\n\n* It is decently priced, would definitely repurchase it. \n\n* I’ve used it under makeup and it has worked wonders since the makeup didn’t cause any breakout or any dryness or flakiness.\n\n* I’ve been using it since July, taking a pea sized amount every-night and still have almost 3/5 left, a little goes a long way for me which makes it super affordable. \n\n* I think it’s safe for me to call it my HG moisturiser. It has never broken me out or caused any CCs or any another issue.\n* Literally soothed me, I had been using pulp vit C earlier which was quite strong and potent, Sepicalm moisturiser came handy every time\n\nCONS\n* it’s thick and greasy\n\n* Does not sink in skin immediately unlike the FormulaRX one. It sits on skin for a while\n\n* Makes me sweat after application \n\n* Cannot use it in day (except under makeup)\n\nWhy do I still use it\n- No matter what texture it has, it has soothed my acne, vit C burn, and improved overall skin texture.\n\n- I love the price point \n\n- I use it at night so I don’t worry about how I look, all I care is how well it works. And it does work for me!\n\nI know we’ve missed detailed reviews on this sub here so here’s one from me, more coming in!\nHope y’all find it helpful :)",

Not the $8 Korean retail price, but still, it seems really worth it to me considering the amazing ingredients.\n\nPanthenol is especially really underrated but it seriously kicks ass for dry & sensitive skin/tret face like mine (make sure it's at least 5% tho to be most effective). I love the Aveeno Eczema Therapy Cream bc it's so moisturizing & healing, but it PILLS LIKE CRAZY. Grrrrrrr. And it's a litttle sticky. Otherwise, it would be perfect.\n\n(Also, if you have super tret face/super dry skin, urea is very much worth looking into. It's super underrated as well. It's probably one of the most scientifically proven to be effective dry skin ingredients, but it's not marketed in the US for whatever reason. Maybe bc people think it's from \"urine\"? That's obviously not where they get it in skin care products lol, which is why education is so important. \n\nThe Eucerin 5% Urea face cream is the most accessible one I have found, but there's also Balea? Sebamed, Numis, Medisei Panthenol Extra (also 5% panthenol, but may be clogging) from Greece, Bioturm - all 5% urea creams, for those outside the US. I don't suggest going above 5%, as it can be exfoliating and I personally have those to be really heavy/greasy.",

    "body": "**TL;DR: Don't fuck up like me. Make sure your moisturizer, primer, and foundation all have the same base or you will regret it.** \n\nOk, I know that this topic has come up a lot recently, but I feel like a lot of discussions leave out a key part of the problem. By now, I think most people know that you have to make sure your primer and foundation have the same base i.e. are they water based or silicone based. It makes sense since those two are layered one on top of the other and if they're immiscible then the foundation will just settle on top and come off on everything, defeating the purpose of a primer. Now, what I haven't seen discussed is how your moisturizer may be interacting with your primer and foundation. I've discovered some interesting things through trial and error recently and wanted to share it with the MUA community.\n\nFirst, I recently switched moisturizers. My skin has been a disaster this winter and I needed a major skincare overhaul. I have sensitive skin and Neutrogena has always had my back with great products that don't irritate my skin. One of the new things I got was a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, the [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/hydro+boost+water+gel.do?sortby=ourPicks). I love this product because it absorbs quickly, eliminated my dry spots, and hasn't caused any irritation. What I didn't take into account when I bought this product was the ingredients list; I was just happy to find a non-irritating hyaluronic acid delivery system. \n\nwater, **dimethicone**, glycerin, **dimeticone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer**, phenoxyethanol, polyacrylamide, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, dimethiconol, C13-14 isoparaffin, **dimethicone crosspolymer**, chlorphenesin, carbomer, laureth-7, sodium hyaluronate, ethylhexylglycerin, fragrance, C12-14 pareth-12, sodium hydroxide, blue 1 \n\nThe bolded ingredients indicate it's a silicone-based primer. Yes, the first ingredient is water, but the silicone is present in large amounts, and it interacts differently with water-based products.\n\nMistake 1: I was going for a low-effort look one day and decided to used some of my face powder and call it good. With face powder I usually wear my [NYX HD Primer](http://www.nyxcosmetics.com/high-definition-primer/NYX_180.html) because it's lighter but still holds the powder in place. That day my makeup was slipping and sliding everywhere and I looked like a cakey hot mess when I got home. I checked the ingredients on my moisturizer, found all the silicone, then looked at the primer ingredients. \n\n**Water/Aqua/Eau,** Propylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Diethylhexyl Maleate, Glycerin, Ethylene/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Dimethicone, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, PEG-15 Glyceryl Isostearate, Trihydroxystearin, Adipic Acid/Neopentyl Glycol Crosspolymer, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Tocopheryl Acetate, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax/Cera Carnauba/Cire de Carnauba, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7, Silica, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin,  Propylene Glycol Stearate, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Laurate, Propylene Glycol Laurate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Butylene Glycol, Salicornia Herbacea Extract, Copper Tripeptide-1,  Chlorphenesin, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, VP/VA Copolymer, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, C12-14 Pareth-7, Amodimethicone,  Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance/Parfum, Citronellol, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. MAY CONTAIN / PEUT CONTENIR (+/-): Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Zinc Oxide (CI 77947), Chromium Hydroxide Green (CI 77289), Ultramarines (CI 77007).\n\nThe water-based primer just sat on top of my moisturizer, making my makeup come off all over everything.\n\nMistake 2: I somehow spaced and forgot all about my moisturizer issues and yesterday I was rushing to leave and decided to just throw on some Sonia Kashuk Radiant Tinted Moisturizer and go. Wrong move. I had already washed my face and moisturized previously, so the Neutrogena moisturizers was under the tinted moisturizer. As I was rubbing the tinted moisturizer on my face, it started to ball up and look disgusting. I quickly wiped it off and left bare faced, but later I looked at the ingredients in the Sonia Kashuk Tinted Moisturizer. \n\nFluorphlogopite, Sorbitan Is Os Tearate,\nTris Iloxane, D Is Teardimonium Hectorite,\nCetyl Peg/Ppg‐10/1 D Imethicone,\nD Imethicone Cros S Polymer, Butylene Glycol,\nSilica D Imethyl Silylate, Synthetic Bees Wax,\nTetras Odium Ed Ta, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium\nChloride, Alcohol, Talc, Peg‐30\nD Ipolyhydroxys Tearate, Aluminum\nHydroxide, Potas S Ium Sorbate, Stearic Acid,\nCaprylyl Methicone, As Corbyl Palmitate,\nTocopherol, Pentaerythrityl Tetra‐Di‐T‐Butyl\nHydroxyhydrocinnamate.\nMay Contain: Mica, Titanium D Ioxide, Iron\nOxides , Zinc Oxide.\n\nThis one is a little more tricky, as it does have some dimethicone ingredients, but my best guess is that the other ingredients react negatively with the ingredients in the Neutrogena moisturizer.\n \nNow, I know this sounds like using the Neutrogena moisturizer is too much of a pain, but it's really not that big of a deal. My favorite primer, the [ELF Poreless Face Primer](http://www.elfcosmetics.com/p/poreless-face-primer?dept=face-faceprimer), works perfectly with this moisturizer and my HG foundation, [Revlon Colorstay Whipped](http://www.revlon.com/products/face/foundation-makeup/revlon-colorstay-whipped-creme-makeup#309971347054||0), goes on better than ever. I just wanted to make this post to inform people that mismatched moisturizer can cause just as many issues as mismatched primer and foundation!",

Virgin hair, never been chemically treated, I don't do any heat styling, no blow-drying. Only Air-drying\n\n[Pic 1, Im turning away from camera](https://imgur.com/a/3YQDuew.jpg). Hair is so hard so photograph properly, If I get more accurate pictures, I'll edit to add.\n\nSo life's pretty bad right now, so I'm not able to do the elaborate hair care routine I used to. Nowadays, I don't even get time to oil my hair and if you've read any of my old posts, I'd have mentioned how I never ever wash my hair without oiling. But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This is an anti-dandruff shampoo and the best I've used so far.\n\nOther than the usual supermarket brands I've used Bioderma Node Ds (Excellent but pricey. Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles. Bottle looks super tiny and the plastic waste bothers me.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Re'equil Anti-Hairfall Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:   [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-c14-16-olefin-sulfonate), [Cocamidopropyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-hydroxysultaine), [Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-cocoyl-isethionate), [Decyl Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/decyl-glucoside), [Coco-Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/coco-glucoside), [Dexpanthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Glyceryl Oleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-oleate), [Biotin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/biotin), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Nasturtium Officinale Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/nasturtium-officinale-extract), [Tropaeolum Majus Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tropaeolum-majus-extract), [Polyquaternium-22](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-22), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Glycol Monostearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycol-stearate), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Methylchloroisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylchloroisothiazolinone), [Methylisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylisothiazolinone), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Ci 45100](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-45100), [Ci 42090](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-42090)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.450 for 250 ml.

Normal shampoo consistency\n\nUsage:  I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: Oh my god, you guys. Best find of this year. This gives super shiny, sleek looking hair. I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember. I used up the entire bottle. I think 9ish months?? or more.\n\nConsistency: Normal shampoo consistency, HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above. Forever Repurchase. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Oriental Botanics Red Onion Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients: This has an ingredients list a mile long. Will update soon.\n\nPrice: MRP 449 for 300 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years and I'm only done with half the bottle\n\nConsistency: Normal Shampoo\n\nUsage: I take a lot and apply it from shoulders to ends, if I've not oiled my hair.\n\nReview: I literally had to go and check what the name of this product was to type this review and I've been using it for 2+ years. I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

Was MRP 490 for 500 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years. I'm on my second tub\n\nConsistency: White cream.\n\nUsage: I take one big spoonful, add it to half a mug of water, swirl it around till it mixes with the water, dip my hair in and leave it. I'm not sure why this works since leaving hair in water isn't good, but it does. Between just straight up applying it and doing this, this works better. I leave it on for 5 minutes and then rinse it off.\n\nReview: This is a cult favourite  around here and for very good reason. I use this in the place of a conditioner. This conditions. I get nice, shiny frizz free hair. The cost - benefit was insane and this was HG. Not going to say anything else, because it's not available and it's pointless.  I paid higher than MRP to get my hands on a tub, when I realised it was going to be rEfORmuLAted and I've had no regrets so far.

Plum has a 100 million sales throughout. You can get it for around 450ish.\n\nUsage Timeline: No clue. I'm on my third tub.\n\nConsistency: Thick white cream\n\nUsage: This works both ways. Straight up applying and mixing it with water, both works equally well. You might use up more if straight up applying it.\n\nReview: This is brilliant protein conditioner. If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

I may or may not have been keeping a weather eye on upcoming SPF releases ever since Director Ahn In-Sook mentioned in passing in a video that many cosmeceutical brands have either put a stopper on releasing new sunscreens or postponed the release of those awaiting completion to better the formula and ensure they're up to snuff, thus there will be a slew of SPF releases come March. ~~Heaven forfend we suffer the wrath of deadly solar lasers cuz finding The One is nothing short of a bluidy struggle.~~\n\nWhat I've noted in these new releases was a combination of robust formulas and new filters. *Exciting!* I've already translated the INCI lists and entered them into Incidecoder & Cosdna.

I'm pretty sure these are all  the same base sunscreen with the same protection. I would get the sunscreen with the simplest ingredient list and whichever one is cheapest. The About Me Be Clean seems to be alcohol and fragrance-free (non sure if rosemary leaf oil is an essential oil and fragrant??). I would probably go with the Innifree though because I prefer alcohol in my sunscreen, otherwise they are too too dewy and greasy looking, and the ingredient list is rather simple. If only it didn't have fragrance, but I can compromise with that. The Dr. G has too many unnecessary ingredients and many comedogenic ingredients like myristic acid, so I would stay away from it.",

    "body": "Nitong nakaraang mga araw may isang Tiktok content creator ang inulan ng comments sa kanyang Tiktok page dahil diumano sa hindi magandang paraan o istilo ng pagrereview ng sunscreen na ito. Dahil dito , naisipan kong bilhin at subukan itong sunscreen na ito. \n\nUna sa lahat, binili ko itong sunscreen na ito sa tingin kong official store nitong Worada sunscreen na ito. Ito yung store na may Worada din sa pangalan. Dito din sa store na ito binili nung content creator na binanggit ko kanina. Yung B1T1 na yung binili ko, yung isa sa usage test, yung isa naman e sa gagawin kong test sa lab. May kasama din pala itong freebie na Whitening Antiperspirant and Deodorant Cream (isusunod ko itong i-review). \n\nSimulan ko muna sa packaging. Yung packaging nito ay 50 g Cosmetic Pouch with spout. Ito ay gawa sa BOPP/VMPET/LLDPE/Aluminum Foil na sinadya para maprotektahan ng husto ang laman na sunscreen. Ito yung isa sa mga usual na material na ginagamit sa paggawa ng mga cosmetic pouch. Makikita din sa packaging na gawa pala ang Worada Sunscreen sa China. \n\nHindi ko nakita sa packaging ng sunscreen na ito yung mandatory warning para sa mga sunscreen na dapat present sa mga sunscreen products na binebenta sa ASEAN: Do not stay too long under the sun, even when using a cosmetic product. \n\nSa paggamit naman. Pagkabukas ko pa lang ng sachet nitong Worada sunscreen, naamoy ko na agad yung fragrance nito. Amoy milky floral ang fragrance na ginamit dito. Ang laman na sunscreen ay isang cream na off-white na may hint ng dilaw ang kulay (mas maputi ng kaunti sa evap na gatas). Kapag inilagay na sa daliri, nagbe-break na agad ang emulsion at nagiging matubig o runny, kagaya nung sa video review. Noong ipinahid ko ang 2-finger lengths nitong sunscreen, una kong napansin e masyadong maputi yung sunscreen para sa skin tone ko. Tinagalan ko na ang pagbe-blend nito sa buong mukha at leeg ko, pero sa huli halata pa din ang whitecast. Nasabihan pa nga ako ng kasama ko sa lab na nagsusumigaw yung sunscreen ko sa mukha. \n\nNgayon sa ingredients naman. Ito ang ingredients nitong Worada sunscreen:\n\nMilk, Aqua, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Titanium Dioxide, Glycereth-26, Potassium Laurel Phosphate, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Isohexadecane, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polysorbate-80, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Niacinamide, Trehalose, Tocopheryl Acetate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA, Parfum\n\nUnahin na natin ang UV-Filters. May tatlo na UV-Filters ang Worada Sunscreen:\n\n* Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (UVB) \n\n* Ethylhexyl Salicylate (UVB) \n\n* Titanium Dioxide (UVB) \n\nBabalikan ko ito mamaya para mai-relate sa product claim nitong sunscreen. \n\nAng pinakaunang ingredient sa IL nito ay Milk. Maling entry na naman. Lac (Milk) ang tamang INCI name kung naglagay ng gatas as ingredient. \n\nRelated naman ang gatas sa susunod kong punto. Gumamit ng Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, at Propylparaben itong sunscreen na ito bilang preservative system. Angkop itong preservative system na ito, dahil ang taas ng ginamit na Milk sa formulation na ito. Nararapat lang na broad spectrum preservative system ang gamitin. \n\nPreservative Efficacy:\n\nParabens: Yeast and molds; Gram(+) bacteria\n\nPhenoxyethanol: Yeast and molds; Gram(-) bacteria\n\nRegarding sa safety ng parabens (methyl, propyl), approved for use pa yan ng regulatory bodies ng ASEAN at EU, basta masunod lang ang maximum allowed concentration. Pakitingnan na lang sa pic yung statement ng SCCS, ang committee na inaatasan ng EU na magsagawa ng safety assessments ng mga ingredients kagaya ng parabens. Pero kung isa ka sa mga nakakaranas ng contact dermatitis dahil sa pagiging sensitive ng iyong balat sa parabens, mabuting iwasan na lang ang mga produktong gumagamit nitong mga preservatives na ito. \n\nSunod, may laman naman itong mga ingredients na moisturizing sa balat: \n\n* Glycerin (humectant) \n\n* Trehalose (humectant) \n\nPara naman sa whitening:\n* Milk\n\n* Niacinamide\n\nMay antioxidant din: Tocopheryl Acetate\n\nSunod nating tingnan ang product claims ng Worada sunscreen:\n\n* SPF 60 PA+++ UVA-UVB Protection\n\n* Invisible\n\n* Waterproof\n\n* Sweat Resistant\n\n* Lsolate Skin (nasa harap, di ko naintindihan kung anuman ito) \n\n* Whitening\n\n* Moisturizing\n\nSa SPF claim, hindi ko mawari kung papaano nasabi ng brand na ito na may UVA protection ito, samantalang yung tatlong UV-filter nito e puro UVB protection ang kayang ibigay. Dagdag pa, wala pa akong nakikitang SPF test report para sa Worada sunscreen na ipinakita ng brand owner sa kanilang soc med accounts. Kung meron man, makikicomment na lang sa baba. \n\nSa claim na invisible, hindi naman invisible e. Kitang kitanang white cast e. \n\nSa water proof claim, hindi pwede ang water proof claim. Water resistance ang tamang ilagay jan. At kailangang may patunay na tinest ito, kesyo ito ay 40 min or 80 min water resistance. Ganoon din sa sweat resistance. May test din para jan, either 40 min o 80 min, kagaya ng water resistance. \n\nYung Lsolate Skin na claim na nasa harapan, malay ko jan. Kailangang i-clarify ng brand owner yan. \n\nSa claim na moisturizing at whitening, meron namang ingredients na laman ang sunscreen para masabi kahit papano na pasok ang claim nila. Ang concern ko lang e yung paggamit ng Milk. Matumal ang mga studies kung sa nakakapagpaputi ang gatas. Tapos, takaw-mikrobyo pa yan. Mabuti na nga lang, ginamitan ng broad spectrum preservative system. Pero kung mahina ang preservative system nito, madaling masisira ang product na ito. \n\nFinal words:\n\nMarami akong concerns na nakita sa product na ito. Una na jan yung kung SPF-tested ba talaga ito. Pangalawa yung claim na may UVA protection, pero malabo base sa mga UV filters na ginamit. Ikatlo, yung mga unallowed (water proof) at unsupported (water resistant at sweat resistant) claims. Yang tatlo na yan, major red flags na agad dahil hindi tama na magki-claim para sa product na hindi pa naman nagtetest. Palaging tandaan, sa mga product claims, laging dapat may kaakibat yan na substantiation. Kasi napakadali gumawa ng product claims, ang mahirap e patunayan kung tunay ba talaga yan. Performance-wise, hindi para sa akin itong sunscreen na ito, dahil ayoko ng whitecast. \n\nAbangan ang Part 2 para sa mga isasagawa kong mga test sa lab. \n\nAyun lang. Salamat sa pagbasa. \n",

        "body": "The \"Bio-Protein Care and infused with Glutamic Amino Serum\" is not doing anything in the formula except giving their marketing people something to talk about.\n\nThe shampoo is also not having much effect on frizz as the only ingredients that might last through rinse-off include the Guar (cationic polymer) and maybe the dimethiconol (silicone).  Although in reality, the dimethiconol mostly gets rinsed away too.\n\nIn the conditioner, the ingredients that are having the greatest impact include the Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Dimethiconol/Silsesquioxane Copolymer, and Behentrimonium Chloride.\n\nThese are all ingredients you can find in other formulas. \n\nThe idea that the smoothing performance is unlike anything on the market is debatable. There are likely lots of products that can give you the smoothing effect of these products. However, using a combination of very good formulas (these are), an appealing fragrance, and solid marketing, you can come to believe it is the best you've ever used.  Just know that you haven't used everything and there are lots of products that you would be happy with if only you could test them on a blinded basis.",

Last time I used it, I applied way more than I needed on my hair, and that’s the only thing that got me to see a difference from the last few times I used it. My hair definitely felt smooth and conditioned(a bit on the heavier side), but it was no better than the results I’ve gotten with my loreal dream lengths conditioner. This is just an interesting anecdote, but the people that I HAVE seen rave about this intensive repair conditioner are usually people with chemical damage from bleaching. I have never bleached my hair in my life. I would say my biggest concern is maybe mechanical and heat damage on virgin hair. That’s pretty much it. You’re likely seeing good results with it because it has good conditioning ingredients and the formula that your hair likes.",

I really dove into ‘Best Mineral Sunscreens For Dark Skin” videos/posts and ended up purchasing a number of recommendations. The CoTZ Flawless Complexion Tinted Sunscreen came up a few times. So, I grabbed that along with their Sensitive Non-Tinted Sunscreen.\n\nBoth products are 100% mineral based sunscreens with 20% Zinc Oxide as the UV protector. The tinted version contains Mica and Iron Oxides for color but outside of that the formulations are nearly identical. Various silicones, preservatives, and texturizes make the list for both products.\n\nCoTZ focuses on mineral based sunscreens that are relatively “clean” and suitable for sensitive skin. No dyes, fragrance, or essential oils are here which is nice to see (and a nice change from the potpourri bowl that is Supergoop!). The brand name itself stands for Contains Only Titanium Zinc…a nod to the focus on physical SPF.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/er2a827mmbc51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=03a682918bc1a5e6fca56553c0f80811ed71ed0c\n\nBoth sunscreens have a rather thick/creamy texture that in turn applies a bit heavy as well. But, this heaviness absorbs down within a couple of minutes with a “residue” that I don’t have an issue with. Those that have kept up with my reviews (LOL) know that I really like that K-Beauty glow/near shiny look. These sunscreens from CoTZ provide that for sure without being greasy (for me).\n\nBut aside from the application and feel…the white cast (or lack of) from these mineral sunscreens is really what sets them apart. The very minimal white cast from the non-tinted version and the total lack of white cast from the tinted is something I have not experienced from a Zinc Oxide based product before. Seriously…I was ready to grab every other SPF in my stash and give it all away. “This is all I need for the rest of my life!” I thought LOL!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qm8hmunmbc51.jpg?width=2316&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0981a2fd35f82b034386bb64e24973b9264ef8d\n\nThe Sensitive Non-Tinted Sunscreen does start to show its mineral roots after a few layers throughout the day (especially when exercising/sweating). But still, the white cast is minimal compared to other products I have used. As for the Flawless Complexion Tinted Sunscreen…I could just layer and layer that stuff on. I think this particular tint is just a really, really good match to my skin tone. It totally masks any white cast and disappears into my skin. CoTZ isn’t kidding with their “Vanishing Zinc Oxide” marketing.\n\nI won’t throw out my other sunscreens just yet LOL…and will keep testing/reviewing mineral sunscreens from brands like Australian Gold, Elta MD, and Versed. Hopefully there will be some more winners in the bunch but for now I am happy to say I have found my new favorite sunscreen brand. The tinted version would be my overall go-to but with the tint liking to transfer to my face masks…I find myself reaching for the non-tinted version just as often.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jwzwmadpmbc51.jpg?width=2316&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a59f1d13f6e5e23331ac0775bed47c48cfe860b\n\nHonestly, I think anyone who has struggled with finding a decent mineral sunscreen should give these a try. My only hesitations in recommending them would be if you have particularly oily skin, need something that can stand up to a good workout, or really prefer a matte finish SPF. These two products will range from dewy to rather heavy depending on your skin type and neither really “dry-down” all the way. CoTZ makes some primer/matte style sunscreens and I am tempted to give them a go.\n\nI’m so happy to have stumbled across these two sunscreens as they were a much needed reprieve from Supergoop! (not everything has been a miss so far from that brand…but most everything LOL). Part of me wishes I would have invested in the entire CoTZ product range and reviewed that vs. Supergoop!…ah well.\n\nNeedless to say I’ll be keeping a couple of bottles of CoTZ sunscreens in my stash going forward. \n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nSensitive Skin Non-Tinted Sunscreen: **Active Ingredients:** Zinc Oxide 20% **Purpose:** Sunscreen **Inactive Ingredients:** C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Cetyl PEG/PPG 10/1 Dimethicone, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Disodium EDTA, Glycerin, Hydrogen Dimethicone, Microcrystalline Wax, PEG-10 Dimethicone, PEG-30 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Chloride, Stearyl Dimethicone, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Water\n\nFlawless Complexion Tinted Sunscreen: **Active Ingredients:** Zinc Oxide 20% **Purpose:** Sunscreen **Inactive Ingredients:** Bismuth Oxychloride, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Cetyl PEG/PPG 10/1 Dimethicone, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Disodium EDTA, Glycerin, Hydrogen Dimethicone, Iron Oxides, Mica, Microcrystalline Wax, PEG-10 Dimethicone, PEG-30 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Chloride, Stearyl Dimethicone, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Water\n\nWhere To Buy (Link To CoTZ Site - Prices Vary Depending On Product/Size): [https://cotzskincare.com/mineral-sunscreens/](https://cotzskincare.com/mineral-sunscreens/)",

    "body": "So I spotted the above-named product at the grocery store while meandering past the grooming section.  I picked it up and wondered if it was as good for a primer, as it's neighbor, Nivea Post Shave Balm, has been known to be.  I compared the two products' ingredient lists, and noticed some big differences.\n\n> **Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm**: Water, Glycerin, Isopropyl Palmitate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Bark/Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tapioca Starch, Triceteareth-4 Phosphate, Maltodextrin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol , Piroctone Olamine, Fragrance.\n\n> **Dove Men+Care Post Shave Balm Hydrating+**: Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 MA Crosspolymer, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, DMDM Hydantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Stearic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Panthenol, Sodium Lactate, Triethanolamine, Sodium PCA, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Ceramide 3, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Ceramide 6 II, Ceramide 1\n\nThe first thing that jumped out at me was the inclusion of silicone compounds in the Dove shave balm.  It contains cyclopentasiloxane and dimethicone.  Silicones are absent from the Nivea balm.  This is a pro or a con, depending on your skin type and the base of your foundation.  \n\nThe second thing I noticed that I liked was the inclusion of ceramides in the Dove balm.  However, they're mostly on the tail end of the list, so it's hard to say how much is actually in the products, and if it is present enough to do any good.  Certainly can't hurt.\n\nThe Nivea balm has the benefit of having tapioca starch in it's formulation, which can be good for oil, and it has Witch Hazel extract.  Both balms have pretty good ingredients.  Neither contains drying alcohol.\n\nSo I purchased it.  When I got home, I washed my face, moisturized as normal, then put the Dove balm on the left side of my face and the Nivea balm on the right side.  I eschewed all other primers.  I dabbed a little Maybelline FitMe concealer under my eyes, and used a RT sponge to apply some L'Oreal Infallible Pro-Matte.  The foundation went on very smoothly and did not cake up or pill.  I set it with NYC loose powder.  I added some blush and bronzer for some depth, then I went about my day.\n\nSix hours later, I surveyed the first round of results.  Aside from my foundation being rubbed off of the tip and bottom of my nose (got the flu), both sides looked okay.  I did noticed, however, that the foundation on the right side of my face was more textured.  I could see my pores way clearer than the other side of my face.  Both sides were moderately oily.  The left side of my face was holding up somewhat better than the right side.  I noticed fewer flakes around the dry spots of my face on the left side.  At eight hours, all of these observations were more pronounced.  I noticed more oil on the right side, enough that my pores were \"shining\" with oil.  It was odd.  Neither side looked bad, however.  But for me, the left side (Dove) was winning out in the overall appearance category.  \n\nSo, for my initial testing, Dove Men+Care Post Shave Balm Hydrating did better than Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm, as a foundation primer.  Both have pretty good ingredients, both are alcohol free, and each can serve certain skin types better than the other.  Cheers! ",

Let’s say there’s an ingredient in a shampoo that doesn’t “mix” well with the bonding treatment, but you wouldn’t know until after you use it a few times(and the change could be mistaken for thinking the olaplex treatment is wearing off it wasn’t worth it, etc. when the shampoo is the actual culprit).\n\n4. If you get an olaplex treatment, but do not use the shampoo and conditioner...it’ll be okay, but it will be much better if you do use it.\n\n5.

    "body": "This isn't a new product (to me or the sub) but I rarely see it talked about, so I figured I would give it a review. I've been using this cleansing oil on and off for about 18 months.\n\n**Skin type:** I'm in my 30s, and my skin is generally oily (formerly dehydrated/oily), but has recently become a lot more dry due to the dry winter weather and prescription tretinoin use. My primary skin concerns run a wide gamut - I'm focused on anti-aging because of my age, but I also have acne, clogged pores, PIH, and melasma. My skin is very, very clog prone. Basically, my skin is a \"special snowflake\" that thinks the world should tremble in fear.\n\n**Location/weather:** I live in the Mid-Atlantic area of the US, so the weather is hot and humid in the summer, and cold and dry in the winter.\n\n**Other first cleansers I have tried:**\n\n* Heimish All Clean Balm\n* LJH Dr's Care Cleansing Oil\n* Whamisa Organic Flowers Cleansing Oil\n\nI have also, in the past, tried traditional OCM with mineral oil. It did not go well (lots of clogs), and in general, I now try to avoid cleansing oils with mineral oil in them, hence why I haven't tried some of the more popular cleansing oils on this sub. The LJH Dr's Care also contains mineral oil, and also didn't go over well with my skin.\n\nAnyway, onto the actual review.\n\n**Ingredients (copied from Ulta.com):** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Peg-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Peg-10 Isostearate, Bis-Ethoxydiglycol Cyclohexane 1,4-Dicarboxylate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Water, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Black Sugar Extract, Sodium Pca, Betaine, Threonine, Sorbitol, Proline, Lysine, Lepidium Meyenii Root Extract, Glutamic Acid, Arginine, Alanine, Butylene Glycol, Cholesterol, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Serine, Glycine, Alcohol Denat., Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake), Hydrogenated Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Ceramide Np, Sarcodon Aspratus Extract, Sucrose, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium Edta.\n\n**Price:** This oil cleanser is easily found on tons of websites. I most often buy from Amazon, and pay about $14-15 USD for a 200mL bottle.\n\n**Smell:** This oil smells *strongly* of lemon, with the faint hint of sugar. The smell is very noticeable on application, but once the cleanser is rinsed off, it dissipates completely. I happen to like the smell, but others may find it a little too reminiscent of Lemon Pledge.\n\n**Texture:** This cleansing oil seems rather thin - it seems to be slightly thinner and less viscous than vegetable oil. Sometimes this is annoying, as I have to use a little more oil than I'd like to really massage my face well without pulling my skin (3 pumps or so).\n\n**Cleansing Power:** In my opinion, this oil cleanser does a fantastic job with face makeup and sunscreen. It does not excel with waterproof eyeliner and mascara - it will remove some but not all waterproof eye makeup. I, however, do not like to use this on my eyes. I wear contact lenses and it always causes them to get milky, making it difficult to see. The cloudy residue lasts several hours. I do not know if this would impact someone who doesn't wear contacts. However, with face makeup and sunscreen, as well as with some superficial clogs, this oil cleanser does a great job. I sometimes, but not routinely, feel grits coming out of my skin. It does not help break up deeper clogs or closed-head blemishes.\n\n**Emulsification:** This stuff turns pretty darned white when mixed with water. I make sure to rinse all traces of it off my face so I don't see any of the cleanser, especially near my hairline. It emulsifies and rinses off easily, and doesn't leave any feeling of residue on my face. I always follow with a second cleanser, but I do not feel a film or greasiness with this cleanser. It also doesn't make my skin feel tight or dry - just clean.\n\n**Overall:** I really like this cleanser and have repurchased it many times. At the price point, it does what I need it to do. It breaks down the face makeup (Mac Studio Fix Fluid or Estee Lauder Double wear, topped with Innisfree powder) and my sunscreen (La Roche Posay Ultra Fluid). It rinses cleanly, and it is inexpensive and easy to find. I don't expect **any** cleanser to address aging concerns, or to meaningfully use acids. Any claims of brightening from a cleanser are probably worthless, since the product isn't on your face long enough to do any meaningful chemical exfoliation. This cleanser is best at what it does not do: it doesn't create new acne for me and it doesn't irritate my skin.\n\nIt is probably not my favorite of all oil cleansers. Right now that would be Whamisa, which is great, but expensive, and which also doesn't seem to penetrate pores as deeply as the Skinfood cleanser. Skinfood Black Sugar Perfect Cleansing Oil is a great choice that I will probably continue to buy it, especially since it's easy to get in the United States. I think it's an excellent pick for a first cleanser that isn't based on mineral oil, but only if you are not sensitive to fragrances.",

I think people are \"desensitized\" to the marketing/labeling w/r/t percentages of acids because of the Ordinary pushing their dumb MAX PERCENTAGE MINIMUM PH nonsense, but I bet this will be a nice starter acid toner, an alternative to something like the Pixi Glow Tonic with a bit MORE oomph (as the pH is lower.) I personally might try it out as an alternative to my CosRX AHA/BHA Toner (although they are not the same and the CosRX is more like the Pixi in that its more inert/less active.) I do already use a 14% glycolic product several days a week, so not sure if I want to put my money in another product that uses glycolic alone. I am excited by the yeast extract- I love everything with yeast. \n\nAlso so excited that neither product contains niacinamide, though I'm sure whatever she makes next will have it!",

    "body": "My foray into skincare began around July last year when I decided I wasn't happy with my skin and wanted to do something about it. Initially I researched foundations, but none of the products I tried evened my skin to my satisfaction, which is when I found /r/SkincareAddiction. Here, I learned that my skin was dehydrated, more than likely due to using Dove bar soap and BP on my face and zero moisturizer every day. :) My skin has changed so much since I started and I am finally ready to review some products I have been using and maybe help others find their way.  \n**Disclaimer** This is my first Reddit text post, I'm really hoping the formatting turns out the way I anticipated.  \n\n**Where we started:**  \n* 25/F/FL; combo/oily dehydrated skin with mild acne, some PIE, sporadic CCs and occasionally painful nodules usually on my forehead, chin, or temples. Noteworthy: I have been on oral contraceptives since I was a teenager and switched to Skyla in 2015. I don't believe my acne is hormonal, but since I've always had some sort of hormonal birth control it's hard to tell how much it has affected my skin.  \n\n\n* No real routine, just washing my face with bar soap in the (scalding hot) shower, using a Neutrogena BP mask to annihilate acne. I was under the (false) impression that since my face was oily I certainly wouldn't want to add moisturizer!  \n\n\n* Mostly concerned with the nodules I was getting because they were big and painful and took forever to heal. Admittedly, I am a skin picker and just recently I realized this is probably the cause of the nodules because the two that I have dealt with recently developed in spots that I had messed with just a few days before.  \n\n\n**Level one: Build a routine.**  \n* At this point, I read everything. EVERYTHING. I spent a couple of months just researching products, learning about skin types, and poring through threads on SCA. I put down the BP mask and bought Neutrogena foaming face wash and CeraVe PM. This was around September when Irma hit and I was without power for a few days, but still managed to keep my fledgling routine. \\o/\n\n* Unfortunately, I felt that CeraVe PM was contributing to a new outbreak of whiteheads around my mouth, where I don't normally get whiteheads. I wound up replacing it with Peach Slices Citrus Honey Aqua Glow which I LOVE. More on that later.\n\n* I also incorporated Neutrogena Sheer Touch sunscreen around this time, but that gave me small breakouts as well and I just didn't like the way that it sat on my skin so I decided to put sunscreen on hold while I did more research.\n\n* While incorporating these products into my routine I tried my best to follow SCA's advice and start slow, one product at a time, and patch test first. I don't really feel that patch testing helped me determine if a product would break me out, as I wouldn't notice any difference in the area I patch tested but then within a few days of trying a new product on my whole face I would see an increase in whiteheads in strange areas. It sucked, but it's alright since the breakouts were mild and didn't take long to appear so I knew fairly quickly that a product wasn't working for me. I still recommend patch testing for sensitivity purposes.\n\n**Level 2: Sunscreen and acids.**  \n* Finally, after months of reading, I felt ready to take on an acid. I settled on CosRX BHA Blackhead Power liquid because it was purportedly more mild (and less expensive!) than other options and I felt that I should start gentle. I picked this up from Ulta in early December and used it every three days for 4 weeks. During that period I don't feel like I had a purge; I kind of expected my acne to go into overdrive but it didn't really get any worse. After the 4 weeks I started using it MWF. \n\n* I also bought Skinfood's Aloe Watery Sun Water Gel from Amazon, but shipping took about a month so I was able to incorporate it well after the BHA.\n\n**Level 3: Skincare God.**  \n* *Just kidding.* So here we are in mid April and I have repurchased the Neutrogena cleanser once (although I switched to hydrating instead of foaming), Peach Slices moisturizer three (!!!) times, Skinfood sunscreen once, and am 1/3 of the way through the CosRX BHA. Let me tell you, I am SO much happier with my skin. \n\n* My skin is more bright and even and I have had much fewer blemishes than I used to, which I would attribute equally to a marked decrease in picking. Taking better care of my skin and working towards a goal makes it easier to keep myself from messing up my progress, although I still have setbacks during times when I am very stressed out, but I try not to let that discourage me.\n\n* Oil production WAS down, but a couple of weeks ago I tried to incorporate Cosrx Ultimate Moisturizing Honey Overnight Mask at night for added hydration, but it wound up drying me out? Additionally, I am running dangerously low on Peach Slices Moisturizer and could not find it at any of my local CVS locations so I have been rationing it while I wait for more to come in the mail. :'( \n\n* From here, I want to try to find a more hydrating cream for nighttime and an easily accessible drugstore sunscreen because currently it takes the Skinfood 2-4 weeks to come in so I have to make sure I order it in advance. I also REALLY want to try Krave Beauty Kale-lalu-yAHA, but I am waiting until I get back from vacation next month before I incorporate a new exfoliant. Finally, someone talk me out of buying something from the Dr Jart Cicapair line because I'm not quite sure what it's for but I really want it.\n\nI hope this will be helpful for those still figuring out what works for their skin, as I know I felt completely overwhelmed when I first started. I am still interested in experimenting with new products but I feel that I have a really solid routine as it is so I am content to wait until I am in a better situation financially to mix things up.\n\n**Current routine**  \nAM: splash with water  \nPeach Slices moisturizer  \nSkinfood sunscreen  \n\nPM: cleanse with Neutrogena  \nCosRX BHA MWF  \nPeach Slices moisturizer  \nSometimes a sheet mask when I'm feeling fancy (I really like Ariul Seven Days masks)  \nVaseline (not so much lately after I read a thread here about Vaseline potentially trapping bacteria if your face isn't cleansed properly)\n\n**Reviews**  \n* Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser: Not much to say here, but from what I have read that is good to say about a cleanser. It took a little time to get used to not having that tight, \"squeaky clean\" feeling that I got using the foaming cleanser, but ultimately I think this has been better for my skin. I have had my eye on Glossier's Milky Jelly cleanser for MONTHS but I can't bring myself to buy it when I am pretty satisfied with how this has been for my skin.\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Glucoside, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol*\n\n* Peach Slices Citrus Honey Aqua Glow: Light gel formula, sinks into my skin really well. I am still a bit oily toward the end of the day, but I have kind of resigned myself to the fact that that may not fully go away. Maybe when I start incorporating a more hydrating night cream it will help. Either way the slight oil doesn't bother me much and I really like this moisturizer.\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Polysorbate 60, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Honey Extract, Ceramide NP, Sorbitan Stearate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Isohexadecane, Tromethamine, Hydroxyacetophenone, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Polysorbate 80, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitan Oleate, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Oil, Disodium EDTA, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Butylene Glycol, Bixa Orellana Seed Oil, Tocopherol*\n\n* Skinfood Aloe Watery Sun Water Gel 50+ PA+++: Very happy with this sunscreen, although the oil control is hit or miss. Some days when I apply it after moisturizer it has a nice, almost powdery finish and I forget it's even there. Some days I'm more oily but I'm still figuring out what the cause of that might be. I don't wear foundation so I can't speak to how this sits under makeup but I do wear a little blush and I can still see it at the end of the day. When I apply it I pat it around my face and then rub it in, there is a slight white cast at first but for me it disappears very quickly, however, I am fair skinned.\n\n*Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Octyl Methoxycinnamate, Octyl Salicylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Peg/Ppg-10/1 Dimethicone, Lauryl Peg-9 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Stearalkonium Hectorite, Titanium Dioxide, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Propylene Carbonate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Fragrance, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Tocopherol*\n\n* CosRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid: I use three pumps MWF and occasionally a tiny amount to spot treat nodules.

Not exactly sure exactly which countries sell the ‘Made in China’ version, but Google has confirmed it’s sold in Singapore and Malaysia.\n\nThe major difference is that the Japanese version contains Tranexamic Acid, Vit C derivative, and Vit E. The ‘Made in China’ version contains Niacinamide, alpha-Arbutin, Vitamin C, and Reservatol. Interestingly, the Japanese version also mentions nano hyaluronic acid while the ‘Made in China’ version does not.\n\nInterestingly, the SEA version that was ‘Made in China’ **did** feature the same ingredients as the Japanese version with TA. The only difference was where it was made (China vs Japan). This was reformulated sometime in 2022 (around June/July/August, if I remember correctly) to the current arbutin and niacinamide version.\n\n# ‘Made in Japan’ Japanese version:\n\n* **Images:**\n\n1.

    "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nJust wanted to put out a quick review on this mask.  I hardly ever use sheet masks as most of them make me itchy (even the Klairs Supple Prep mask).  Luckily, this one did not and really hydrated my skin, which lasts through the next day.\n\nThese are pretty good!  Maybe even great, depending on your skin's needs.\n\nThey come split into two parts.  The mask material itself is cross-hatched and sturdy.  You can give it a good tug while fitting it on our face and it's no big deal.  Other than that, it feels like regular mask material (cotton).  The fit for me was good.  It was definitely big enough to cover most my (normal-sized) face with a bit to spare.  \n\nVery saturated with the juice.  It's not a creamy formula, just the usual serum style.  And get this...NO FRAGRANCE.  I know many people love the nice smelling stuff, but this one is great option for people who can't tolerate it.  Plus it has tons of ceramides.\n\nIn terms of how long until the masks drys out...well I've never made it that far.  I wore one yesterday for 40min (youtube! stop being so distracting!), pulled it off and it was still soggy.\n\n\n**Ingredients List:** Water, Butylene glycol, glycerin, 1,2-hexanediol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycereth-26, Propanediol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Panthenol, Betaine, Allantoin, Cellulose, Hydroxyethyl cellulose, Sodium hyaluronate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hydrogenated lecithin, Ceramide NP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide AP, Ceramide AS, Ceramide EOP, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Carbomer, Arginine, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Acetate, PVM/MA Copolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Glyceryl Acrylate/ Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n\nOverall, I would rate this mask positively.  It's hydrating and benign...which is what I look for in a mask.\n\n\n**Pros:**\n\nGood material\n\nNo fragrance\n\nHydrating AF\n\n\n**Cons:**\n\nCost (USD 3$/mask)\n\n\nEdit: my goodness I need to learn to spell",

    "body": "I am trying to understand what is the deal with Purito and their sunscreens.\n\nThey have two different sunscreens\n\n* Centella Green Level Safe Sun \n* Centella Green Level Unscented Sun\n\nAlthough they have the same two UV filters (one UVA filter and one UVB filter), the formulation is not the same. However, the company claims the exact same SPF and UVA PF results for both sunscreens: PPD of 22.59 and SPF of 84.5 (you can see the videos below). This is very strange as even if the exact same formulation is tested twice, we will not get the EXACT same results.\n\nApart from the fact that they have used one set of results for both sunscreens, which is fairly suspicious, they have disclosed the percentage of UV filters used in their unscented formulation. According to their website: “The PURITO Centella Green Level Safe Sun contains 3% of Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate and 2% of Ethylhexyl Triazone.”\n\nThis means that they claim an SPF of 84.5 just from 2% of a single UVB filter.\n\nNow in contrast to this sunscreen, we have the Invisible fluid (formerly known as the Shaka Fluid) from La Roche Posay. This sunscreen claims to feature a special technology to “gel and stabilize the droplets containing the filters, thus forming an extremely tight and protective structure”. With this technology on board, the company still uses a good amount of UV filters, namely Octisalate (5%), Uvinul T 150 (4.5%), Tinosorb S (4%), Avobenzone (3.5%), Mexoryl XL (2%), Mexoryl SX (0.495%).\n\nAs in Europe any SPF above 60 can only be labelled SPF 50+, we can only learn more information about this product’s SPF from other countries. In Brazil, it is marketed as SPF 60 when they are able to market products with SPF 70 (https://www.laroche-posay.com.br/anthelios/hydraox-fluid-fps60). So I will assume it has an SPF of 60 - 70.\n\nSo, La Roche Posay must use a special technology and 9.5% UVB filters and 6.495% of broad spectrum filters, i.e. a total of 16% of filters blocking UVB (8 times more filters) to get a lower SPF.\n\nEven the filter used by Purito at 2%, is used by La Roche Posay at 4.5%, i.e. more than double.\n\nNow for the UVA protection, La Roche Posay claim a PPD of 46 as opposed to 22.59, but still there, they use 10% of UVA filters as opposed to 3%. So, they are using more than 3 times the amount of filters to achieve double the PPD value.\n\nIs it possible that the formulation of the Purito is so special that they can use 8 times less filters to get a higher SPF???\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Centella Green Level Safe Sun**\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dibutyl Adipate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, Niacinamide, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Silica, Cetearyl Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Centella Asiatica Extract (4315 ppm), Hyaluronic Acid, Tocopherol, Sorbitan Olivate, Glycery l Stearate SE, Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Sorbitan Stearate, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Disodium EDTA, Adenosine, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nPPD = 22.59 and SPF = 84.5\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZy0t\\_UCgNk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZy0t_UCgNk)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Centella Green Level Unscented Sun**\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Glycerin, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene , Acrylates Copolymer, Silica , 1,2-Hexanediol, Niacinamide, Dibutyl Adipate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Cetearyl Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Sorbitan Olivate, Glyceryl Stearate, Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Sorbitan Stearate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Disodium EDTA, Adenosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopherol\n\nPPD = 22.59 and SPF = 84.5\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOQJzdQaiF4",

They'll buy it, and a lot of them will go out under the sun thinking they're protected. But no they're not, and will increase their chances of sunburns and melanoma.\n\nYes, I do think that promoting Purito sunscreens is harmful to most consumers. Because not everyone knows how unprotective this sunscreen is.\n\nAnd then, people say this is an inside sunscreen. UVA penetration through windows is highly overestimated by people. You don't need sunscreen inside. If you live close to windows everyday, then buy curtains???",

Of course filter concentrations don't say everything, different grades of mineral filters, coatings and inactive ingredients can influence the SPF a lot. So you can't determine the SPF solely based on filter concentrations, but going from on average 15-25% needed for SPF50+ to 3.6-5%, I mean it's at least something that jumps out and makes me curious. It's the first time I see a sunscreen with such a high filter efficiency. I hope Regardsurlescosmetiques or someone else will test the Purito Comfy and Green Level, although it's of course difficult to say how reliable these in vitro results are, maybe it will give some insight.",

Ultra elegant, yet SPF50+, PA++++ (ok, it only means PPD >16, but still)... something doesn’t quite add up, even factoring in the amount of alcohol that goes into the some of them. If high protection EU sunscreens have taught us anything, it’s that (currently) you can’t have high protection without harming (to some extent) the elegance of a sunscreen. And in many cases a good balance has been found (eg Shaka Fluid for a lot of people), but I’m really skeptical of these ‘seemingly perfect’ sunscreens from Asia because the SPF-branding is less regulated and the results just don’t seem to align with what Europe offers.",

It also looks like La Roche Posay sunscreens do not contain the array of antioxidants that the Purito one does, because antioxidant plant extracts may [enhance the SPF value](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4177626/).\n\nAn interesting note, while looking at the La Roche Posay sunscreen from the Brazilian website the Google translation says that it is water and sweat resistant, which is interesting, because in Australia, we have the same product but it does not have any water resistance claims.\n\nTaking all this together, in my opinion there might be differences in how the products are manufactured which would play a very big role in the tested SPF, but also the ingredients other than the UV filters would affect their SPF. \n\nThat would be my take on it.",

So if we take it that it’s SPF is indeed 60, and if the UVA is 46, wouldn’t that mean the Invisible Fluid would have a Boost Star rating above 3 since the SPF and UVAPF are much closer to one another, compared to say the P20? We don’t have a Boots Star rating for the Invisible Fluid (as far as I know), but the Ambre Solaire Fluid, which we are assuming is very close to the Invisible Fluid, only has a Boots Star rating of 3. If it did have the same protection as the Invisible Fluid (SPF60 & PPD46) shouldn’t it have a higher star rating? I don’t like the Boots system, as I think it is confusing and misleading, but it got me thinking. Also I have been using the Garnier Ambre Solaire Advanced Fluid since March and it’s great (briefly went back to Shaka/Invisible Fluid, but prefer the more matte Garnier), so I hope it has a similarly high UVA protection.",

    "body": "So this is my original thread which was a complete & utter mess. But some of you may have followed it till I became so confused: [https://www.reddit.com/r/EyeFloaters/comments/ihfmzc/what\\_im\\_testing\\_to\\_get\\_rid\\_of\\_my\\_1\\_floater/](https://www.reddit.com/r/EyeFloaters/comments/ihfmzc/what_im_testing_to_get_rid_of_my_1_floater/)\n\nAfter 10 months of crazy non-stop testing, looking for patterns, I've come to the conclusion that heavy metal toxicity was the direct cause of my floaters. I must admit, this was not on my radar at all when I began. I didn't even once consider that heavy metals could cause this problem.\n\nBut now that I've seen how quickly / effectively this worked (in my case) I'm suspecting that hundreds if not thousands of you people with floaters - have heavy metal poisoning. Whether it's cadmium, mercury, lead, arsenic, bismuth, nickel, aluminum... there's countless ways to be exposed.\n\nThese heavy metals eventually get stored in your bones. They directly poison all your organs. You completely lose enzyme systems, detoxification abilities - floaters get worse & worse.\n\nNow there aren't many, but there are some haters & naysayers. I had some genius tell me that floaters \"can't be cured\" cause his surgeon (WTF) told him that. Yes of course! Your surgeon wants you spend a fortune on a risky surgery. But floaters are not scars. This is not \"removing scars\" from your eyes. It's a build up of waste. Waste that can't be removed because your detoxification system is clogged up with heavy metals, which broke all your enzymes. That is MY THEORY. I believe very strong in it.\n\nHere are the videos. I uploaded them to a throw away channel for anonymity. As this remains controversial. Parts 1, 2 & 3:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSPiY529uw&ab\\_channel=JasminPeerce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSPiY529uw&ab_channel=JasminPeerce)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1YRwKYJX6Q&ab\\_channel=JasminPeerce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1YRwKYJX6Q&ab_channel=JasminPeerce)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWhFlsu-K9o&ab\\_channel=JasminPeerce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWhFlsu-K9o&ab_channel=JasminPeerce)\n\nThis was the original enzyme video I posted in my old thread. This is not mandatory, does not talk about floaters, but shows real clearly how important enzyme systems are for good health:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_NAb3YUWNU8&ab\\_channel=SiliconValleyHealthInstitute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NAb3YUWNU8&ab_channel=SiliconValleyHealthInstitute)\n\nThis is the best video on all of YT about how EDTA works. DO NOT even consider using EDTA one time until you've seen (and understood) most this video. He does recommend different forms of EDTA like magnesium EDTA. And apparently it's easy to make by mixing regular magnesium chloride with normal EDTA. I have both & should try making that form. But normal disodium EDTA worked wonderfully for me. The main thing you have to be careful about is your initial detox reaction (as you start you spew out heavy metals). You need to GO LOW & SLOW. TAKE YOUR TIME. No other supplement I listed can make you that sick, but EDTA CAN. It made me gravely ill 2-3 days after my first dose. So I came back to it at a lower dose. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIs1gl1-zCc&ab\\_channel=JamesRoberts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIs1gl1-zCc&ab_channel=JamesRoberts)\n\nNow PLEASE. This is what worked for me. I NEED / WANT to see other people try this. I suspect even a low burden of heavy metals can cause floaters. But please don't rush it like I said. Please test what I recommended. See if it works for you. IF IT DOES WORK for many people, I'll do a 4th video a while from now... with some amazon affiliate links. To try to recoup some money from the small fortune I spent on everything. But only if people get success. If people have questions feel free to ask. But try not to ask about EDTA you should get most your advice from that doctor I linked.\n\nTo be clear, I had the 1 giant floater for about 5 yrs now. Which broke up into smaller floaters. I spent the last 10 months actually trying to do something. The last 2 months I considered it completely cured. Though I'm NOT stopping chelation. I may chelate another few yrs to be honest as it keeps making me feel better & better the more I do it. \n\nGOD BLESS REDDIT & HAPPY 4TH!\n\n\\-NS\n\nps. my dog isn't barking cause she has to pee it's the fireworks outside. =\\]",

Your surgeon wants you spend a fortune on a risky surgery.\n\nDo you think eye surgeons have so few patients that they need to force people to get surgery for floaters to make a quick buck? Eye surgery is not a difficult business, they do surgery every week for much more serious problems than floaters. Or do you think that the entire field of eye medicine is conspiring to hide supplements from us because they want to do a surgery that they routinely refuse to do in the first place because they usually consider it too risky? Either way I hope you realize that this statement is wrong.\n\n>But floaters are not scars. This is not \"removing scars\" from your eyes. It's a build up of waste.

KETO diet, 2 years, seemed to help my body but no effect on floaters. I finally quit that because of constipation several years ago.\n\n2. 10X Health system DNA testing and going on two of their recommended vitamin pills a day. This may have produced an effect, but I wasn't particularly looking at floaters to see if it was working. I still take these after a couple of years.\n\n3. Chlorine Dioxide. This may be the answer. I have eliminated a mole or skin cancer on my rt cheek, an infection in my nose membranes that broke through to the outer skin, a case of apparent pneumonia, where my breathing was \"wheezy\". (I am 78) I also sleep like a log now, straight through for 5.5 to 7 hours and awaken with no real desire to stay in bed but get on with the new day. \n\nI have been making and using about 1/2 - 3/4 liter of CDS per day for maybe 6 months.",

Woot!\n\nI have oily skin, so I didn't find the 6.5 whip cleanser drying, but this new cleanser definitely left my face feeling more moist and smooth than the other one. It also doesn't contain any essential oils,  random plant extracts, or fragrance, so it felt very clean and didn't cause irritation. There is a slight milky scent to it but it's probably from the ingredients themselves rather than from something added in.\n\nOverall, I find this to be a pretty solid second-step cleanser - it's non-drying, very affordable, and simple. Those with sensitive and dry skin types may like to consider this!\n\nIngredients list: WATER / AQUA / EAU, SODIUM COCOYL ISETHIONATE, GLYCERIN, COCO -BETAINE, POTASSIUM BENZOATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, CITRIC ACID, TROMETHAMINE, DISODIUM EDTA, PANTHENOL, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, MADECASSOSIDE\n\nEdit: added some pics of the actual product on my hand: [https://imgur.com/a/VJgZPPm/](https://imgur.com/a/VJgZPPm/)",

Parachute discontinued this product soon after and I was heart broken, so were my friends who became equally obsessed. BUT, they brought it back, my boyfriend discovered it for me and I immediately asked a friend of mine to get it from India (I am currently residing in UK). I was very excited to try it, the texture is same as the previous product but they have definitely changed the formulation. The scent is also very different from the discontinued product.\n\nThe new formulation is amazing and this has become my holy grail again. I would repurchase it in a heartbeat, ive struggled with fungal acne and this product is the only thing that helps me. i love it SO MUCH. it really is the best fucking product and i am so happy it is back. I will be loyal to this till the end of my life.

Sorry the image isn't super aesthetic but I wanted to write the post asap!\n\n**About me:** 24F\n\n**Climate:** Between 35-39 degrees this summer, slightly humid but really dry most times.\n\n**Skin type:** My body's skin is dehydrated and always needs to be moisturised; however, even slightly heavy lotions make me sweat.\n\n**Texture of this lotion:** Looks like any regular lotion, bFraut when rubbed in it literally disappears into my skin in a good way. It spreads like a serum/water lotion.\n\n**Fragrance:** Light but pleasant scent, very similar to other Vaseline lotions. \n\n**Cost:** MRP 300\n\n**WRP/WNRP:** WRP\n\nIngredients list: Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Glutathione, Sodium Hyaluronate, Retinyl Palmitate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Glycine, Cystine, Sodium PCA, Petrolatum, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Perfume, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Styrene/​Acrylates Copolymer, Disodium EDTA, Coco-Glucoside, BHT, Benzoic Acid, Citric Acid, Potassium Hydroxide\n\n*Moisturisers I've already tried and mini reviews (note:* ***reviews are only for summers, otherwise I love all of these lotions and they work perfectly during winter***\\*):\\*\n\n* *Vaseline Aloe lotion* \\- Too light and not moisturising enough.\n* *Vaseline Restoring variant in the yellow bottle* \\- Makes me sweat in summer.\n* *Parachute Blue Bottle* \\- heavy and makes me sweat in summer.\n* *Vaseline Aloe Gel tube* \\- I really like this one for summer, gets absorbed super fast and gives a cooling feeling. However, I don't know if it helped with my dehydrated skin.\n* *Vaseline Daily Bright & Calming Body Serum -* I love this one. Though it's slightly less moisturising it's actually good for really hot and humid days.\n* I've also used the *Neutrogena hydro-boost gel* and *Cosrx All-in-one cream*s on my body because my face skin reacted badly to them - I honestly loved these for my body during summers because of how light but hydrating they are but obviously they're too expensive to be purchased to use on the body.\n* Lastly, I've tried to dilute every regular lotion with some water; *Minimalist 5% Niacinamide Lotion*, *Vaseline advanced repair* and one of the *Nivea dark blue bottle*s (all my HGs for winter). All of them still made me sweat after the water dried down.\n\nI have tried the *Vaseline Gluta-hya Serum-in-lotion* for about 1 week now and love it already!\n\nThis one looked like any other lotion but when applied, it literally turns into a watery serum consistency and gets absorbed by my skin within minutes. It doesn't feel heavy at all but moisturises very well for quite a few hours.\n\nI had to reapply on some really dry parts of my body within 4 hours but I'd take that any day over the sweaty feeling I get from using regular lotions in summer.\n\nIts scent is very similar to the Yellow Vaseline lotion however, it's slightly different and it's quite pleasant.\n\nIf anyone of you had used the Vaseline spray-on lotion/serum thing, this Gluta-hya thing is a more moisturising version of that product which is great because I also like the spray lotion despite it being slightly less moisturising.\n\nI don't know if it's really new in the market or if I've just found it but it's a good find!\n\nAlso, at the back of the tube, it says that this specific variant has *'Dual UV Filters'* i.e. UVA and UVB filters but obviously, I doubt if it's good enough protection, so I won't stop using my body sunscreen yet.\n\nThey also have another variant called [Dewy Radiance Serum-in-Lotion](https://www.myntra.com/body-lotion/vaseline/vaseline-non-sticky-gluta-hya-dewy-radiance-serum-in-lotion---200-ml/22580648/buy?gclid=Cj0KCQjwi46iBhDyARIsAE3nVrZg5uLe88lcJQxcHA5kivV2zWTXKHmiQ3ZT1v1Twhhmqj53tFr9twIaAu3lEALw_wcB) if anyone's interested!\n\nApologies if my format/writing isn't that great!",

    "body": "In my opinion the only way ascorbic acid may potentially work topically is when it's used fresh, and applied at night in the absence of UV exposure. Personally I don't believe in preformulated water based ascorbic acid products. Even when it's fresh the amount of studies that prove that vitamin c really works topically is quite limited. Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid. Shelf life is no indication of the stability of actives and doesn't say anything about it's stability on skin. Ascorbic acid is simply notoriously unstable, it's more likely to degrade on skin and be irritating. From all the research available today, the best efficient way to get ascorbic acid in skin is to just take it orally.\n\nBeneficial actives in bold, potential irritants in italic/stripethrough\n\n**Water based products**: below pH3.5 the ionic charge of AA is removed ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5605218/)), improving skin penetration and stability, but water based products remain extremely unstable ([ref](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/7291637/stability-of-vitamin-c-derivatives-in-solution-and-topical-formulations/3),[ref](https://skinelegance.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/CSBM_-Skincare-theories-busted-Dec-2014.pdf)), most companies don't store their product in fridges in warehouses, it isn't unlikely products are severely oxidized by the time they arrive at your home\n\n* [€18/50mL - Skinlex 20%](https://www.skinlex.com/product/20-vitamin-c-serum-30ml/)\n  * **pH:** 3-3.3\n  * **Pros:** simple irritant free formula, right pH, pump is convenient compared to pipet, light serum, inexpensive\n  * **Cons:**  pump is not airless, concentration other actives unknown, instability, the look and feel of website and adress of company make me doubt if it's really formulated by a well educated cosmetic chemist\n  * **INCI:** Water, **20% L-Ascorbic Acid**, Butylene Glycol, **Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin**, *Triethanolamine*, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol.\n\n* [€28/50mL - SkinPep C15](https://skinpep.com/super-c15-serum/)\n * **pH:** 4.3\n  * **Pros:** Great blend of actives, light serum, shared concentrations\n  * **Cons:** pH is too high, dropper, instability, incorrect ingredient order (Propylene Glycol)\n  * **INCI:** Aqua, **15% l- Ascorbic Acid, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3, Panthenol**, Hydrolyzed Collagen, **1% Alpha Tocopherol, 0.5% Ferulic Acid**, Glycerin , *Triethanolamine*, Phenoxyethanol, *2% Propylene Glycol*, Ethoxydiglycol, Laureth-23\n\n* [€34/50mL -Wishtrend 21.5 Advanced Serum](http://www.wishtrend.com/skin-care/1215-pure-vitamin-c215-advanced-serum-by-wishtrend.html)\n * **pH:** unknown\n  * **Pros:** Simple irritant free formula\n  * **Cons:** concentration is a bit high, dropper bottle, lack of stabilizers, not many actives \n  * **INCI:** Hippophae Rhamnoides Water (70%), **Ascorbic Acid** (21.5%), Sodium Lactate, 1,2-Hexanediol, **Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol**, Cassia Obtusifolia Seed Extract, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol\n\n* [€41.60/50mL - SkinActives 15%](http://www.skinactives.com/Vitamin-C-Serum-Ascorbic-Acid-L.html)\n * **pH:** 1.5-2.5\n  * **Pros:** Airless pump!, great blend of actives, not very expensive, no propylene glycol, ph is low enough for penetration, skinactives is busy with a reformulation without the citrus extracts.\n  * **Cons:** ph is irritating, according skinactives not suited for daily use, lack of stabilizers like water reducing agents, recrystalizes quickly.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water.

The reviews on Sephora have been fantastic and it has 20% THD ascorbate (which they call a mega-potent, ultra stable form of vitamin c. They claim that the THD ascorbate is 50x more powerful than traditional vitamin c (I am skeptical and what are they referring to with “traditional vit c”).  Also has 3% vitamin E and 2% ferulic acid. The only negative I read in the reviews is people saying it was not ideal for dry skin types. Do you have any experience with this? \n\nPS- thank you so much for your comprehensive list, it is much appreciated!!

It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

Only experience will tell how it works in your hair\"\n\n\"That particular silicone is designed to attach to damaged areas in your hair - little chipped cuticle edges, broken cuticles. It doesn't prevent moisture from entering the hair strands. It acts like a conditioning ingredient. It will wash out with almost any detergent. The only detergent that does not remove it very well is Decyl glucoside or Lauryl glucoside - and that only applies when one of those is the *only* detergent in a shampoo\"\n\n-Science-y hair blog.\n\nMeaning, in theory you won't be experiencing buildup but also get the silicone effect. This silicone can be washed off with cocoamidopropyl betaine Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Sodium lauroyl glutamate, Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate all of these can wash out the silicone and all of these are cg approved. \n\nSo, in theory and from a logical point of view, this could be a budget friendly conditioner suitable for curly hair! \n\nAlso if you've used this conditioner please share your experience!",

It's been a month now and OP, I can't thank you enough for your post. \n\nI have 2B curls with fine hair and it was damaged (bleaching, color, heat treatment 😭) before I started CGM. I started experimenting with combination of products over the last year and realised my hair needs medium level of conditioning and protein makes it very dry. So I stick to a normal routine of washing my hair with SebaMed Anti-dry shampoo(prescribed by my derm) and WOW Morrocan Argan Oil Conditioner. I use a few drops of Nature's Tattva Sweet Almond oil as my leave in and WOW aloe vera gel. This seemed to work for my hair but I still wasn't happy with my hair. \n\nSaw your post and thought of giving the pantene conditioner, Silky Smooth variant in Advanced haircare series a try. And OMG, IT IS CGM FRIENDLY. Still waited a month to be able to judge the conditioner and it works wonders without breaking the pocket. It doesn't have as much slip as a heavy condioner would have though, maybe the damage protection variant might, so I don't recommend it for extremely dry hair. I mainly use it to detangle and am planning to dilute it to use as a leave-in as well.",

The miracle boost USED to contain n-acetyl glucosamine (which is the one I used) as well the other ones listed here.

But for niacinamide, I saw results for skin texture/overall brightening before that.\n\nI honestly couldn't believe the price Target was selling it for, because I got it for a much higher price elsewhere before. I couldn't keep affording it so I let it go, sadly. :'(\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe [**Luminous Tone Perfecting Treatment ($24.99)**](https://www.olay.com/en-us/skin-care-products/regenerist-luminous-tone-perfecting-treatment) is a simpler formula, but still has the same active ingredients.\n\n*Water,* ***Niacinamide\\*****, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Dimethicone,* ***Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine***\\*, Silica, Boron Nitride,\\* ***Ascorbyl Glucoside***\\*, Polyglyceryl-2 Oleate, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Dimethiconol, Aminomethyl Propanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Oleate, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium EDTA, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, \\*Vitamin B3\\*\n\nBut ironically, it costs more than the more complex booster if you purchase at Target online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DIY:**\n\nI have made DIY niacinamide NAG serums before. But because I'm too lazy to make it properly, they really lack penetration power. I'm really into cosmetic science and have read from professional cosmetic chemists that a simple DIY isn't effective if you don't do it right. You gotta keep the powders dissolved right and STAY dissolved instead of them recrystallizing on your skin and not penetrating your skin/being useless. I experimented for months with the DIY but I DEFINITELY noticed a difference as soon as I started using well-formulated, commercially available niacinamide serums.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy personal experience with certain products:\n\n\\- [**Eva Naturals 5% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-Niacinamide-Serum-Eva-Naturals/dp/B0147PDMYY/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=eva+naturals+niacinamide&amp;qid=1561763684&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3)**:** Pretty awesome, works well, you get 2 oz. But it has avocado oil and such, and may break some people out. (This is definitely a private-label product and you can find the same exact formula for cheaper on DIY sites - which is why you see like 324982394 bottles of the same formula of everything from niacinamide to vitamin c serums on amazon.) I get the same sort of overall brightening and translucency I get with Olay. Better results with my other products, Benton 0.5% salicylic acid (very gentle) aloe BHA toner, Purito green level centella buffet serum (also has niacinamide, like 2%), and Naturie Hatomugi gel essence. Bright, translucent skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Cerave PM:** Supposedly has 4% niacinamide. Loved this as a lightweight moisturizer, but did NOT see the results I got with other niacinamide products. Makes me feel skeptical. Or perhaps there's a pretty big difference for my skin with 4% and 5%. I doubt it, but you know. Maybe it's just cuz it's formulated for skin-replenishing and not for brightening. But you'd think same ingredient will have same effects, y'know?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Skinlex 10% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.skinlex.com/product/10-niacinamide-serum-60ml/)**:** Ingredient list looks GREAT and some others seem to love it, but I saw absolutely zero niacinamide benefits for my skin. Penetration issue?\n\nI have other products I've used with niacinamide, but these are the main ones I can remember on the top of my head. La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+ baume has it as well, but I do not know the %. Very good moisturizer for the body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther commercial products you can find SEPIWHITE in:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Black Opal skin care products**](https://blackopalbeauty.com/collections/skincare): They have multiple.

I'm used to it now though and have a completely unfragranced routine. If you're accustomed to fragranced products I think you'll definitely find this unbearably unpleasant.\n\nI will say the texture itself is quite pleasant. It's got a silky smooth texture that spreads easily. You don't need a lot which is good but I'm definitely using it up more quickly than I was expecting.\n\nI'll probably stick with it for 3 months to see if there's any improvement but at the moment I'm seeing a small improvement in overall skin tone but not much improvement on sun spots that I wanted this product to fade. I do use this after TO Niancinamide so hopefully the peptide brighteners work together!",

Since I have acne-prone skin, the ingredient list scared me a little at first. The texture of the product is definitely very, very light, you don't even feel it on your face. The product is absorbed into the face very quickly, but after a while there is a slight oily feeling when you touch your skin. That's why I don't know if someone with very oily skin can like this product. I think that moisturizing is not enough for dry skin. When I started using Differin, I had to apply this product in several layers because differin dried out my skin, and I was still getting flaky places on my face. There are too many extracts on the ingredient list, some of which can cause fungal acne and clogged pores. \n\nAs a result, I think combination skins would like this product. If you have oily skin, I think you can use it in winter. Its performance under makeup, on the other hand, was not very good. That greasy feeling if you use a shiny bb cream or foundation, it reduces its concealing and creates an oily appearance rather than a glowy appearance. I don't think I will buy the product again. The size is 110ml and I think it's too big to finish in 6-12 months. I don't think it provides an extra benefit to my skin. It was an ordinary moisturizer for me. If you have also used it, please write down your reviews!!",

This essence has the highest concentration of the three offerings with 62.7% fig extract.\n\nI’ll be honest...by the time I had worked this essence into my routine the Fig Cleansing Balm and Fig Scrub Mask had already “failed” for me. Both of them were just a bit too heavy for my taste...either by being too abrasive or leaving behind a waxy residue.\n\nAnd the Fig Boosting Essence falls into that same category unfortunately. Rather than being a super thin/watery essence (like those from Missha or Secret Key) the goal here is more about rich hydration and nourishment and the consistency is ever-so-slightly thicker than water.\n\nWhile it totally delivers on that hit of hydration...I found there to be a slight oily feeling residue after patting in even one layer. It’s not something I really like during my essence stage and I had a similar issue with the Laneige Cream Skin.\n\nI could 100% see those with drier skin types or those that love heavier/more occlusive formulations to really get along with this product.

I really like this set because it makes it easy to carry around for overnight stays or on the plane.\n* **Ingredients**: Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Alcohol Denat., PEG/PPG017/6 Copolymer, Sodium Hyaluronate, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract , Cymbopogon Citratus Extract, Citrus Unshiu Peel Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Tricholoma Matsutake Extract, Cordyceps Sinensis Extract , Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Extract, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Fruit Extract, Saururus Chinensis Leaf/Root Extract, Arnica Montana Flower Extract, Artemisia Absinthium Extract, Broussonetia Kazinoki Bark Extract, Coptis Chinensis Root Extract , PEG-60 Hydrogenated Cator Oil, Carbomer, Tartaric Acid , Glycolic Acid , Lactic Acid , Tromethamine, Disodium EDTA, Benzophenone-5, CI 19140, CI 17200, Fragrance\n* **Product smell, texture & finish**: It smells like lemon, which is really off putting as I've had lemon = bad drilled into my head. It leaves a sticky finish but you have to wash it off. \n* **Product effects compared to claims**: Claims - \"this product provides gentle yet effective exfoliation of dead skin cells and impurities, leaving skin smoother and clear.\" Sure, I guess? It's gentle, but I didn't think it left it particularly smoother than any of my regular acid products.\n* **Where it fits in the routine & how it behaves with other products**: I use it as my acid step after cleansing, but it's a wash off acid, so you have to bear that in mind.\n* **How long it has been used for**: I've used two pads so far.\n* **Has it been/will it be repurchased**: Has not been repurchased, and will not be repurchased.\n* **Concluding remarks**: I like them well enough and I'm glad I got to try it because those tubs have been super inviting, and I've been lemming HARD. But honestly it just hasn't wowed me to make me want to use it often. Especially as I have to wash it off, which is like, WHY. This is effort, I don't see a huge change and compared to the Innisfree Green Barley Peeling Pad, it's pretty meh. What I will say is that you can use it as a body pad just before a shower which is actually not bad because it is mega mega soaked in product.\n \n\nIf there are other points you think should be included in the template or removed, please let us know. \n\n--- \n#Help Threads, Asking for Advice & The Wiki \nFor the foreseeable future we will not have help threads. The daily threads are discussion threads, not help threads, so while advice has been freely given we want to make it very clear that **no member of the community is obligated to give advice or help anyone**. Every discussion topic should feel like a slumber party where you're talking stuff out with your friends. Advice should be part of an organic discussion. \n \nInstead of, “I'm NW15, should I buy The Face Shop Super Ultra Cool to the MAX in 13?”\n \nTry, “It's summer and I've seen a lot of cooling cushions around that make me really curious. Do they work? I have no idea! I read this review that said they do and this one that says they don't. My NW15 skin thinks they're a gimmick, but I'm tempted to get this The Face Shop Super Ultra Cool to the MAX in 13 I found on Peony Peony Store. Anyone tried any cooling products from this line?”\n\nPlease remember, if you can easily do an internet search for the answer, you should do so, not expect anyone else to do it for you.\n\nAs r/AsianBeautyAdvice have awesome plans for a wiki, we will not be curating one in the traditional sense.  \n \n--- \n#Other Points:\n\n**Flairs**\n\nThere is also no need for post flairs as everything should be a discussion! \n\nOther than no self promotion (ie no link to your blog/external platform) we have no restrictions on personal flairs. Skin type, location and skin tone are common flair content, but you can also have fun with it as long as it isn’t offensive.\n \nAn example of suitable flairs would be:\n \n* Snail enthusiast\n* Dry/Sensitive Skin | Australia\n* NW20 | Passionate about AB makeup!\n* Tony Moly Banana Pack needs more love\n \n\n**Blogger, Businesses & External Content Creators:**\n\nNo shameless self promotion and no stand alone threads centered around your content. All content creators must follow a 10:1 rule, where for every post of self promotion (ie, relevant link to external content in a discussion post) there must be 10 posts that have nothing to do with themselves or their brand.\n \nIf you are a blogger or external content creator you are expected to participate as any other member of the community, there will be no special flair given.\n \n**Business Rules:** \n\nBusiness representatives who are hoping to post on behalf of their business (ie, clarify ingredient list, or use of product) must first identify themselves to the moderators and they will be given a special flair. Failure to do so will result in all unverified ‘official’ posts being removed.\n \nBasically, you have to prove you’re posting on behalf of Jolse before we let you post on behalf of Jolse.\n \n \n \n#Next Steps:\n\nWe are looking for new mods! Horray!\n \nUS Timezone preferably as I am in the EU and /u/smallrobots is in AUS.\n \nWe are looking for 3 mods:\n\n* 1 CSS Dedicated mod, has no other responsibilities. \n* 3 to help with the day to day moderation. \n\nThis involves clearing out the spam queue, moderating to the rules and responding to modmail.\n \nIf you are interested please send us a modmail with the title, “ABD Mod Application” with a little bit of information about yourself and why you think you would be a great mod!\n\n---\n\n#Thank you!\n\nThat's it for now, thank you guys for all your feedback, we are always listening and we are always working to make ABD the best space we possibly can. New rules take effect immediately, and the sidebar will be updated to reflect that from tomorrow.\n\nAs always, the comments are open for your comments! We'd love to hear from you to explain, clarify or just discuss your thoughts!",

Some of these are repeats and some were first time bought. Let me start with the repeats:\n\n**1) Minimalist Vitamin C + E + Ferulic Acid 16%**\n\n**💸Price:** Rs. 599/- for 20 ml. I got Minimalist Invisible Sunscreen SPF 40 free with it.\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Butylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Citrate, Citric Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Gluconate, Ferulic Acid, Coceth-7, Phenoxyethanol, PPG-1-PEG-9 Lauryl Glycol Ether, Fullerenes, Tocopherol Acetate, Ethylhexylglycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PVP, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n**🍶Packaging:** Dropper black bottle, comes with an extra carton\n\n**Fragrance:** None \n\nIf there's one product I've always raved about, it's this Vitamin C Serum. This has become my HG that I've purchased Multiple times now, and will probably repurchase in future. \n\nI love how it lasts longer and doesn't oxidise quickly compared to other Vitamin C Serums, and there's a no difference in my skin on its usage. It does a good job at lightening and fading acne spots and marks. The only other Vitamin C Serum I like is Cosrx 23%, but it's quite heavy on the pockets. \n\nI'm quite tempted to try out the Klairs and the Numbuzin one. Would appreciate the reviews if anyone has used them.\n\n**2) Formularx Hydrashied Vitamin C + Peptide Watery Gel Sunscreen SPF 50 PA ++++**\n\n**💸Price:** Rs. 699/- for 50 ml. It's frequently available on BOGO offers on their website.\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Vitamin C, Peptides, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin B5\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Octocrylene, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Titanium Dioxide, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ascorbic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate/VP Copolymer, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Gold, Disodium EDTA, Pentapeptide-4, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glutathione, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract\n\n**🍶Packaging:** Tube\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\nThis is my second tube, and I love the texture. It's very lightweight, absorbs easily, no greasiness on the skin and yes, No whitecast. It also doesn't burn my eyes, like the Minimalist Invisible Sunscreen. I doubt it's waterproof, as the tube does state to reapply after exposure to water. Using this post snail mucin essence or a hyaluronic moisturizer gives a dewy look. \n\nAs far as protecting against sun exposure goes, I do cover my face with a dupatta when I leave home. I'd say there's a light tan on my face coz the summer heat is at its peak. Though labmuffin says that good sunscreen don't always prevent tan so I don't know what to say about that. \n\nAs far as the texture goes, it's Amazing, just don't expect miracles when it comes to sun protection.\n\n**3) Pyungkal Yul Calming Moisture  Barrier Cream**\n\n**💸 PRICE:** Rs. 1250/- for 50 ml. Frequently available on discounts at Maccaron\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Centella Asiatica, Ceramides\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Isohexadecane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Stearic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Glucoside, Pentylene Glycol, Trehalose, Ceramide NP, Arachidic Acid, Glucose, Palmitic Acid, Oleic Acid, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Squalane, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Hydroxyacetophenone, Butylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, Disodium EDTA, 1,2-Hexanediol, Tromethamine, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Packaging:** Tub\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\nThis is a BOMB moisturizer. Having a combination skin with oily Tzone always meant trouble finding a good barrier repair cream. Most barrier repair moisturizer having ceramides have thicker textures that feel either too heavy or too greasy, or both, on the skin.\n\nNow I had just started Olay Retinol Serum, and was in need to a ceramide moisturizer to protect my skin barrier. I just randomly bought this on Maccaron when it was available on a great discount.\n\nAnd I've found my HG. It's so good, so lightweight, not at all heavy and soothing. I always end up with a pimple while trying ceramide cream but this one was so light it didn't feel greasy at all. \n\nI'm in love and this has definitely entered my list of future repurchase. \n\n**4) Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Essence Water**\n\n**💸Price:**  Rs. 1500/- for 150ml Available on discounts at multiple websites\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Ginseng, Niacinamide, Adenosine\n\n**Ingredients:** Panax Ginseng Root Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Propanediol, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Water, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glyceryl Glucoside, Panthenol, Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Adenosine, Dextrin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Disodium Edta, Glucose, Panax Ginseng Callus Culture Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Panax Ginseng Berry Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Lactobacillus/Panax Ginseng Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n**Claims:** Cruelty free, no artificial fragrance, colorants, mineral oil, parabens, sulfates.\n\nA cult favourite toner, how could I skip this? And here's my judgement, it's good to damp your skin and give a nice plump. Not ideal if you're looking for the glass skin effect. I think this is one of those products that don't give an immediate result, but when you use it consistently, you do feel your skin looks better. \n\nHaving said that, I don't think this would be a repurchase. It's good, but nothing that stood out. I'd rather experiment with multiple other toners available in the market. ",

I guess because it’s pure ascorbic acid it really does a good job on giving a subtle brightening glow and lightening some spots.\n\nAlso it is not very mild so when i started using it alone it gave me dry flaky skin. So I started mixing it with my moisturiser and things were good !\n\nBefore this I have only used Sugandha vit C which I also liked and Minimalist 10% vit C which did nothing for my skin.",

    "body": "A quick review right before I shower HAHAHA.\n\nInfo:\nI have combination skin leaning towards oily. My skin is acne and clog prone and I do have some KP on my bottom cheeks/jaws. My skin is also a sensitive and moody chicken if anyone’s wondering so I’m super picky about the products I use. \n\n\nRoutine:\n\nAM: Splash with water -> Vanicream daily facial moisturiser -> some sunscreen sample lol\nPM: Dokdo cleanser -> vanicream daily facial moisturiser\n\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Coco-Betaine, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Potassium Benzoate, Sodium Chloride, Polyquaternium-67, Potassium Cocoate, Citric Acid, Fructooligosaccharides, Saccharide Hydrolysate, Disodium EDTA, Pullulan, 1,2-Hexanediol, Allantoin, Panthenol, Sea Water, Sodium Acetate, Butylene Glycol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Caprylic/​Capric Triglycerides, Beta-Glucan, Phosphatidylcholine, Hyaluronic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide NP, Glycine, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Glutamic Acid, Serine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lysine, Alanine, Arginine, Threonine, Proline\n\n\nThis cleanser had a very creamy and sticky texture. It foams a little when you rub your hands together with water. As the whole line is targeted towards sensitive skin, it is a very gentle cleanser.\n\n\nThoughts:\n\nOkay I actually didn’t really expect much from this product when I first used it. It was a huge impulse buy and I actually regretted buying it. Prior to using this cleanser, I was using the Rovectin Conditioning Cleanser and let’s just say that it was one big roller coaster haha. I switched over to this cleanser in hopes to save my skin and also because it was just collecting dust on my desk lol.\n\nThe texture is sooooo fun to play with. Even though it’s creamy, it’s also rather sticky. It’s nothing like the other cleansers I’ve tried before. It doesn’t foam up too much so my skin doesn’t feel stripped.\n\nWhile it doesn’t have any added fragrances, it does have a smell. Personally to me it smells like someone threw up in it, but some people say it smells herbal like or plastic like or mineral like. Yeah lots of different smells LOL. I thought I had bought a fake so I went and bought another cleanser (travel version) from the official store and it smells the same so rip ;-;. \n\nIt’s a no nonsense kind of cleanser, does what it needs to do and does it well. It doesn’t remove makeup that well because it’s quite gentle, so you might need a first cleanser for that. For sunscreen it depends, but I’ve heard some people just cleanse their face twice with the cleanser just to be safe. \n\nCompared to the previous cleanser I used, this one was so nice to use. It made me feel so excited to shower LOL. I didn’t get any reactions from this and in fact, some of my CCs and pimples actually went down when I started using this. \n\nIs this HG? I guess it is. I’m genuinely hesitant to call something a HG because I’m scared that my skin will go no u on me. But I guess at this moment? It is close to being one. I bought mine off of SHOPEE and it cost about SGD$18-$20+ with discount. I think the original price is about $30? I might actually repurchase this once I’m done HAHAHA.  9/10\n\nRoundlab is also well known for their Dokdo toner and I’m really tempted to try it LOL. But I have my pyunkangyul essence toner coming in soon for me to try so ummmm one day one day. My friend actually bought it and said that it’s such a good toner.",

    "body": "Ive been searching for a replacement for a good cleanser for my dry-dehydrated-sensitive skin. I thought I found my HG cleanser this year with the B Lab Matcha Cleanser which left my skin clean but soft. I fell in love just from trying a free sample from Stylevana. Unfortunately B Lab changed the formula and packaging for this cleanser. I bought the new version and hated it. It was dry and stripping like the Senka whip cleanser. \n\nSo I went through some suggestions from this sub and made a list. I was browsing a local shop today and saw the Round Lab Dokko cleanser for $11 for 150 ml and bought it. Beauty of Josean Green Plum cleanser was also on my to try list but it was $12 for 100 ml so I went with the Round Lab just cuz of the better price per ml.\n\nOverall rating: 4/5\n\nScent: mild soapy scent. Nothing offensive. Barely noticeable. \n\nI latered a dollop in my hands with water then washed my face and rinsed with water. It doesnt really foam up. It cleaned off my skincare, Etude eyebrow pencil, Lilybyred blush, Romand water tint, and Stila eyeliner well.\n\nMy skin didnt fee taut/tight. The cleanser didnt leave a weird filmy layer either. It was just my skin but clean. Its light but I wouldn’t call it hydrating — probably because of my dry skin. Best of all, no irritation. \n\n It didnt feel as soft as the og B Lab matcha cleanser though. I might explore other options after I use up this Round Lab one, but this is going to be my fallback cleanser from now on as long as the formula didnt change. \n\nIngredients: Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Coco-Betaine, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Potassium Benzoate, Sodium Chloride, Polyquaternium-67, Potassium Cocoate, Citric Acid, Fructooligosaccharides, Saccharide Hydrolysate, Disodium EDTA, Pullulan, 1,2-Hexanediol, Allantoin, Panthenol, Sea Water, Sodium Acetate, Butylene Glycol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Caprylic/​Capric Triglycerides, Beta-Glucan, Phosphatidylcholine, Hyaluronic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide NP, Glycine, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Glutamic Acid, Serine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lysine, Alanine, Arginine, Threonine, Proline",

But I’m gonna do it anyway…I think out of all the sunscreens I have tried/reviewed (this will be number 16) I haven’t had one recommended and pushed in my direction more than the Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sun. And on paper…I 100% understand why.\n\nThis is the first K-Beauty sunscreen that I have used that doesn’t contain fragrance, essential oils, and has absolutely no white cast…all in one product. The first time I applied this sunscreen I thought “No way…absolute magic.”. The look and feel of this product really reminds me of the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence. But, I find the Purito to be lighter and a bit more creamy/milky (if that makes sense LOL). The Klairs Airy UV Essence is a bit more jelly-like and thicker…although honestly the difference is very minimal.\n\nAnother quality I love about this Purito Unscented Sun is the fairly concentrated blend of Centella Asiatica. 5 different forms of “Cica” are here including Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, and Asiatic Acid. I found this blend (along with the Niacinamide also found here) to help in reducing redness/irritation from a few blemishes and the introduction of Curology/Tretinoin into my routine. \n\nAnd finally, while the scent is very similar to that of the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence…its a bit more mild/approachable. If you remember, I compared it to super glue or artificial nail glue (but not as intense). My first week using the Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sun had me feeling very impressed. It seemed to be doing all the things that I loved about the Klairs Sunscreen but with a lighter feel and at a more affordable (per OZ) cost. I was totally ready to do my happy dance…until I decided to go for a walk/jog without my sun hat LOL!\n\nI posted about it in a few places (so you might already know the story LOL)…but after 57 minutes outside with my forehead exposed (just the Purito Sunscreen on) and I had a fairly noticeable tan line where my head wrap stopped just along my hair line. Honestly, to say I was shocked and a bit disappointed by this was an understatement. I’ve been working so hard to keep my skin away from UV exposure to give the Tretinoin/Hydroquinone as good of a chance to reduce my hyperpigmentation as possible. It really felt like a step back to see this kind of result. \n\nOver the course of the next week (up until today)…my skin just seems to have darkened a bit. Between the combination of being near windows, getting the mail/walking the dog, and having my mask off as I drive to and from places…the Purito Centella Green Level Sunscreen just doesn’t seem to offer as much protection as other products have. I don’t think there has been another sunscreen I have used that I can say this about. Other products may have been greasy, smelly, or white-cast inducing…but they all did the basic function of screening the sun LOL!\n\nNow, this isn’t to say that this product doesn’t have the ability to work. Korea has some strict standards and testing in place so this product is by law…SPF 50+ PA++++ if it’s allowed to be sold as such. However, there are so many other factors that can play into the efficacy of sunscreen once it’s on.\n\nMy sweaty face while exercising, putting on and taking off my face covering, and just daily life will absolutely take a toll on the efficacy of my sunscreen...I get that. But this product from Purito seemed to degrade and become less effective faster (on my skin) than other products I have used including the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence and other “non-waterproof” products. The Klairs in particular came with me on early spring hikes a few times where I was sweating my fat butt OFF (LOL!)…without issue.\n\nOne last thing that kind of tipped me off to the Purito Centella Green Level’s tendency to not get along with my skin was the amount of stinging it caused to my eyes. I have had this happen with other chemical sunscreens…but I felt like it was particularly constant and hard to keep at bay this time around. Usually, by keeping a product a fair distance from my eye line or patting on some physical sunscreen to create a “wall” around my eyes will do the trick. But, this product seemed to find its way to my eyeballs every time LOL!\n\nSo, moral of the story. Is this a “bad” sunscreen…probably not. It’s been tested to provide SPF 50+ PA++++ and I’m sure that it does a fine job for most people. But, depending on your habits/lifestyle…it might not be the best fit (just like anything else). I’m not here to scare anyone into thinking that this product will 100% cause them to burn or tan or spontaneously combust (LOL)…I’m just saying that I’d rather pass on this product in favor of a sunscreen that more accurately fits MY needs. Your experience with this (and any other product) will vary. Right now, that would be the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence.\n\nI love, love, love that people are so passionate about their SPF. While it sometimes makes it hard to feel comfortable talking honestly about SPF, sun protection, skin damage, and even disease caused by sun exposure…I feel like keeping an open/honest discussion about it is important. Especially for those that might be learning about the importance of sun protection for the first time. \n\nRegardless of how intense my “tan line” was…the fact that it was there is a problem for me. Any amount of tanning, skin tone change, or burning is your skin’s response to damage…bottom line. Skin doesn’t do it for fun or know that you prefer that color in the summer time LOL! And you know…some of us will take that knowledge and continue to get our summer tan on. While I don’t love that…I understand it (I mean was the exact same way not too long ago). I just hope that people at least acknowledge the risks and really think about the long-term consequences before heading outside without sun protection. The worst option is to see posts like this or hear warnings and ignore them/pretend you’re the exception. You’re not…no matter your background of skin tone.\n\nAlright, thats it.

    "body": "[Here](https://imgur.com/a/Mnijy) are some pictures of the goods! \n\nWhen you get a haul, even a mini one, there is always at least one thing that doesn't work out the way you thought it would. For my finicky skin, it's usually several things. So I was ***shocked*** when not only did everything from my recent AB haul work for me, but it all worked ***really*** well. So well that I wanted to share my excitement with all of you! I'm still mildly in disbelief right now, this never happens. \n\nCVS was having a BOGO 50% off sale so I decided to try a couple things that I’ve had my eye on. I thought these reviews might be helpful for those in this sub that aren’t very familiar with AB products. My routine is a mix of different types of brands (I do love my French pharmacy products) but I’ve had a lot more luck finding things that work for my skin type in the AB world. Some people get scared off at the idea of ordering things from overseas - either because of shipping cost or the length of shipping times. Since these are all products carried at CVS, they are a lot more accessible for those in the US. \n\n**Skin type:** Oily, dehydration-prone, sometimes sensitive (depends on its mood that day), with a very low tolerance for silicones. \n\n**Holika Holika Aloe Cleansing Foam -** I've had rough luck with foaming cleansers as they all seem to strip my skin (other than my HG LRP Toleraine but it's fun to switch it up sometimes). Not this guy! My skin loves anything aloe and this did not disappoint (aloe is the best humectant for oily skin imo). It has a very dense, thick foam that feels very nice on my skin. The scent is very fresh, it almost reminds me of fresh-cut watermelon and aloe mixed together. It leaves my skin very soft and not remotely stripped. No squeaky-clean feeling here! I'm not positive of the pH but it does contain potassium hydroxide (a pH adjuster) so I'm assuming it's in the normal range and not on the higher end. I think this is going to make a great AM cleanser since it's so gentle. \n\nIngredients: \nAloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Water, Lauryl Hydroxysultaine, Myristic Acid, Lauric Acid, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Chlorphenesin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Palmitic Acid, Capric Acid, Butylene Glycol, Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Potassium Sorbate.\n\n(*Ah-ha! I just saw the watermelon extract as I was adding this, so that explains the lovely scent.)\n\n**Peach Slices Citrus-Honey Aqua Glow Hydrating Moisture Gel -** Holy shit you guys, this is ***everything*** I've been looking for in a winter moisturizer. It's lightweight, a gel, has ceramides, is hydrating *and* moisturizing and doesn't make me oily. The search is over! Seriously, I've been trying to find the perfect moisturizer for about 8 months now. I thought I had the perfect one (Etude House Moistfull Collagen Water Jelly Cream) but turns out it was perfect *for summer*. Once winters cold, dry air came it just wasn't enough. I've desperately wanted to add ceramides to my routine with no luck (Rosette Ceramide Gel was a greasy disaster). The inclusion of ceramides is what originally caught my eye and also the lack of any -cones. My skin is sensitive to silicones and finding a heavier winter moisturizer without any has been virtually impossible. This does include a couple -anes so I was skeptical at first but they don’t seem to bother me as much as straight up dimethicone. Dimethicone + my skin = a greasy mess and lots of clogged pores (and fun little whiteheads all over). The first time I used it, I squeezed out too much but thought 'what the heck, I'll see what happens'. As I began to spread it around, I realized that it was *way* too much product and figured I was doomed for an oily face that night. Cut to a few minutes later, when I was shocked to find that it had ***all*** absorbed. It dries down quickly to a soft, almost-matte finish. It legit gives my skin a healthy glow without making it oily, something that I didn't think was possible. The first time I wore it to work, I was ***incredibly*** impressed by the fact that my skin was still matte at the end of the day. My work's super dry air usually drives my dehydrated skin nuts and by the end of the day, it's over-produced a ton of oil to compensate. But not with this!! It gives my skin the hydration it always needs with just enough moisture to seal it all in. I am absolutely over-the-moon in love with this product and I can't recommend it enough! \n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Polysorbate 60, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Honey Extract, Ceramide Np, Sorbitan Stearate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Isohexadecane, Tromethamine, Hydroxyacetophenone, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Polysorbate 80, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitan Oleate, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Oil, Disodium EDTA, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Butylene Glycol, Bixa Orellana Seed Oil, Tocopherol.\n\n**The Saem Iceland Hydrating Soothing Gel -** The name pretty much says it all and it lives up to those claims. It's very hydrating, soothing and feels very refreshing. The fascinating thing about this product is how it dries down. It leaves an almost undetectable finish. I've never had anything disappear into my skin before - and I say that in the best way possible. It doesn't leave a tacky film the way most gels do. I use the Skinfood aloe gel daily (which does leave a bit of stickiness) and out of curiosity, I applied this on top of it. The combo dried down to almost nothing! It took away the stickiness all together. I am highly impressed with this gel! It is definitely a staple in my routine now and (*gasp*) may just replace my beloved Skinfood aloe (at least in the AM).\n\nIngredients: Water, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate 20, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Perfume, Sodium Acrylates Crosspolymer-2, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Disodium EDTA, Silica, Betaine, Heptane, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Propylene Glycol, Butylene glycol, Cetraria Islandica Extract, Sorbitol, Citric acid, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Prunus Mume Fruit Extract, Lactic acid.\n\n**Elisha Coy Refreshing Ampoule Solution Sheet Mask -** Another product that lives up to its name. I was nervous because these are on the cheaper side and usually the quality reflects that. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised! The mask itself fit very well. It's on the thinner side and it reminds me a lot of my fav sheet masks, the Etude House 0.2mm Air Therapy. It stayed in place and despite the essence being very watery, it didn't drip everywhere. The mask really seemed to hold onto the essence. After I took it off, I patted in the remaining essence from the pouch and it all absorbed completely. I was able to continue my routine with no issues. My skin was left hydrated, soothed and happy. \n\nIngredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Magnolia Kobus Bark Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Betula Alba Juice, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Chrysanthellum Indicum Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Fragrance.\n\nI haven’t had the chance yet to try the rest of the sheet masks yet but I am very excited to do so!! If anyone has any questions, I’m happy to help! :)\n",

The technology behind BHA 9 is indeed unique, allowing for a controlled, sustained release of salicylic acid without diminishing any of its effectiveness. In fact, you will have enhanced results without dryness or irritation! BHA 9 for Stubborn Imperfections has a pH range of 3.2-3.5.\n\nBHA 9 can do all of the following:\n\n* Unclog pores with the first use\n* Diminish white bumps\n* Minimize enlarged pores\n* Refine and smooth skin's texture\n* Minimize sebaceous hyperplasia\n* Smooth and soften dry, rough patches\n* Help balance oily skin\n* Fade red marks from breakouts\n* Reduce breakouts\n\n**Who is this product for?**\n\nRESIST BHA 9 is designed for anyone who has struggled with stubborn skin imperfections who wants enhanced results over and above the treatments they've been using.\n\n**Ingredients**:\n\nPropylene Glycol (solvent/penetration enhancer), PEG-75, PEG-8 (thickeners), Water, Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/time-released exfoliant, 9%), Glycerin (skin-repairing ingredient), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (anti-irritant), Butylene Glycol (slip agent), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant plant extract), Sea Whip Extract (soothing plant extract), Arginine (amino acid/skin-conditioning agent), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent).\n\n**My skin type, in detail:**\n\nSensitive, very irritation-prone, dry-combination (dry cheeks, oily t-zone), very small pores, easily congested skin, stubborn acne spots. Responds well to BP spot treatments. Responds well to BHA and anti-inflammatories. Responds well to lactic acid (AHA). Responds okay to glycolic acid (AHA), can be irritating. Responds very poorly to tretinoin (retin-a, renova, adapalene). Many ingredients break me out (cetearyl, cetyl alcohol; natural oils; some fillers/thickeners). \n\n**My current routine as of Dec. 3, 2013**:\n\n* AM - Cleanse with [PC Hydralight Cleanser](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/collections/Hydralight/_/Hydralight-One-Step-Cleanser/)\n* AM - Tone with [PC Hydralight Toner](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/collections/Hydralight/_/Hydralight-Healthy-Skin-Refreshing-Toner/)\n* AM - Pat on 3-5 drops [PC C15 Super Booster](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/antioxidants/_/RESIST-C15-Super-Booster/). Allow to absorb 5-10 minutes.\n* AM - Pat on pea-sized amount of [Elta MD PM Therapy](http://eltamd.com/product/pm-therapy-facial-moisturizer/) if feeling dry.\n* AM - Apply [Skinceuticals Physical Fusion](http://www.skinceuticals.com/_us/_en/category/physical-fusion-uv-defense-spf-50.htm) is going out for extended periods of time (15m or more).\n* PM - Remove makeup or sunscreen with [Albolene](http://www.albolenecleanser.com/) or [Clinique TTDOB](http://www.clinique.com/product/1673/6424/Skincare/Cleansers_Makeup_Removers/Take-The-Day-Off-Cleansing-Balm/index.tmpl). If no makeup or SS, skip step.\n* PM - Proceed with normal AM cleanse/tone routine.\n* PM - Apply 2 drops of C15 to nose, cheekbones, under eyes.\n* PM - Mix 3 drops C15 with 1 squirt of BHA 9. Apply all over trouble areas (forehead, below cheekbones, jaw). Let absorb 10-15 minutes if possible.\n* PM - Pat on pea-sized amount of Elta MD PM.\n* PM - Pat on tiniest amount of Vaseline on driest spots, if needed.\n\n**Other skincare habits and details**:\n\n* I have taken Ortho Tri Cyclen for about 5 years now.\n* My diet isn't anything to write home to mom about. I enjoy fatty foods and red meats. I drink very little soda and consume virtually no sweets. \n* I sleep on a silk pillowcase.\n* I do not wash my pillowcase every night. I'm lucky if I remember to wash it once a week. Gross, I know.\n* I rarely talk on the phone, and when I do, you can bet my phone hasn't been wiped down with alcohol in the past week. Sorry, y'all.  \n\n**Review**:\n\nI began using this product roughly 1.5 weeks ago after purchasing the $5 sample on Paula's Choice's website. It came in a small vial, similar to a perfume sample you'd get at Sephora or in a beauty subscription like Birchbox. It lasted for roughly 5 days. I began using it every night, mixed with my C15 serum, over my troubled areas (cheeks, jaw, forehead). \n\n*Please keep in mind that I have used 2% BHA Liquid for nearly 2-3 months now, and intermittently for over 2 years prior. I do not know how someone who has never used BHA would respond to this product, as it is 9% salicylic acid (BHA).*\n\nI saw very minimal improvement after 1 day, and mild improvement after 3 days. It was enough for me to order the full-sized product ($40). After 5 days, I saw significant improvement of my mildest (yet troublesome) areas, such as under my cheekbones, where I had clusters of very small open comedones (clogs without skin over the top -- if squeezed, small \"pills\" of sebum pop out). \n\nI'm on roughly day 10 of this product, and I feel confident enough to write this review for those of you who are interested in a stronger BHA but are leery of chemical peels, particularly BHA peels which can be harsh. \n\nIncorporated into my normal routine, my previously rough cheeks feel very smooth. However, my jawline, where I had some massive clogs after my last period (yay hormones), is a bit broken out. Thankfully, the BHA heals these spots pretty quickly as long as I keep an acne patch on them and don't squeeze. My forehead, once full of many clogged pores, is completely clear save for PIH (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation). \n\nI'd incorporate pictures normally but sadly, I didn't take any, so you're just going to have to take my word for it this time. Sorry about that!\n\nAs for the claims, I do feel it is particularly fantastic for clogged pores/blackheads. As for unclogging them at the first use, I'd be leery of that claim depending on the severity of your clogs. For instance, some of the particularly large clogs/blackheads on my cheek are taking awhile to resolve, but are much smaller. This in and of itself helps reduce breakouts, since all breakouts begin as [microcomedones and open comedones](http://www.globalskinatlas.com/upload/745_1.jpg). \n\nI also do feel that it has \"refined and smoothed\" my skin texture, but the C15 has also been very, very good for my skin in that department, imparting me with the baby-soft/smooth skin I once had. \n\nI can't speak for the oily skin, milia, or [sebaceous hyperplasia](http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/medicine/dermatology/melton/266749a.jpg) claims, as these are not issues that my skin has troubles with. However, I would be very interested in hearing others experiences if you have used BHA 9 or even BHA 2% and experienced these skin troubles. \n\n**Bottom line**: \n\nDo I recommend this product? Absolutely, especially if you are particularly prone to stubborn clogs and blackheads that do not resolve with normal 2% BHA usage. As always though, I recommend starting with a low percentage BHA product and working upwards, especially if you are sensitive. \n\n---\n\n\nEdit: Paula's Choice now has a Refer-a-Friend program -- someone refers you, you save $10 on your first purchase. If you're interested in purchasing anything from PC, just contact someone in this sub or myself and we can send you a referral link. This stacks with free shipping offers and offer codes.",

Based on your issues and experience, do you think this might be a good, cheaper alternative for my issues?

    "body": "I’ve been using these toners for the past month or so. I’ve been looking for a milky toner that works for my skin for a while now and Purito’s one was immediately of interest to me, but given how much I enjoy Isntree’s Yam Root Vegan Milk Cleanser, I thought I should try the toner from the same line as well. Other than meadowfoam seed oil and glycerin, they don’t have any ingredients in common, but they’re both hybrid oil-water toners and they’re both aimed at dry and/or sensitive skin. So, I thought it would be worthwhile comparing the two.\n\nMy skin type: Combination, sensitive skin which leans oilier (esp t-zone) in summer and dryer (esp cheeks) in winter. I’m also in the 40+ age range, so I guess I have mature skin (or heading towards mature). It’s currently Autumn/Fall here and it’s usually this time of year that my skin becomes extra sensitive so it was the right time to introduce this type of product into my routine.\n\nInitially, I used both toners and put Purito on one side of my face and Isntree on the other. By doing this, I noticed that Isntree is slightly oilier than Purito and while my skin was like a sponge when it came to absorbing the Purito toner, it took longer for the Isntree one to be absorbed. The finish is also quite different. On the Purito side, it felt very silky (I guess it’s well-named) while the Isntree side remained a little oily. I also noticed the Isntree side developing a bit of congestion, but I wasn’t prepared to write it off for that because that’s the side that I usually sleep on.\n\nNext, I used Purito on its own for two weeks. Totally satisfying! It’s soothing, lightweight and overall enjoyable to use. It smells pretty much exactly like oats which I don’t hate. I can definitely see this becoming a regular part of my routine.\n\nFinally, I’ve just completed a week of using Isntree on its own and yep congestion increased on both sides of my face and I didn’t like the finish much. In terms of smell, I didn’t really notice one, so that might work quite well for some folks. This might still be worthwhile for me to try again in the winter, but it’s definitely not working for me now.\n\n**Isntree Yam Root Vegan Milk Toner Ingredients:**\n\nYam Root Extract (80%), Butylene Glycol 1,2-hexanediol, Purified Water, Trehalose, Panthenol, Sunflower Seed Oil, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Sodium Surfactin, Ceramide NP, Cholesterol, Stearic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hibiscus Esculentus Fruit Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Root Extract, Undaria Pinnatifida Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Seed Extract, Avena Sativa (Oat) Meal Extract, Malt Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Disodium EDTA, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Sodium Polyacrylate, Citric Acid, Deoxyphytantriyl Palmitamide MEA, Glycine Max (Soybean) Seed Extract, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract\n\n**Purito Oat-In Silky Toner Ingredients:**\n\nAvena Sativa (Oat) Seed Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Water, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Beta-Glucan\n\nIf I left anything out, or you want anything more specific on either product, please let me know.",

    "body": "If you're seeking an incredibly gentle chemical sunscreen then this could be the one for you! Biore UV Kids Milk SPF 50 PA++++ is alcohol-free, fragrance-free, water-proof, sweat-proof, coloring-free, zero white cast, and free of all common irritants/unnecessary ingredients. It's one of the only sunscreens that doesn't annoy my very sensitive, acne-prone, easily reddened, and (currently) badly dehydrated face. It's never caused me to break out. Despite being water-resistant it washes off easily at the end of the day with a mild cleanser (I use Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser) which I really appreciate due to the fact that any kind of scrubbing of my face stings and burns while it's in this dehydrated state. This sunscreen does contain petrolatum, so if that's a sensitivity of yours or an ingredient that you prefer to avoid, you may want to avoid this sunscreen. Personally, I don't find that it makes the sunscreen feel greasy or heavy and it's never cause me to break out. It leaves a delicate dewy coating on my face that I really like (for reference, it has a slightly thicker consistency than Neutrogena's Hydroboost Gel Cream). The addition of petrolatum is invaluable for my dehydrated skin as I feel that it forms a slight occlusive barrier over my morning moisturizer (Cerave Moisturizing Cream or Hada Labo Skin Plumping Gel) to prevent TEWL along with protecting my skin from the sun.  \nIt's available on Amazon in a cheerful-looking 90g yellow bottle. It does take a while to arrive because of how far it has to ship, but it's well worth the wait. I personally adore this sunscreen and will never be without it. I never thought I'd be able to say that I look forward to applying sunscreen every day!  \n\n\nUV filters used:  Octinoxate, Tinosorb S, Uvinul A Plus, and Uvinul T 150    \n\n\nIngredients:  Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, C12-15 Akyl Benzoate,  Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol  Mehtoxyphenyl Triazine, Glyceryl Behenate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl  Hexyl Benzoate, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Distearate, Sodium  Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Stearoyl Glutamic  Acid, Paraffin, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Ceresin, Isohexadecane, Arginine,  Lauryl Methacrylate/Sodium Methacrylate Crosspolymer, PEG-12  Dimethicone, Polysorbate 80, Dextrin Palmitate, Disodium EDTA, Agar,  Succinic Acid, BHT, Petrolatum, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol,  Methylparaben, Sodium Dehydroacetate",

Oily-Combo Skin that is Acne-Prone\n3. Hot-Humid Weather (Summers/Monsoon) + Cold-Dry Weather (Winters)\n\n*My primary skin concerns are controlling acne and fading PIH from previous zits.*\n\n**✅ How It Went:**\n\nI used this product religiously in the AM as well as PM as directed. 5 drops were enough to cover my face completely.\n\nThis is the first time I am taking skincare seriously and I had no idea how to select products. This product was a complete impulse purchase after being frustrated with my skin for very long (acne + PIH).\n\nThe serum is a milky white colour in the dropper that is barely visible once you take some in your hand.\n\n[All Pictures Included Here](https://imgur.com/a/bZ9Rj3S)\n\nThe consistency of the serum is a little thicker than water. It feels very *slightly* sticky for a couple of seconds when you put it on your skin but absorbs easily (as is expected from a serum).\n\nIn terms of using it under makeup, I never experienced any pilling. The formulation is very light-weight and with this product, you definitely never feel like you are wearing too much on your face.\n\nThe product also **does not contain fragrance** and should not cause irritation to sensitive skin girlies. However, people with niacinamide sensitivity should probably steer clear of this one.\n\n*Overall, in terms of the feel of the product on my face, it's a 5/5.*\n\nHowever, what matters most is the results which is where this product did not perform as I expected.\n\nI have been using this product for exactly 2 months (or 8 weeks) now. The same time period that Suganda claims is needed for this product to show results.\n\nHas this product shown results? I cannot say no. But has it been satisfactory for me? Honestly... Also no.\n\nMaybe this is just a me thing because my acne and PIH are moderately extensive in terms of severity but this product just did not deliver as much as it had promised.\n\nWithin the first month, there was a definite visible difference in my skin. Some of the lighter pigmentation had faded away for sure and my skin looked so much clearer than usual that 2-3 people commented on the difference.\n\nThis gave me a huge boost of confidence in this product and I kept applying it diligently, looking forward to what other changes it'll bring.\n\nHowever, that's where the progress pretty much stopped. Once all of my light pigmentation was sorted, this product became quite useless. For over a month now, there has hardly been any difference in my skin.\n\nIn fact, this serum did not help with some of the deeper pigmentation caused by new acne as well! I got a couple of hormonal acne 2 weeks ago that left behind pretty ugly marks. Unfortunately, this serum has not yet shown any effect on those.\n\nIt was a huge let down, ngl. After one month of miracles, it felt like the product had become a total dud and was not taking me anywhere useful in my skincare journey.\n\nThat's why I gave it an overall rating of 3/5 with a meh review. The initial benefits are great and I have no complaints with how the formula feels on my skin but this is honestly not a product worth the investment when you consider the price point at which it sells.\n\n**✅ In Conclusion:**\n\nIf you are someone who wants to target mild PIH then this serum is the best thing for you! It'll get rid of those pretty quick and you'll see a visible difference within a month.\n\nHowever, for all my acne prone girlies who have seen the ugly side of PIH, this serum would probably not benefit you that much. You might feel encouraged by the initial progress when some of your lighter PIH clears up quickly but trust me, that's the end of the road for this product.\n\nP. S. Since I am not repurchasing this serum, I'm switching to niacinamide from another brand and thinking of adding azelaic acid to my PM routine. Any suggestions for these two? Thanks!",

Plus, always here for combination products with multiple lightening ingredients 🙌🏼\n\n... TBH, two months to fade old acne marks is kind of short 😅 Even with new marks, I've never had a product prevent dark marks from forming, or even treat new marks super fast. The most I've noticed is that the mark isn't AS dark as if I wasn't using products targeting PIH. Still takes time to fade. The brand does mention that you'll see more results with prolonged use in 6 months. \n\nThe only thing that really helped speed things up is using multiple angles - so, lightening products AND exfoliation. A single product alone never gave me dramatic results. And even doing all that, when I'm happy with having some minor acne and PIH at any time, some of my dark marks from really inflamed, deeper pimples have been around for like... five or six months, even 🤔 Like, really faded, but they're still there. Granted, I have slow healing skin, and I'm in my early thirties, but PIH just takes time.\n\nI really enjoyed your review, OP, especially the clear formatting and the images!

    "body": "Hi guys,\n\nTwo months mark and I see some improvements. Main target was acne breakouts and atrophic scarring on cheeks. \n\nBefore tret I tried these actives: BHA from The Ordinary, Salyclic Acid from The Ordinary, Azelaic Acid from Skinoren, RetinAl from Geek and Gorgeous, Azelaic Acid from Revox, Vitamin C from Revolution Skincare, Vitamin C from Geek and Gorgeous, Niacinamide 10% + Zinc from Revolution Skincare. \n\nThe best from this list were: 1) BHA serum, made my skin glow, little breakouts using it but overdid it and damaged my skin barrier so I gained more and more breakouts because of the damage, didn't wear sunscreen. 2) RetinAl from Geek and Gorgeous, first retinal/retinol just to prep my skin for tretinoin (used it for two months from november until january), did awesome things for my skin, the best thing was reducing the texture in my atrophic scars. The rest was a waste of money, but made me realize I am: sensitive to ascorbic acid in Vitamin C, niacinamide. Worst breakouts after using those. Once I stopped it cleared.\n\nOn the way to today I discovered also that I have fungal \"acne\", so ditching all fungal unsafe products helped. \n\n2 months mark, my current simple routine is:\n\nAm:\n1) Cleanse with Bioderma Sensibio Micellar Wash (I use pump bottle so the micellar water comes out as a foam.) Washing my face in the morning with some PH balancing product was a huge game changer for me. I wasn't applying sunscreen to loads of products from the night routine, but to clean face so it helped with congestion. Water for me was not enough for cleansing, especially hard water that I have here. I could just feel the residue/film on my sitting on my face. \n2) Apply one layer of LRP Cicaplast B5 spray (holy grail, hydrating, calming, fungal acne safe, lightweight like a water). Wait for it to dry\n3) Another layer of LRP spray\n4) LRP UVMUNE 400 hydrating cream (2 fingers) \n\nPM, non tret night (two days in a row): \n1) Bioderma Sensibio H20 Micellar Water wash\n2) Geek and Gorgeous Jelly Joker gentle wash\n3) LRP Spray (two layers like in the am), wait for each layer to soak in\n4) cerave hydrating cream (looking for antifungal alternatives) \n\nTret night (every third night):\n\nAll the same, after step no. 3 i add vaseline around my eyelids, mouth and on nostrils. Wait for all to dry around 15 min. 4) apply tretinoin, pea size amount is confusing for me so I use 13 dots technique (3 dots on forhead, 3 on each cheek, two on nose and two on jawline / beard area) \n\nBiggest discoveries on this journey: waiting for each product to soak in on its own, not patting it dry, using PH balanced products, using non stripping products, cleansing in the morning with gentle cleanser that has Disodium EDTA or Trisodium EDTA (hard water is a b*tch), using ingredients like allantonin, panthenol, madecassoside, copper, on the resting days, sunscreen applied on thin layer of toner / serum vs after moisturizer, soo much nicer feeling when there is no moisturizer, more tretinoin is not better - rest days are so important for irritation prevention, skin steaming on rest days so my hydrating and calming products penetrate deeper into skin. IROHA tea tree pimple patches for small cysts. Food is important, I barely eat dairy, refined sugars, I workout and try to move as much as I can. I eat loads of fish, lean meats, veggies and whole grain foods. \n\nI still have breakouts if I do not eat properly, If I workout without removing my sunscreen (clean skin), I change pillowcase often and keep my enviroment really clean. If I stress to much I breakout. Normally, before my period I breakout (considering introducing spironolactone). \n\nI am waiting for purge to happen, I had a few nasty pimples mostly on my chin and neck but realized it was tretinoin irritation. I apply now with loads and loads of moisturizer underneath under chin because I believe skin is the thinnest there so irritation is likely to happen. My skin is still not perfect, but I can feel the rise in my confidence and happiness. Clear skin affects my mental health a lot, less breakouts = more smiles and happinesd, better mood, vibrant energy and overall hopefulless.",

While many people do apply tretinoin around their eyes, this can cause permanent damage to the oil glands in the eyes, and can result in permanently dry eyes. Remember that tretinoin travels up to 2\" below the skin, so you'll still get anti-aging benefits even if you don't apply right next to your eyes. Be safe, and protect your eyes: don't apply tretinoin near your eyes or on your eyelids. [Here's what the Mayo Clinic has to say about safe tretinoin application.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/tretinoin-topical-route/proper-use/drg-20066521#:~:text=Do%20not%20use%20this%20medicine,the%20tips%20of%20your%20fingers) (To learn more, search for \"Meibomian gland dysfunction\")\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The “Glycerol” product page title is a typo, as there is no glycerol in there.\n\n-\n\nRetinol & Niacinamide toner http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_9b0a443774.html\n\n> Aqua, Niacinamide, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Betaine, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Citrate, Ethylhexylglycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Panthenol, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxyacetophenone, Parfum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Jasminum Officinale Extract, Poloxamer 235, Retinol, Sodium Ascorbate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Epigallocatechin Gallate, Rosmarinus Officinalis Leaf Oil, BHT, Lavandula Angustifolia Oil, BHA, Jasminum Officinale (Jasmine) Oil, Linalool, Coumarin. \n\nRetinol is quite low down but this has 5% Niacinamide, so it should be a good “lots of Niacinamide but not as hefty as 10% Niacinamide” product, replacing the Simple soothing toner which never specified the exact content but has been reformulated to have less active ingredient since I last tested it, so here are some new tests and ingredients: https://imgur.com/a/QJhFAxZ\n\n-\n\nRose & hyaluronic acid toner http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_65a8443777.html\n\n> Aqua, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sambucus Nigra Flower Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Glycerin, Polysorbate 20, Propylene Glycol, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Parfum, Allantoin, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Sodium PCA, Bisabolol, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice Powder, Sodium Hyaluronate, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Hydroxide, Citronellol, Geraniol. \n\n-\n\n-\n\nRose oil http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8dcc443757.html\n\n> Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil, Punica Granatum Seed Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Parfum, Tocopherol, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis Peel Extract, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Citronellol, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate.\n\nHappy to see there are no plastics or silicones in there. Like the Pixi one it’s mostly almond and jojoba oil, plus (with the help of google) pomegranate, rosehip, vit E, orange peel extract, “sweet scented geranium”(?), rose flower oil, various fragrances. Wasn’t sure if there was any point testing this, as oils are said to “not have pH” (what) but this does appear to have a pH of approx. 5 (~face pH) https://imgur.com/rkvQeer\n\nI didn’t buy the Pixi version as it’s still £17+ on offer (at that point no), ingredients can be found at https://www.boots.com/pixi-rose-oil-blend-10256339\n\n-\n\nThese were all released in store today, toners are still available online and Aldi seem to have made more of them this time around. Rose oil is sold out online, *might* have to be quick to get it in the store.",

I have had very good experience with these ingredients before for calming my skin, but sadly this product did not work as expected. \n• I now use this when my skin is fine, to remove sunscreen as a first cleanse and it works well for that purpose.\n* **Repurchase Status:**WNRP\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n* **Product Name:** the dermaco AHA BHA foaming cleanser\n* *Review Type:** reject\n* **Price (range):** INR 349/100ML.

    "body": "Since I've been having a hard time finding reviews for foreign products (I'm in the USA) I thought I would review one and possibly help someone else out! This review is for [Avène Cleanance Sun Care SPF 50+](https://www.cocooncenter.co.uk/avene-cleanance-sun-care-spf-50-50ml/22947.html) I purchased this from Cocooncenter, a website that ships European products to loads of different countries!\n\n**My skin for reference:**\n\nExtremely oily, dehydrated, sensitive, not particularly acne-prone. My morning routine while trying this was just CeraVe foaming cleanser, Cosrx Centella toner, and this sunscreen.\n\n**Product name:** \n\nAvène Cleanance Sun Care SPF 50+ (50ml) - $13.62 USD before shipping from Cocooncenter.\n\n**Product type:** \n\nDaily use sunscreen\n\n**Product description:** \n\ntaken directly from the website - \"Avène Cleanance Sun Care SPF 50+ is a cream of very high protection specially formulated for oily to acne prone skin exposed to intense sunlight. This cream contains a photo-protective active complex which insure a high protection against all of the solar radiation UVB and UVA long and short. It also contains a powerful antioxidant, as well as monolaurin which allows to matify the skin thanks to its seboregulator action. Its light and fluid texture protects, moisturizes, and matifies the skin without leaving any white effect after its application.\"\n\n**Ingredients:** \n\nThis sunscreen is advertised as silicone and paraben free, and it also happens to be free of alcohol, oxybenzone, octinoxate, and most other American filters (contains avobenzone). This sunscreen would be considered reef safe to Hawaii's standards. Its filters are Tinosorbs M & S, Uvasorb HEB, and Avobenzone.\n\nAvene Thermal Spring Water (Avene Aqua), C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Methylene Bis-Benzatriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol [Nano], Cetearyl Isononanoate Water (Aqua), Disopropyl Adipate, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Glyceryl Laurate Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Benzoic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Glyceryl Behenate, Glyceryl Dibehenate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides Hydrogenated Palm Kernel Glycerides, Propylène Glycol, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl, Glucoside, Tribehennin, Xanthan Gum, Zinc Gluconate. \n\n**My opinion:** \n\nI wore this sunscreen for about a month before quitting (about three weeks ago). This sunscreen is quite matte. Definitely the most matte alcohol-free sunscreen I've ever tried. It is a thin lotion, but because of the high concentration of Tinosorbs it is slightly sticky and doesn't rub in very well. Once it dries, the stickiness is greatly reduced. It is a matte upon application, and stays matte for a few hours, but it is not \"mattifying\" in that it doesn't prevent my oil from shining through the sunscreen later in the day. I get greasy eventually, but it is still much better than any other sunscreen.\n\nIt leaves a slight white cast, mainly in streaks where I couldn't completely rub it in. After it completely dries, the white cast is mostly gone. It just stays white in patches around my nose and near my hairline. For reference, I am extremely pale, lighter-than-the-lightest-shade-of-foundation pale, so it would definitely show up white on anyone dark.\n\nThe sunscreen is very fragranced, and I can smell it all day long unless I apply makeup over it. It definitely irritates my senses and makes my skin itch when first applied. If you are sensitive to fragrance I would avoid this sunscreen. It didn't break me out, and is advertised for acne skin, so I can assume it will be safe for people who are acne prone. I ended up quitting on this sunscreen because I was too sensitive to the fragrance and couldn't wear it out of the house without foundation to hide the streaks.\n\n**Overall Rating:**\n\nI would rate this sunscreen 6.5/10 - it is matte, which I like, and it is free of alcohol/octinoxate/oxybenzone etc., which are big plusses. The cons, that kinda outweigh the pros, are that it is fragranced, slightly streaky, and difficult to rub in. I would not repurchase this sunscreen, it is just too expensive to ship for a very small/mediocre product. \n\n**Additional mini-review: Avène Sun Care Lip SPF 30 Lip Stick**\n\nThis SPF lip balm is AMAZING. Definitely the best lip balm I've tried with sun protection included. It uses the Tinosorbs and Avobenzone as filters. It has no nasty sunscreen taste, no weird texture. It's high protection to keep your lips safe from UVA. The only cons I have are that it's quite matte, and I prefer shiny lip balms. You could easily apply lip color on top of it for a day out. It also contains fragrance, but I don't notice it whatsoever. I give this a 9.5/10.\n\n[Avène Sun Care Lip SPF 30 Lip Stick - $6.33 USD / 3g](https://www.cocooncenter.co.uk/avene-sun-care-lip-spf-30-lip-stick-3g/12848.html) - Ingredients: Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil (Ricinys Communis Seed Oil), C 12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dipentaerythrityl Tetrahydroxystearate/Tetraisostearate, Ozokerite, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Beeswax (Cera Alba), Myristyl Lactate, Dimethicone, Esters, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Bis Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Copernica Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax (Cera Carnauba), VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Octocrylene, Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene Aqua), BHT, Decyl Glucoside, Parfum (Fragrance), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Propylene Glycol, Silica, Titanium Dioxyde, Tocopheryl Glucoside, Aqua, Xanthan Gum.\n\n**Overall, I feel that if you have oily, acne-prone skin that is not sensitive to fragrance and can handle a slight white cast, you could like this sunscreen. Most people would like the lip balm!**\n\nEdit: added some info",

For those of you unfamiliar with this line, it's produced by Etude House for sensitive and damaged skin types (my skin is both). It is my absolute favorite AB line so far, and I hope to review more of these products as I try them out (I am also obsessed with their pH-adjusting toner). You can find this one for about $10 on Amazon right now (I am located in the US).\n\nMy absolutely favorite thing about this product and Soon Jung in general is there is no fragrance whatsoever. It really doesn't smell like anything at all. I use the foam cleanser morning and night (after my oil cleanser at night), and my face always feels so soft afterwards, and never tight or \"squeaky\". However, it is effective at removing traces of oil following my oil cleanser. The lather is so rich and thick, and I only need about a pea-size amount for my whole face during each use. This is going to last forever! \n\nObviously, the pH of 5.5 is important as well. Not only is this close to the naturally acidic pH of skin, but it also keeps my pH low enough for my actives - like glycolic acid or salicylic acid - to be more effective (most of the ones I use are from The Ordinary, so they are not AB and won't be discussed here).\n\nThe ingredients list is fairly straightforward (taken from Amazon):\n\nWATER / AQUA / EAU, SODIUM COCOYL ISETHIONATE, GLYCERIN, COCO -BETAINE, POTASSIUM BENZOATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, CITRIC ACID, TROMETHAMINE, DISODIUM EDTA, PANTHENOL, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, MADECASSOSIDE\n\nI found citric acid (an AHA) to be an interesting ingredient, but the wash is still mild enough for daily use (or twice a day). \n\nThere is literally nothing about this wash I dislike and I don't see myself switching anytime soon. This gets a solid 5/5 stars from me for sensitive, damaged skin. This gets me super excited about trying more Soon Jung products!",

The concentration needed to keep the product pH stable is much lower than what would be needed to actually exfoliate. It’s just a convenient and cheap buffer which is widely tolerated and well established.",

I find it slightly less drying than the whip version too, cleanses my face well although it definitely wont get rid of makeup and sunscreen with silicones. the foam i got for $7 and the whip is around $13 where im from so thast def money saved.\n\nWill repurchase instead of the whip cleanser.

    "body": "So I recently read [this](https://simpleskincarescience.com/urea-for-skin/) blogpost detailing the benefits of urea. And they sound pretty all-around *amazing*. \n\nExcerpt from the blog about urea: \n> Urea is mainly known and used in dermatology for its keratolytic and hydrating properties. In other words, it hits the skin with a double whammy combo by both gently **exfoliating and moisturizing at the same time**. \n\n> Urea is part of the natural moisturizing factor (NMF) of skin, which is made up of 40% amino acids, 12% sodium PCA, 9% glycerol, and 8.5% urea (among other things). (3) These are all hygroscopic (water-holding) substances, that are essential for maintaining the health, function, and hydration of the stratum corneum. (4) \n\n>What’s super awesome about urea is that it works on both an external and cellular level! In other words, when applied to skin is decreases TEWL like most other moisturizers and whatnot, but it has an extended effect on the inner workings of skin. \n\n\n\nBut I've never really heard of urea on this sub, and that's what made me curious. Are there any urea creams in AB? For example, I happened across Cerave's new psoriasis cream with the second ingredient as urea:\n\n> **Active Ingredient:** Salicylic acid 2%\n**Inactive Ingredients:** Water, **urea**, glyceryl stearate SE, cetearyl alcohol, butyrosperum parkii (shea) butter, glycerin, cetearyl alcohol, **niacinamide**, laureth-9, limnanthes alba (meadowfoam) seed oil, PEG-100 stearate, gossypium herbaceum (cotton) seed oil, behentrimonium methosulfate, 1, 2-hexanediol, C12-13 alkyl lactate, dimethicone, tasmannia lanceolata fruit/leaf extract, **ceramid 3, ceramide 6-II, ceramide 1**, phytosphingosine, cholesterol, tocopherol, hydroxyacetophenone, hydrogenated olive oil, glyceryl stearate, disodium EDTA, sodium lauryl lactylate, xantham gum ,carbomer, **sodium hyaluonate**, sodium hydroxide \n\nBut that's pretty much the only urea based cream I've really seen around me... (I caved and slathered it on as a guinnea pig so we'll see how it goes). Have any of you tried an AB urea cream though? (including the hada labo mentioned in the post)  Or heard of one? If so, what were your experiences? \n\n",

I'm just a regular consumer buying everything with my own money - i.e., nothing sponsored, etc. Note, I've bought all of them on sale for around AUD$15-20 because I like sales haha.\n\nProducts:\n\n1. PKY - essence toner;\n2. PKY - mist toner;\n3. Secret Key - fresh nature toner - milk brightening one;\n4. Benton - Aloe BHA Toner;\n5. Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner; and\n6. Purito - Centella Green Level Calming Toner & the unscented version (Purito Unscented Centella Toner)\n\nMy skin used to be severely dry but is now slightly dry on the cheek areas and slightly oily on the t-zone during summer and slightly dry on the whole face in the winter.\n\nAlso note that the below two PKY products have different 'actives'/hero ingredients notwithstanding them seemingly being quite similar! I've bolded the plant extracts under the ingredient headers below.\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Essence Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495), Australian websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. *Note, this one is generally recommended for people with drier skin whereas the mist version is generally recommended for those with oilier skin* Friends with eczema have also used this with success. *.* I can use both year round without breaking out. I've had friends with oilier skin who've used this one and have broken out. YMMV.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** LOVE THIS. May repurchase this for the rest of my life. I've used this after breaking my moisture barrier, after chemical peels, after active masks, and also *after getting my face ablatively lasered (after the the initial few days of only using an ointment)*. It's REALLY benign in a godly way. If you want it to do anything other than hydrate or increase the penetration of your other actives, this isn't the product for you (note, it doesn't claim to do anything else apart from hydrate & calm really).\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a little bit thicker than water but not as thick as the Purito centella toners. Won't run off your hand/face like water will but will eventually run off.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** None at allll, even when I broke my moisture barrier.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? Yes**/I have rebought this 4 or so times so far.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Mist Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance. This is in a spray bottle and is better suited to oily skinned persons.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL.

This one is more for people with slightly oilier skin too. It's a lighter formula than the essence one.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Decent hydration, I prefer to use this in the toner stage instead of after my skincare but I have enjoyed using it as a 'refreshing' spray during the day.\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a nice mist, doesn't run on the face. Feels like a spray of water?\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a spray bit on top. I've had no issues with it but one mate had a couple that didn't spray properly.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** Unsure. I've rebought it once but haven't gone to use this one as much as I have the PKY essence toner or the Purito Unscented Centella Toner. I also don't like mists a whole bunch as they can go onto your clothes (if you're out) or jewellery if you're wearing any. But, I did go through a phase of keeping it in my handbag and using it when out and about for a bit of hydration.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Coptis Japonica Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Secret Key - Fresh nature Toner (Milk Brightening)**\n\n**What is it:** Hydrating toner that's meant to brighten your skin.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx.

Couldn't use it long enough to notice anything.\n\n**Smell:** A very strong scent that I could barely use it. I think I used it around 5-10 times before binning it - I couldn't even put up with the scent of this to use it on other parts of my body.\n\n**Feel:** really watery.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Fortunately (given the high fragrance), no reactions to this. If you had any irritation though, I'd expect some sort of reaction.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?

AUD$23. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/benton-aloe-bha-skin-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1053033537), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** people with sensitive and dry skin as it's quite rich.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** on and off since mid 2020, still using it randomly to just use it up.\n\n**My thoughts:** Per Google (may not be accurate), it has a pH of 5.5 which is too high for there to be any noticeable exfoliation with 0.5% BHA present. I've not noticed any calming effects. It is definitely hydrating but given it's advertised as a BHA toner I'm quite disappointed at the lack of BHA efficacy here. I would much rather use the purito centella toner to hydrate and calm my skin as the centella has other benefits such as helping to stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** Similar to the PKY essence toner. Not as thick as the purito centella toners.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a pump on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **No**, almost threw it out but am trying to use it up.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nAloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Water (80%), Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Beta-Glucan, Polyglutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea (Green Purslane) Extract, Psidium Guajava (Guava) Fruit Extract, Salicylic Acid (0.5%), Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract (200mg), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice (200mg), Arginine, Pentylene Glycol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Polysorbate 20, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**E**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804)**tude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 relief toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx.

It adds light hydration with benign ingredients - akin to the PKY toners but very minimally more expensive. It'd be good if you have irritated and/or dry skin.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** I used it once/twice a day until I used it up. Bought it in December 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Pretty decent. I'd recommend this to the same group of people who'd use the PKY essence toner. Nothing ground breaking. I prefer the calming nature of the Purito Unscented Centella Toner or even the PKY essence toner if you want zero actives (if you consider centella an 'active').\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** A watery toner.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** No but for no fault of the product. I just prefer using the Purito Unscented Centella one as it's just as benign, a bit cheaper, and has the benefits of centella.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, Propanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Madecassoside, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Polyglycerin-3, Disodium EDTA\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**Centella Green Level Calming Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804) **& the** [**Centella Unscented Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380)\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating and calming toner - may also stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$30 but I've always bought it on sale for approx. AUD$20-25 for 200mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380), [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml)\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone however this is best suited to those with any sort of irritation, acne, or redness. That is, if you have basically perfect skin you're probably not going to notice much of a difference but if you have irritation etc then you'll likely fall in love. Also good if you're wanting to help stimulate collagen production especially for the low price point - target ages for this is probably mid twenties and up.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** religiously since April 2020, sometimes twice a day.\n\n**My thoughts:** *BLOODY EXCELLENT*. I'm on my second bottle of this. My first bottle was the first listed one (scented) and then they released the unscented one so I bought that! It's incredible. I love it. In my opinion, it's partially why my skin is able to tolerate me using actives so much. It's excellent to use before actives as it doesn't interact with anything and really good to use after an 'active' mask or a clay mask etc. I switched to the unscented one to just reduce the risk of irritation.\n\n*also studies, which I haven't read but have seen derms I trust on insta etc, say that* ***centella can help stimulate/produce collagen... a big yes from me given it's a calming ingredient that shouldn't purge you or break you out*** *(unless you're allergic/sensitive to it)!*\n\n**Smell:** The scented one smells herbaceous (akin to Asian herbal medicine - I don't mind it but others may). The unscented one doesn't really smell like anything / I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** thick/fat/heavy water. Not a watery toner. Enjoyable.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Neverrrrrr, this helps me reduce the side effects from using actives such as retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, etc.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **Yes** & I have. Will probably rebuy for life.\n\n**Ingredients:** 4 variants as they've got the scented and unscented versions, and then those with and without witch hazel\n\nnon-witch hazel unscented version -\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract (strengthens skin barrier), Butylene Glycol (humectants), Pentylene Glycol (skin-conditioning agents), Dipropylene Glycol (humectants), 1,2-Hexanediol (stabilizers), Trehalose (humectants), Sodium Hyaluronate (natural moisturizing factor/ humectants), Hamemelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiaticoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiatic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Madecassic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Panthenol (strengthens skin barrier), Carbomer (viscosity increasing agents), Allantoin (skin protectants), Arginine (skin-conditioning agents), Portulaca Oleracea Extract (skin-conditioning agents), Ethylhexylglycerin (skin-conditioning agents), Disodium EDTA (stabilizers)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope these reviews were useful & feel free to ask any questions / start any discussions :)",

    "body": "Hi All,\n\n\n\nSomeone posted a thread asking for an affordable sunscreen recommendation, and I thought I'd share the comment again.\n\nI actually made a post about it last year, but obviously it's gone to the bottom of the list. I hope it's okay to post about it again, since summer is very soon.\n\n\nI also kind of want more people to buy it. It feels sad that not many people know about it, when in my opinion it's really good. I have tried la Roche posay, nivea uv face, and I really think this one is better. But of course be careful and check the ingredient list!\n\n\nHere was my comment:\n\n\nI really like the asda sun cream which I have been using for 2 years now since discovering it one day - ASDA Protect SPF 50+ Face Q10 Anti-Age Sun Cream. I have the most sensitive skin, probably one of the most sensitive skin types you will ever meet due to my chronic eczema, and this one doesn't irritate me at all. To be honest, in the last year my eczema has been under control, and I was using this, so I can't say that it worsened my skin.\n\n\nIts only £2.40 so I think it's worth a try, and its UVA rating is very high- more than my nivea face uv sunscreen for £15ish (which burns my eyes). The only issue is that it's not matte. For me that's ok, as it covers my cracked and flaky skin. But you might want to try their matte version, which is the same price. If you want to try this one I am happy to take a picture/video of its consistency for you?\n\n\nHere are its ingredients:\nAqua, Octocrylene, Glycerin, Alcohol Denat., C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Titanium Dioxide (Nano), Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Tapioca Starch, Coco-Caprylate, Undecane, Tocopheryl Acetate, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Silica, Panthenol, Caprylyl Glycol, Parfum, Tridecane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Xanthan Gum, Dimethicone, Disodium EDTA, Ubiquinone, Sodium Hydroxide, Carbomer, Benzyl Alcohol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Citronellol, Limonene, Tocopherol, Linalool, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil\n\n\n\nI hope this helps, and good luck.",

        "body": "Hey OP, just wanted to give my opinion on this. After seeing this post I went out and grabbed some as I have an ASDA close-by. I have dry-normal sensitive skin and wanted to give it a try considering the great price. Only been using it today so its only a first impression but so far, so good! \n\nNo cast, sinks in nicely though it did leave me a bit greasy initially but after 10 mins or so it faded and looked normal, can barely tell I even had it on. I cut out my morning moisturizer as I figured it would be rich enough to cover that as well and I was right. I definitely wouldn't moisturize then apply this, the SPF is all I need. \n\nI have notoriously sensitive eyes so admittedly I haven't tried it in that area yet as I had to go out and didn't want to risk burning eyes so I used my usual SPF (the bondi sands one) and then applied the ASDA one everywhere else and I've had no issues. \n\nI will be trying it around the eyes tomorrow though as I'm not going anywhere. You may have just saved me a lot of future money OP so thanks! Even if it doesn't work around the eyes I can at least apply it to the rest of the face and use my usual in that area meaning it will last longer so its win/win really.\n\nUPDATE: So I've now tried it around the eyes and it felt fine for the first couple of hours, however after that I did experience some very mild burning in the eye area. Having said that, when I say \"very mild\" I mean really, really mild. If I was out and about I probably wouldn't even notice it as it only lasted a couple of minutes and then stopped. \n\nI would still class this as a success. Mild for me is still an improvement over most SPF's I've tried since my eyes are so sensitive. I will continue to use this and possibly just use my usual SPF around my eyes and the ASDA one on the rest of my face. Which will make my more expensive one last a lot longer since its only going to be used in the eye area.",

    "body": "This is a pretty long review that I have been adding to and compiling for a long time, so please bear with me. Hair and climate details are:\n\n**Hair and scalp type:**\n\n3A/2C curls, very dry and course strands, low-porosity, silicone and protein sensitive, oily scalp. I am not sensitive to fragrance, and find the fragrance of these products very mild. However that might be different for other people.\n\n**Climatic conditions:**\n\nHot and Humid.\n\n**Age range:**\n\nTwenties.\n\n**Usage timeline:**\n\nThe Moisture Duo have been my favourite styling products for about two years now.\n\nThe Protein Duo was bought approximately a year ago and has been used intermittently for 6-8 months since then.\n\nThe Wash-Day products were also bought at around the same time, and I have regularly used the Cleansing Shampoo and the Conditioner every wash-day since.\n\n# ✨Wash-Day Bundle✨\n\n# 🔹Cleansing Shampoo\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua),Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Panthenol, Polyquaternium -7, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-73, Fragrance, Apple Cider Vinegar, Disodium EDTA, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Oil, Polyquaternium -10, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick gel that lathers into a thick foam.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit while massaging into hair, completely washes off on rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nIt is sulphate-free so it is only mildly cleansing. If you are not prone to a lot of build-up and don’t have dandruff, this is good enough. Does not strip off moisture from the hair strands and doesn’t dry out the scalp either. I use this as my regular shampoo and use a sulphate shampoo every once in a while to clarify any build-up since this shampoo isn’t enough for me.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nEven though this is a cleansing shampoo, the website clearly states that this is not a Clarifying Shampoo. They actively encourage using a sulphate shampoo if you are prone to build-up, which I thought was a refreshing change from the usual marketing of sulphate-free shampoos.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n## 🔹Everyday Moisturising Shampoo\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua) Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium -7, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Panthenol, Phospholipids (and) Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/Palmitate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-73, Cetrimonium Chloride, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Fragrance Polyquaternium -10, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Citrus Aurantium (Neroli) Oil\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Mild to no lather.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit while massaging into hair, completely washes off on rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nI did not like this shampoo at all. It didn’t clean my scalp well at all and the strands felt weirdly brittle after washing. It isn’t hydrating enough to use without following up with a conditioner. However, if I am going to be using a conditioner anyway, the additional step is pointless for me. It might work for someone who needs extremely mild cleansing, but it is not for me. I stopped using after 2-3 washes at most, and switched full-time to the cleansing shampoo alone. Though the fact that this shampoo has proteins might be contributing to my dislike of it.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n1/5. Will Not Repurchase.\n\n## 🔹Hydrating Deep Conditioner\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Quaternium-87, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Phospholipids, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Polyquaternium -7, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/​Palmitate, Polyquaternium-73, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Avena Sativa (Oats) Extract, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Tamanu Oil, Honey Extract, Goji Berries Oil, Taraktogenos Kurzii Seed Oil, Jojoba Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Oil, Disodium EDTA, Magnolia Grandiflora Bark Extract, Potassium Lauroyl Wheat Amino Acids, Nigella Sativa Seed Oil, Leptospermum Scoparium Branch/​Leaf Oil, Capryloyl Glycine, Cysteine\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Low to medium slip.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit even after rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis conditioner is protein-moisture balanced, and this is the max protein my hair will tolerate. It doesn’t have a lot of slip, so if you are someone who detangles with conditioner, this one might be difficult to detangle with. My hair is always dry, and it felt softer immediately on the first use with this. It does tend to make hair a little greasy afterwards. But after adding styling products, it works out for me so I don’t really mind the greasiness. I have also used it as a deep conditioner and kept it in my hair for 30 minutes and then washed off. It didn’t make much of a difference in comparison with leaving it in for 5 minutes like I usually do, so I didn’t bother to do that again.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nFMC says the conditioner can also be used as a leave-in conditioner, though I have never tried this myself, and do not plan to try either.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Protein Duo✨\n\n## 🔹Leave-in Cream\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Dicetyl Phosphate & Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Panthenol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-87, Polyquaternium -7, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/Palmitate, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acids, Sodium PCA, Hydrolysed Milk Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Cetrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Polyquaternium-68, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Ceramide, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Fragrance, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Tocopheryl Acetate, Potassium Lauroyl Wheat Amino Acids, Nigella Sativa Seed Oil, Leptospermum Scoparium Branch/Leaf Oil, Disodium EDTA, Magnolia Grandiflora Bark Extract, Taraktogenos Kurzii Seed Oil, Capryloyl Glycine\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Thins out a little on emulsifying.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHeavy fragrance that lasts for the whole day. This is the only FMC product whose fragrance is too much for me.\n\n**Review:**\n\nI purchased the Protein Duo when I was still experimenting and figuring out the needs of my hair. I very quickly realised that my hair is protein-sensitive and this cream does not work for me. Thankfully I had only bought the 50g travel pack. It is very protein-heavy, not very hydrating. If your hair is already healthy, this may work well. However for very dry hair, this will not provide enough moisture.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nI know now that the cream doesn’t work for me in regular usage. However I do keep the 50g tube around for the rare moisture-overload days to give my hair a little boost of protein. I only need a tiny amount for that purpose, so the tube is going to last me a very long time.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n1/5. Will Not Repurchase. Didn’t work for me, might work for someone else.\n\n## 🔹Defining Hair Gel\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Polyacrylate-2 Crosspolymer, Phospholipids (and) Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Polyquaternium -7, Polyquaternium-73, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Panthenol, Fragrance, Disodium EDTA\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nVery sticky, thick gel.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays for a few minutes, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis is a very strong-hold gel. It is a part of the Protein Duo, but it isn’t as protein-heavy as the leave-in cream. Even with my protein-sensitive hair, I was able to use it occasionally on days when I wanted some serious definition. If I used it 2-3 times consecutively, it caused protein-overload. Overall, a nice gel that gives pretty good definition and hold. I haven’t bought it again, though I might do so once my current hoard of gels is finished.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n3/5. May repurchase sometime.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Moisture Duo✨\n\n## 🔹Curl-Quenching Hair Butter\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Extract, Salvia Hispanica(Chia) Seed Extract, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-87, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Panthenol, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond Oil), Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Glycerin, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, PEG/​PPG-8/​3 Diisostearate, Astrocaryum Vulgare Kernel Oil, Tocopherol, Olea Europea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Euterpe Oleracea (Acai) Fruit Oil, Mauritia Flexuosa (Buriti) Fruit Oil, Fragrance, Polyquaternium-73\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick white cream. Emulsifies into a thinner non-sticky cream.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nMild fragrance that lingers around for a few hours, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis one is an extreme boost of hydration. It is a heavy product, and tends to make hair greasy if too much is used. Since my hair is very dry, this works really well to keep it considerably soft and frizz-free. It doesn’t help me a lot with definition though, I don’t feel my hair is more defined on the days I use this butter as opposed to some other leave-in cream (usually the green Arata styling cream). Since it is heavy, it might weigh down wavy or fine hair. But for tighter curl patterns and/or coarser drier hair, this is great.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nThe product label mentions that it can be used as a one and done styling product. But for better definition, I prefer always using the gelly with it.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased. \n\n## 🔹Curl-Quenching Flaxseed Gelly\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Extract, Sorbitol, Propanediol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Salvia Hispanica (Chia! Seed Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-73, Panthenol, Sodium Gluconate, Fragrance, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Vinegar\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThin to medium, non-sticky gel.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays for a few minutes, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis is protein-free and quite hydrating honestly. Has a lot of slip, so it is a nice experience to style. It doesn’t have a lot of hold. Curls last for a day or two maximum, and that is after all protective measures like a satin pillowcase, satin scrunchies, etc. If long-lasting curls are not a goal for you, and you don’t mind refreshing more frequently, I would highly recommend this. The Moisture Bundle would probably be my most highly recommended FMC products.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nThe product label mentions that it can be used as a one and done styling product. I do use it as my sole styler sometimes, and it works out fine.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Miscellaneous Notes About Fix My Curls✨\n\nFix My Curls website used to have the full ingredients list of their products on the product pages prominently displayed. However during their recent website update, they have replaced it with Key Ingredients. So, minus points for that from me.They do have a photo of the back label in the product images, which shows the ingredients, but I feel that is not good enough. I prefer having the ingredients easily accessible. \n\nThey always have some kind of sale, discount offers, freebie offers, etc on their website. A lot of Indian Curly Hair Influencers also have affiliate codes for FMC. If you are planning to buy anything, I’d recommend comparing prices from the official seller on Amazon and the website during sales. I would have included other platforms like Nykaa, Foxy, Purpple, etc, but they are pretty much always out of stock or very highly priced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ✨Frequently Asked Questions✨\n\n🔹How do I find my curl type/porosity?\n\nI used [this quiz](https://www.naturallycurly.com/quiz)!\n\n🔹How do I know whether my hair needs moisture or protein?\n\n[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/mzhv17/haircare_guide_to_proteinmoisture_balance/) might help.\n\n&#x200B;",

Thank you for the reviews.\n\nI've seen FMC go upto 35%off on kindlife & 30%off on their own website.\n\nEdit - I have fine 2a wavy hair, & medium porosity from what I can tell. I'm hair dumb tbh. I use FMC leave in cream, hair mousse & defining hair gel & quite like them as they don't weigh down my hair while making them soft enough. Provide moderate hold & don't make them look crunchy. \n\nI agree with your assessment that they don't provide much moisture. So sm1 with Frizzy or dry hair would need other more rich / moisturizing products.\n\nThe leave in cream & mousse are my more used products, I haven't quite figured out how to use the gel properly yet.",

    "body": "I was already skeptical when I bought it as an add-on, but I figured for $3 bucks it didn't hurt... Now I'm wondering if I should even put it on my face. \n\n\n1. There are basically no reviews anywhere outside of the official website. There's reviews on Nordstrom's, but they're all *reposted from the company's site*. The positive reviews didn't mention anything specific--\"Really pleasant serum and effects on the skin to suit.\" the few reviews seem fake as FUCK in my opinion. I found one more site that has reviews, but still, few reviews and a little generic. \n\n\n2. Packaging says it's **made in China**. Sorry, what the fuck?? A purportedly $350 cream is *made in China*? A company with very little info, very few reviews, making stuff in China? Alarm bells going off here, esp with regulation of ingredients. Not that China automatically means bad quality, but it's not a great sign for a no-name company. \n\n\n3. The **ingredients don't match the official site**. What the what?!\n\nHere's what the back of my sample said:\n\n\nWater, Sorbitol, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Bis - PEG - 18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Diazolidinyl Urea, Sodium PCA, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Hyaluronate, Disodium EDTA, Niacinimide, Panthenol, Carrageenan Extract, Propylene Glycol, Acrylic Acid Copolymer, PVM/MA Copolymer, Beta-Glucan, Chlorphenesin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Maltodextrin, BHT, Aesculus Hippocastanum Seed Extract, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Atecyl Cysteine, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Soybean Oil, Citric Acid, Calendula Officinalis Extract, Tocopherol, Fragrance. \n\nAnd here's the ingredients list from the official site:\n\n\nGLYCERIN, AQUA / WATER / EAU, SORBITOL, ISOPROPYL MYRISTATE, ALOE BARBADENSIS (ALOE VERA) EXTRACT, CALENDULA OFFICINALIS EXTRACT, ALCOHOL, CARBOMER, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, AESCULUS HIPPOCASTANUM (HORSE CHESTNUT / MARRON) SEED EXTRACT, SODIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE, ACETYL CYSTEINE, PANTHENOL, NIACINAMIDE, THIAMINE, RIBOFLAVIN, PYRIDOXINE, CYANOCOBALAMIN, DISODIUM EDTA, FRAGRANCE / PARFUM.\n\n\nCan anyone explain to me why the ingredients themselves would be different, and in the wrong order?? A lot of the ingredients not officially listed, like BHT and Diazolidinyl Urea, don't have great results on CosDNA.... And overall, I don't see any special ingredients beyond a few basic moisturizers, a bunch of preservatives, etc. Like, nothing that would make this worth $$$. \n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nHas anyone tried it? What are your results so far? I guess I'll still give it a try, but the fact that it's made in China (definitely potential ingredient contamination) and the ingredients aren't listed correctly makes me very skeptical... What's your take?\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/niANANe.jpg",

        "body": "This sounds like it might be a private label product, made by whoever in China and repackaged by a company that specifically sells/vends to beauty boxes. That there is no other information on this product online, it’s only appearance is in this beauty box, indicates a PLM product. Beauty box companies routinely pair with companies who private label their (inexpensively sourced) products and put a high price tag on it to make it seem like an amazing deal. \n\nSome people on this sub HATE any talk of private labeling in beauty boxes, they don’t want their bubble burst of how “great a deal!” their boxes and the products in them seem to be. Some brands seem to only exist in beauty boxes (Doucce, Laritzy, Starlooks, Micabeauty, The Beauty Crop, Be A Bombshell, Mirabella, etc). There are tons more, I’ve only subbed to Play and Allure lately so I’m a little behind. I suspect most or all of the brands I listed are private label. \n\nYou can usually tell because the brand’s presence is entirely online (outside of boxes) and the actual website will be a little “off.” A bit of a DIY template look. Real brands that manufacture their own products will usually sell in retail stores and have a custom website. Private label brands won’t because that shit costs money and they’re all about repackaging inexpensively-sourced products that another company made. \n\nIt’s a huge thing in the beauty industry right now. I’m not against private labeling, I just think a lot of people are being misled about “box values” with these inflated prices. Things are ultimately worth what you pay for them I guess but when someone posts how their “$20 box has a $300 value!” I roll my eyes a bit every time lol.\n\nSephora Play has had the fewest amount of PLM products in their boxes, which is why the samples are smaller and less varied-seeming. They seem to only have items in their boxes that they sell in their stores. Ipsy used to have a TON but they seem to send more higher-quality brands lately. Allure seems to be going down that road (Juvia’s Place, LASplash, etc). Most of the eye palettes in Boxycharm are from private label manufacturers, for example. Brands that just pop up out of nowhere in a beauty box, then just keep showing up in beauty boxes only. \n\nThis isn’t just true for beauty boxes though, it’s the case all across the entire beauty industry. I read somewhere that up to 80% or department store products are made by private label manufacturers. It’s just more obvious in beauty boxes because the same brands repeat over and over. When really, a good chunk of the products are made by the same larger companies and factories overseas, regardless of what brand name it says on the packaging. And the websites of beauty box brands seem more homemade and template-y.",

This review will be mainly overall experience, with some recent insights. I have more products that I have used in the past, but I decided to only review ones I have a lot of experience with so far. The only product I don't have reviewed from my routine is the Advanced Retinoid - as I just reintroduced that back into my routine in the last week.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**My current routine:**\n\n*AM*\n\n1.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n2.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n3.\tTO Niacinamide over whole face\n4.\tApply TO Caffeine to under eye\n5.\tFormula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free moisturizer over whole face\n6.\tIf using sunscreen, use Etude House Sunprise\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*PM*\n\n1.\tIf wearing makeup, I use baby oil to remove\n2.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n3.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n4.\tPaula’s Choice 2% BHA Gel to whole face – wait ~20 mins to sink in\n5.\tTO Retinoid Advanced Retinoid 2% over whole face\n6.\tMoisturize with Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Info about my skin/general experience trying out products:**\n\n* VERY oily t-zone, normal cheeks, normal-to-dry jaw line and around mouth; light-to-medium skin tone\n* VERY VERY CC-prone, mainly on my forehead (some on chin). This is mainly due to not being consistent with my routine (especially simply washing my face with a cleanser, which is the minimum I need). This can also occur from moisturizer.\n* No issues with acne, except a few whiteheads around my menstrual cycle\n* Most cleansers I have tried are either a) not strong enough or b) too strong\n* Main skin concerns: Oil control, reducing appearance of giant nose pores, preventing CCs, even skin tone, healthy aging\n* Slowly trying to reduce the number of products I use for all the things (not just skin care) that contain fragrances\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser](https://imgur.com/a/uAvebDj)\n\n***Product Type:*** Cleanser; specifically purchased because it is **sulfate free** (my body hates sulfates)\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Juice, Coco-Betaine, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Peg-50 Shea Butter, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Lycium Barbarum Fruit Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Morinda Citrifolia Fruit Extract, Punica Granatum Juice Extract, Garcinia Mangostana Fruit Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Benzoic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Red 33\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance free**; **Sulfate free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; AM: use with konjac sponge; Fragrance is actually pleasant, doesn’t linger; consistency starts off creamy, but foams very easily\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is amazing, and has been a major game-changer for me when it comes to cleansers. I’ve never found a cleanser that worked long-term before this one. A little goes a long way with this stuff – it is a very efficient clean. My face feels so soft afterwards. While it is strong enough to get rid of all my oil, it’s not so harsh that it makes my skin tight.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** In terms of function, none that I can think of. Only downfall (IMO) is it is not fragrance-free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4.5/5 stars, I’ve gone through over 4-5 bottles of this stuff and I will keep it in rotation until I can find a functionally similar product that is fragrance-free\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Thayer’s Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner](https://imgur.com/a/OwCREGs)\n\n***Product Type:*** Toner; purchased because of how many people liked it on ScA\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~0.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Purified Water, Certified Organic Witch Hazel Ext Blend (Hamamelis Virginiana Extract (Witch Hazel*), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (Filet of Aloe Vera*)), Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Water, Fragrance (Natural Rose), Citric Acid, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Seed Extract\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** ***Not fragrance-free***; Liquid consistency; potentially irritating, depending on your skins relationship with witch hazel\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Despite the smell (see below), this stuff works pretty well. I always feel like this enhances my *clean* feel following my cleanse, but it also leaves my skin feeling refreshed and moisturized. I always follow-up with moisturizer, but I can definitely tell when I don’t use it, especially in my dry areas.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** **I HATE THE SMELL OF THIS STUFF!** Come to find out, I hate the smell of roses (I’m weird, I know…) but seriously. This stuff smells like a rose pooped in some water and then sold it on the side of the road on a hot sunny day. It’s terrible. If you are remotely disinterested in the smell of rose, do not buy this.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5 due to smell. Will repurchase the fragrance-free version in the future\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%](https://imgur.com/a/Tuo5otO)\n\n***Product Type:*** Purchased to reduce redness/even skin tone and to control oil; side-benefits: helps prevent CCs\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mild medicinal smell**, doesn’t linger; Somewhat-sticky consistency; Absorbs quickly\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** I keep this in rotation mainly because it helps control my oil. Even if I use this stuff without my mattifying moisturizer, it helps prevent the massive amounts of oil that my skin normally produces. It helps keep my skin an even texture and tone, as well. I’m not 100% sure if this is solely responsible for preventing my CC (doubt it, since I use BHA), but I’m almost certain it’s contributing at the least. This product has been one that I have been most consistent with besides my cleanser and what little redness I sometimes develop (mainly due to allergies or weather) has been under control.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Functionally, none. This stuff does what it’s supposed to. I just hate the dropper packaging, personally, of most TO products. It’s hard to get the little bits out of the bottom!!\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, have repurchased 2+ times; will be replacing with skinlex’s version to avoid buying more products from Deciem.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG](https://imgur.com/a/roT93Vy)\n\n***Product Type:*** Active for reducing appearance of eye contour pigmentation\n\n***Cost:*** **$* - ~$7.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Caffeine, Maltodextrin, Glycerin, Propanediol, Epigallocatechin Gallatyl Glucoside, Gallyl Glucoside, Hyaluronic Acid, Oxidized Glutathione, Melanin, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Urea, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Xanthan gum, Lactic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Propyl Gallate, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Benzyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; Watery-to-thick consistency (from the glycerin, probably); no noticeable smell; yellow-ish in color\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I’ve been using this stuff for a little over a year, and honestly it does absolutely nothing for my eye contour. I don’t have much puffiness, but I do have decent enough under eye darkness where I wanted something to help. This does not. It does help reduce the appearance with some small, visible blood vessels around my nose, but it’s only a temporary effect thereby reducing redness. \n\n***Bad stuff:*** It doesn’t really work for what I wanted it to work for.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 1/5, WNRP.\n\n*Does anyone have any suggestions of what I can do with what I have leftover? I’d love to use it for something else if it’s functional!*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free Mattifying Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/rQeCSUV)\n\n***Product Type:*** Daytime moisturizer; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Propylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethicone, Ceteareth-20, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Silica Silylate, Behenyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Salicylic Acid, Panthenol, Fragrance, Boron Nitride, Bambusa Arundinacea (Bamboo) Stem Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Maltodextrin, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance-free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; very thick consistency; absorbs quickly; powdery/soft finish\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** Another game-changer with my oily skin. Using this moisturizer during the day saves my face from producing oil. Even if I sweat a little bit, it controls oil. Normally, without it, I’ll start producing oil within a few hours of cleansing. If I use this moisturizer, I’m relatively oil-free all day, except around my nostrils. This is also a strong enough moisturizer to keep my dryness at bay, even during the wintertime (and where I live gets very cold during the winter).\n\n***Bad stuff:*** The smell is pretty bad (probably the bamboo), but honestly I get used to it and the smell goes away quickly. My friend said it smells like wet dog... haha but I don't notice it anymore since I've been using it for so long.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, only because it’s not fragrance-free. Will continue to repurchase until I can find a fragrance-free alternative.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Sun Milk SPF50+/PA+++](https://imgur.com/a/kXZLXCa)\n\n***Product Type:*** Sunscreen; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.40 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dipropylene Glycol, Titanium Dioxide, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Viscum Album (Mistletoe) Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Carex Humillis Root Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Pinus Sylvestris Leaf Oil, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Malpighia Emarginata (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Echium Plantagineum Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Peg-10 Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Magnesium Sulfate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Methicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Aluminum Hydroxide, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Octyldodecanol, Dimethicone, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-6 Polyricinoleate, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Butylene Glycol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Cellulose Gum\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mineral sunscreen**; **Not fragrance-free**; **Mild whitecast**, but absorbs well; **Drying**; mattifying/oil-control like a boss; pleasant scent; not waterproof\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Due to drying my skin out, I only use this product when I have to. I don’t wear SPF most days (work inside, very little exposure to sun during the day), but I do wear this when I’m running errands and/or trying to control my oil more than I can with the moisturizer mentioned previously. This stuff works really well to control oil – the best of any product I’ve tried so far. Wears well under makeup, as long as my dry skin is kept controlled. Some minor white cast, but with my skin it absorbs and isn’t visible (even when I’m tanner) – but may not be the same on someone with a darker than medium skin tone.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** This product is very drying. It works SO WELL on controlling oil, but it zaps any amount of moisture out of my dry spots. To the point where I have to counteract the dryness in my PM routine. Do not recommend for people with sensitive skin, or dry skin.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 3/5, due to drying and not being fragrance-free; Will continue to repurchase until I find an alternative that controls my oil as well as this does, if ever.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Paula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Gel Exfoliant](https://imgur.com/a/X9YEexN)\n\n***Product Type:*** Chemical exfoliant; meant to prevent/reduce CCs and help with overall skin texture\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$8.80 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, (hydration), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Phytosphingosine (skin-renewing), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Vitis Vinifera Seed Extract (grape extract/antioxidant), Camellia Sinensis Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (green tea/antioxidant) Epilobium Angustifolium Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (willow herb/skin-soothing), Bisabolol (skin-soothing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH-adjusting), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; **BHA**; thick consistency, absorbs slowly\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is AMAZING! It attacks any signs of CCs overnight, and can easily clear my CC-prone forehead within a day or two. I use it almost every day as a preventative. My face has been noticeably clearer and smoother thanks to this product. Also, it visibly reduces the appearances of pores - this combined with the retinol I use has been an amazing in reducing their appearance.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Smells chemical, so may be off-putting to some people. Absorbs slowly, so you should leave room in your routine for that.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, WRP. I am going to be trying to the liquid version (I got it on sale), but if this works better for me over the liquid I will come back to it\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/BDGVfpd)\n\n***Product Type:*** PM moisturizer; light-weight\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$9.50 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Dimethicone/vinyl Dimenticone Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethaqnol, Polyacrylamide, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Dimethiconol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, C12-14 Pareth -12, Sodium Hydroxide, Blue 1\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **NOT Fragrance-free**; **Contains silicones**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; **Contains hyaluronic acid**; Very light-weight moisturizer.\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I love this product. It was the first moisturizer I tried when I embarked on my skincare journey, and I am so thankful I found it. This is the first moisturizer I used every in my life that didn’t break me out or lead to a forehead full of CCs. I’m in love with this stuff! It is light enough for my super oily spots (which is not due to being dry, it’s just oily…) and is strong enough for my dry spots. In the winter I use a little extra HA serum over my whole face and it works like a charm. I’ve been dabbling with some oils as well, but so far I haven’t found it necessary in the summer because this moisturizer works so well!\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Nothing, just that it’s not fragrance free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, because of fragrance. Will continue to RP until I can find an alternative that I can afford and is fragrance free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading, everyone! I hope this is helpful, as I use some products that you don't see a lot around here (as well as some you do...). This is definitely a more simplified version of my routine, but that may be a good thing, as I'm noticing the same effects as to what I was seeing before despite reducing the number of products I use!",

I have no connection to L’Herboflore or Beautibi, other than being an enthusiastic customer willing to hand over a lot of my money. The only things I received for writing this review are firm, bouncy skin and a sore wrist.]**\n\n**[Also, there aren't any photos because it's evening here, and there are too many shadows, but I link to some sites where you can see pictures.]**\n\nOn a trip to Taiwan last October, I sought out the L’Herboflore stand in the Taipei 101 building, eager to get my hands on some sheet masks. Much to my surprise, I discovered that L’Herboflore carries a lot of products that aren’t sheet masks, such as cleansers, a toner, eye cream, exfoliating gel, moisturizers, body lotion, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and powdered health drinks. I purchased a couple of these non-sheet mask items that I’ll review down the road (I still need to finish testing them), and I’ve been impressed enough with them that when I saw that the U.S. site Beautibi stocks some L’Herboflore products, I decided to order the Aqua Plus Moisturizing Toner, something I regretted not picking up in Taipei. Aside from the fact that L’Herboflore products have impressed me, I was eager to incorporate more Taiwanese products, other than sheet masks, into my routine, since T-Beauty doesn’t get as much love around here as products from Korea, and to a lesser extent, Japan. \n\n*The low-down: what is this product?*\n\nThe L’Herboflore 蕾舒翠  [Aqua Plus Moisturizing Toner 水盈潤晶露](http://www.lherboflore.com.tw/product_detail.aspx?series=9&classid=29&id=88)   (hereafter known as Aqua Toner) is a hydrating toner that is part of [L’Herboflore’s Aqua Plus line](http://www.lherboflore.com.tw/product_list.aspx?series=9&classid=29), which features products made from organic cactus elixir. The company claims that this toner will soothe irritated skin, hydrate one’s skin, and protect and firm one’s skin. \n\n*Ingredients:*\n\n(I don’t know if Taiwanese ingredients are listed in the same order as in the U.S., so I’m not sure how important the order is here; list is taken from the product box, which is slightly different from the Beautibi website) \n\nAqua (Water), Propanediol, Glycosyl Trehalose, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Propylene Glycol, Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Glycerin, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Stem Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Polysaccharides, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tremella Fuciformis Polysaccharide, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Fragrance, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, O-CYMEN-5-OL. \n\nI put the ingredients into [Cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_479b233703.html). Please keep in mind that just because something isn’t flagged in Cosdna doesn’t mean it won’t be a problem for you. Similarly, Cosdna often flags things that are generally safe as being potentially unsafe as it doesn’t take into account the small concentration used in skin care products. In any case, please do not use this product if you have a known allergy or sensitivity to any of the above ingredients, and always patch test and isolation test new products. \n\n*According to Cosdna, the potentially acne-causing/unsafe ingredients (anything flagged a 3 or higher) are:*\n\n**Propylene glycol**, which is a humectant, receives a 3 for safety. Some people claim that it’s the same thing as antifreeze and that it’s a strong skin irritant. Paula’s Choice rates it as Good and explains that it’s used only in a tiny amount in skin care products (versus the amount you would find in antifreeze) and thus should not be an issue, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services does not deem it carcinogenic. You’ll find this ingredient in a lot of products, including baby wipes, lip sticks, shampoos and conditioners, and moisturizers. I’ve seen it in a lot of my other products, and I’m still alive. \n\nThe only potential acne trigger is **Triethanolamine**, which is pretty low at 2, but gets a 5 for safety. What is this supposedly dangerous substance? Triethanolamine is primarily used to adjust pH, but it also functions as an emulsifier. It’s found in various cosmetics, hair products, shaving creams, and sunscreens, in addition to some skin care products. The FDA has approved it as being safe for use as long as it is in a concentration below 5%. Various sources I checked said that in spite of the FDA approval, it shouldn’t be used long term. Paula’s Choice doesn’t seem to think it’s an issue and ranks it as Good, since the concentration used in cosmetics and skin care is low. I don’t know what the percentage is here, but I’m going to assume it’s less than 5%. \n\n**PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil** gets a 3 for safety. An emollient ingredient, Paula’s Choice gives it a rating of Good, though there are plenty of sites that are suspicious of it and recommend that is not be used on damaged or injured skin. \n\n**Fragrance** is flagged as being 1-4 in terms of safety, but we have no idea what kind of fragrance is being used here, or what concentration. I can say that the scent is rather light and dissipates quickly, so I don’t see fragrance as being an issue for most people with this product. \n\n**Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate**, a water-based preservative found in a wealth of skin care products and cosmetics, as well as many other products, gets a 4-6 for safety. It earns a Good from Paula’s Choice, and as the concentration used is likely very small, it shouldn’t be a concern for most people. I like my preservatives. \n\nOkay, those are the “flagged” ingredients. After doing my own research on them, I’m not concerned that I’m about to melt off my face or contract cancer from using this product, but I am not a medical or scientific expert. Use this product at your own risk. \n\n*Onto the GOOD ingredients!*\n\nOur star is the **organic cactus extract**, or **Opuntia ficus-indica stem extract** (also known as **prickly pear extract**). I have no idea what the concentration is. According to multiple sources, cactus extract is supposed to be good for moisturizing, protecting, soothing, and firming. It’s also rich in antioxidants and fatty acids. Native Americans allegedly used cactus to treat burns.  (Side note: it’s also edible, and used in a variety of juices, jellies, alcoholic drinks, candies, and teas). Cactus extract contains Vitamin E, which helps soften skin, and Vitamin K, which helps reduce the appearance of dark circles and promote skin elasticity. It’s known for its anti-inflammatory properties, which makes it good for sensitive skin. It’s also high in essential fatty acids. It’s thought to be suitable for all skin types and especially good for mature and sensitive skin. (There are too many articles here to list, but if you search for “prickly pear” or “Opuntia ficus-indica stem extract” or “cactus” and “skin care,” you’ll find a lot of interesting results.) Spoiler alert: using my own face as a test study, this ingredient lives up to all of its hype (except the dark eye circles, which I don’t have, so I don’t know how well it works on those). I could keep raving about this ingredient, but let’s move on so we can get to the actual product. \n\nAnother notable ingredient is **aloe barbadensis leaf polysaccharides**, which is a known anti-irritant and also helps restore suppleness. My sensitive skin loves aloe, so this is another plus for me. \n\nAnother good ingredient is **panthenol**, a humectant that’s an alcohol form of the B vitamin pantothenic acid.\n\nAnd then there’s **dipotassium glycyrrhizate**, which is a fancy way of referring to **licorice root extract**. As many of us licorice root fans know, licorice root is anti-inflammatory and an anti-irritant and has been known to work as a brightening agent and to help reduce the redness and irritation associated with rosacea and acne. I have mild rosacea, so I am thrilled that this ingredient is included. \n\n**Sodium hyaluronate**, a water-soluble salt form of our pal hyaluronic acid, is another winner. It has a smaller molecular size than hyaluronic acid, and thus is able to more easily penetrate the skin, and like HA, it is able to hold up to 1000 times its weight in water. There are many more great things I could say about this product, but most of us are familiar with the benefits of hyaluronic acid. \n\n**Sclerocarya birrea seed oil**, also known as **Marula oil**, is predominantly oleic acid, and it also contains stearic, linoleic, and palmitic acids. It is an antiaging oil that hydrates, protects, and rejuvenates skin. \n\nSo as you can see, this toner is chock full of lots of great ingredients, and in spite of Cosdna’s flagging some of the ingredients for safety (which doesn’t concern me after doing my own research), nothing is flagged as being potentially irritating, and there’s only one potential acne trigger, with a rating of 2 (very low). That said, please remember that YMMV. \n\n*Packaging:*\n\nAqua Toner comes in a sleek 4.05 fl. oz./120 mL airless white pump that I think is made of plastic (at least on the outside). The only negative I would say about the container is that you can’t see how much product you have left, but I suppose the old flashlight trick would work. The product dispenses easily. \n\n*pH:*\n\nI tested the pH, and it comes out to about 5. Perfectly acceptable in my book for a hydrating toner, though probably too high to be a pH-adjusting toner. \n\n*Texture and fragrance:*\n\nThe product is a clear gel with a very faint scent—it’s hard for me to say what it smells like. I want to say “cactus,” but I have no idea what cactus smells like. It strangely reminds me of the scent of Aussie Sprunch Spray in the purple bottle, but much lighter. I don’t find it overpowering or irritating, and it dissipates pretty quickly once the product is absorbed. I was surprised to see that the product is a gel, as it’s my first time to use a gel toner, but the gel quickly melts into the skin.\n\n*How to use:*\n\nThe instructions on the bottle read (in English): “Use morning and evening after cleansing. Take 2-3 pumps to a cotton pad and smooth over face and neck.” (The instructions on the box are in Chinese and say the same thing.) If you use a First Essence, you may wish to use the FTE first if you follow the “thinnest to thickest rule.” At the same time, I have mixed feelings about this, as this product is a great booster for other products, so if you use the Aqua Toner first, your FTE might absorb better. You could play around with it and see what you prefer. Since it’s a gel, I don’t use a cotton pad, which seems like it would waste a lot of precious product—I generally squirt a pump or two onto my hand and apply to one section of my face at a time, patting in with my fingertips, then moving onto the next section. I probably divide my face into three sections (so anywhere from 3-6 pumps of product used at one time), but then I apply the toner around my eye area as well. I’m liberal with it around my eyes because I’ve had such amazing results, as detailed below. I use it both morning at night. The product absorbs pretty quickly, so you don’t have to wait too long to continue your routine. It might even absorb more quickly than other toners I’ve used. \n\n*How I tested this product + my impressions:*\n\nI started testing this toner back in late February/early March, but when my skin broke out in hives due to an unrelated reaction from a hair product getting on my face, I had to reset my routine from zero and put this toner on hold. This meant I wasn’t using any toner for most of March, and in early April I only used Evian mist (pure water) as my toner. When it came time to add a proper toner back into my routine during the last third of April, I reached for the Aqua Toner, since my other sensitive skin toners (Acwell and Klairs) were near-empty, and the ingredients list looked pretty clean. I was quite apprehensive, since I was still haunted by memories of itchy, angry red hives, and I was afraid of a relapse. Fortunately, the Aqua Toner got along well with my skin and caused absolutely no negative reaction (no breakouts, no irritation, nada). \n\nI tested it about a week over my entire face, and I thought my skin seemed suppler, but to test my hunch, for a couple of days after, I only applied the Aqua Toner to the left side of my face, and I applied my almost-empty bottle of Whamisa Organic Flowers Deep Rich Essence Toner to the right side. The difference was palpable after a couple of days: my left side was softer, bouncier, and much more pleasant to touch, and my left cheek was less red and irritated (I have sensitive skin and mild rosacea, and my cheeks gets irritated just by existing). The right side of my face became very jealous from all the attention lavished upon my left, and so I aborted my split-face experiment before a week had elapsed—I wanted that bounciness all over. \n\nThe more I use this product, the more I love it. I’ve probably used it for about 3 ½ weeks, not including my first testing round that was cut short due to hives. I still have a pretty minimalist routine (no ampoules/essences/serums except for my beloved Shark Sauce), but you’d never know it. I even stopped using my First Essence and am just using the Aqua Toner to prep my skin, and I still have The Glow (granted, Shark Sauce is probably also giving me The Glow, so maybe this comment is less about the Aqua Toner and more about the inefficacy of my current FTE). But the best thing is I have that Gym Mat Effect—do you remember the mats you used in gym class when you did gymnastics? That’s how my skin feels: firm yet soft, and bouncy. QQ, as the Taiwanese say. Now, I have a couple of other products that help with the Gym Mat Effect (Shark Sauce, L’Herboflore Flora Supreme Recovery Infusion Crème), but when I feel my face after applying the Aqua Toner and before applying those other products, I still have the coveted Gym Mat Effect. I feel like a narcissist because I can’t stop touching my face. I’m sad that I’m single because someone else needs to be stroking my Gym Mat Face. \n\nAnother perk of this toner is that it helps to minimize the fine lines around my eyes. I’m in my 30s, and thanks to my oily T-zone, my forehead is still smooth, but I have pesky fine lines in the corners and underneath my yes. My eye cream helps a little bit, but this toner makes the lines almost non-existent (almost…you can still see they’re there, but they’re way less visible). The effect also gets better each day; the past couple of mornings, I’ve awakened to a very smooth, almost line-free eye area, and it’s stunning. I can’t help but wonder what amazement would happen if I had a better eye cream to work in conjunction with this toner (I do have the eye cream in the same line, but I’m waiting to use up my lackluster Whamisa eye essence before I start the new product—I hope the Aqua line eye cream won’t disappoint). This is where the toner exceeds my expectations: I expect my toner to hydrate and prep my skin for the additional goodness that’s going to come its way, and if I’m greedy, I might expect my toner to be soothing, and I definitely expect my toner NOT to irritate my skin, but it never occurred to me that I could expect my toner to help diminish the appearance of fine lines. I thought that’s what fancy serums were for. (Let’s be clear: the lines are still there, but my skin is so plumped with hydration that you can’t see them that well—after all, this product doesn’t contain actives like retinol.) \n\nThe longer I use this product, the better results I see. The first couple of days I used it, I thought it was just an ordinary toner in a strange gel form, but now it’s my favorite step of my routine. Not only does the toner itself seem quite effective at soothing, firming, and hydrating, but moreover, I think it’s acting as a booster to make the products that I subsequently apply more effective. I swear my skin gets bouncier and more Gym Mat-esque each day. \n\n*Who might benefit from using this product:*\n\nI believe anyone would benefit, unless you have an allergy or sensitivity to any of the ingredients, in which case, please stay far away. L’Herboflore’s Facebook page implies that it’s suited to all seasons and all skin types (of course they want to sell product, so why not say that?). I think the people who would see the most results are probably people who are in need of some serious hydration (dehydrated and/or dry skin types) and people who are concerned about anti-aging. I have sensitive combination skin, and it doesn’t make my T-zone oily, and my usually dry and sensitive cheeks aren’t dry and are less sensitive. Some of the ingredients are supposed to be helpful for reducing inflammation and acne, so it might also be a useful product to someone who is acne-prone. I’m not sure how someone with oily skin would react to this product, especially during hot and humid weather. As I said, it doesn’t make my T-zone oilier, but I think I’m less oily than many, and I know some people prefer to use a toner that helps to control oil. Moreover, the weather hasn’t been that hot since I’ve starting using the toner. \n\n*How does it stack up to other toners?*\n\nFor comparison, the three hydrating toners I’ve used in the past year are the above-mentioned Whamisa toner, the Klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner (original version before the upgrade), and the Acwell Licorice pH Balancing Cleansing Toner. The Whamisa is too rich for my skin, especially in summer, and as I discussed previously, it doesn’t give my skin that Gym Mat feel that the Aqua Toner does. I find the Klairs toner very soothing, but nowhere near as hydrating as the L’Herboflore. As for the Acwell toner, I like using it to wipe off residue from Vitamin C or other actives, and the L’Herboflore definitely doesn’t have that “cleansing” aspect. The Acwell didn’t soothe my skin as much as the Klairs toner, and it wasn’t as hydrating for me as either of the other two. (I’ll probably repurchase the Acwell however to have on hand for post-actives cleansing.) \n\n*Where to get this product, and how much will it cost you?*\n\nAs I mentioned, I purchased my bottle from the U.S. retailer [Beautibi](https://www.beautibi.com/collections/lherboflore/products/lherboflore-aqua-plus-moisturizing-toner), where it costs US $48. Beautibi does ship internationally. (And to reiterate, I am not shilling for this site. I love the curation, but I gain nothing by you shopping there. In fact, if you do buy the toner there, that’s one less bottle for me to buy.   )  I have not found any other North American retailer that sells this product. \n\nIf you live in Taiwan, China, Malaysia, or Singapore (I believe Singapore has a physical L’Herboflore stand, but maybe it’s only online ordering), you can visit a L’Herboflore stand in person or probably order online (for example, in China, you can order L’Herboflore off of Taobao—I’m not sure if Taobao ships internationally). According to the official L’Herboflore site, the toner retails for NTD $1500, which is about US $45 (so you can see that the Beautibi markup is not that big). I included the Chinese name of the product above in case you want to do an Internet search, which might turn up more possible places where you can purchase it. \n\n*My rating:*\n\n**Five out of five buckets of snail slime and bee spit**, in spite of the fact that Cosdna thinks it might kill me, and in spite of the fact that it’s the priciest toner I’ve ever purchased. I’m apprehensive to give a product such a high rating, since skin care varies so much by person, but this product continues to impress me each day. Maybe I’m having such good results because my hive outbreak left my face dry, flaky, and in such bad shape that things could only get better, but that makes the product even more impressive to me, since when I started using this product the second time around, my skin was still hypersensitive. I’ll definitely repurchase, though I have the “upgraded” Klairs toner in my closet that I’ll need to try first. \n\nI’ll be reviewing three other L’Herboflore skin care products in the coming week (two others from the Aqua line, one from the Flora line), so we’ll see if the rest stack up. So far, I am very excited about the brand and about T-Beauty, and I regret that I didn't buy one of everything that L’Herboflore sells when I had the chance in person. \n\n*Final disclaimer:*\n\nIt concerns me that someone could read this and drop almost $50 on a product that potentially doesn’t work for him/her, so if you choose to purchase this toner, please do so at your own risk. Remember that what gives one person a Gym Mat Face could give another person a dermatological nightmare. \n",

I wanted a shampoo that would cleanse without making my hair dry . So that’s when BA ultra smoothening shampoo came into play & it’s been the only one I have been using since back then . The ultra smoothening hair mask is also my HG if u have ultra rough + fine hair . Probably not the best for thicker hair types . I have seen considerable improvement in my scalp health cz the shampoo would cleanse without stripping moisture . Also , if you sweat a lot or use lot of products & theres buildup on ur scalp , this won’t be enough. You might have to add a clarifying shampoo once in 2 weeks or a month . I have used their smoothening hair serum but unfortunately that didn’t work . Their hair growth serum seemed promising cz it did reduce my hair fall considerably. Their anti-dandruff range is bad , my brother used it & got more dandruff instead .",

I used this in the AM. Doesn’t react with tret creams. Loved using this although fragrance can be a downside.\n\n>WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ahaglow S Foaming Facewash** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 2 months {*currently using in the AM*}\n\nActive Ingredients: Salicylic Acid, Glycolic Acid\n\nBrief review: Bought this because i was tired of purchasing 50ml small bottles of foaming facewash since this was available in a 100ml pack. The ingredients are ok. Not as good as oraface. The pump is wasteful and more product is wasted than used. Didn’t cause breakouts. Decent face wash.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cetaphil oily skin facewash** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 2 years + {*currently using in the PM*}\n\nBrief review: Absolutely in love with this product. Holygrail face wash, can always rely on this face wash. I first started using this when I first started breaking out and this delivered well. I still use it in the PM only to avoid actives overload.\n\n>WRP. Holy grail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Toners*\n\n**Simple kind to skin toner** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 4 months {*not using currently*}\n\nActive Ingredients: Niacinamide, witch hazel\n\nBrief review: Decent, beginner friendly toner. I loved using it and so did my friends after purchasing it on my recommendation. The witch hazel was the right amount so it did not strip off my skin. It also had some moisturising ingredients because my face did feel supple after use. Although since the production has begun in India and someone said the quality of the moisturiser has deteriorated so did not repurchase.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Minimalist PHA Toner** {*bought on a friends recommendation*}\n\nUsage: 4 weeks {*not using currently*}\n\nActive Ingredients: Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Inulin, Lactococcus Ferment Lysate, Saccharide Isomerate, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Salicylic Acid, Allantoin, Glycerin, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Lysine, Histidine, Arginine, Aspartic Acid, Threonine, Serine, Glutamic Acid, Proline, Glycine, Alanine, Valine, Methionine, Isoleucine, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate. \n\nBrief review: I did not like this toner and I was very hopeful for this toner because it had good reviews, great ingredients and budget price point.. For me the one major requirement in a toner it for it to be of a water consistency, and this has a slightly thick syrupy consistency which just did not suit my skin. I kept getting small bumps and breakouts all over my face and this did not soothe my skin or make is feel supple. This also did not layer well with my actives and instead just made my face feel heavy after using it.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**One Thing H. Cordata Extract** {*self bought - youtuber influenced purchase*}\n\nUsage: 9 weeks {*currently using in the AM/PM*}\n\nIngredients:  Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexaniediol\n\nBrief review: Absolutely in love with this product for its affect on my skin as well as how multifunctional it is. It does what it says and soothes my skin, reduces redness and helps with any irritation caused due to makeup or acne. The only con is the price point is not at all budget friendly. Although I have been using it for the last 9 weeks and have only finished a little more than half the bottle. Although, once I finish this I might try a different one from the ONE THING range.\n\n>WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Serums*\n\n{*Since I was seeing a dermatologist for my acne and acne scars I used a couple of actives that were doctor recommended and since all of those were rx products I would not be reviewing those*}\n\n**Minimalist 2% Alpha Arbutin + 1% HA** {*bought on reddit recomendation*}\n\nUsage: 7 weeks {*currently in use*}\n\nIngredients:  Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin \n\nBrief review: Love it. Since I stopped using all rx products I wanted a serum for my PIH and PIE and reddit had some really good recommendation for this active. So I gave in and bought this and I lve lve love it, in 7 weeks i can see my old pih scars faded and any new red acne I have has a fast healing time after using AA. So definitely have a raving review for this product. I use 2 drops on moist skin (from toner) and it evenly layers out.\n\n>WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Suganda 5% Niacinamide** {*bought after i received a sample*}\n\nUsage: 8 weeks {*currently in use*}\n\nIngredients:  Aqua, Niacinamide (5%), Propylene Glycol, Panthenol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf (Green Tea) Extract, Sodium hyaluronate crosspolymer, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin \n\nBrief review: Again, very glad that my skin loved this product. It helps boost the effect f my minimalist AA serum. Helps in controlling the oiliness of my very oily skin in summers, and the two ingredients centella asiatica and green tea extract helps spreading 2 drops well on my full face and avoid over usage of products. So, I will 100% keep using this for life because I love it.\n\n>Holy Grail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Formularx Lactic Acid Serum** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 4 weeks {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients:  Water, lactic acid, caprylic/capric triglyceride, gluconolactone, glycerin, cetearyl alcohol, sodium hydroxide, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, phenoxyethanol, agastache mexicana flower/leaf/stem extract, disodium edta, xanthan gum, ethylhexylglycerin. \n\nBrief review: So I used this product twice in a week (in the PM) and this has a cream like consistency and my skin just hated it. I could see red ness and irritation on my skin as soon as I applied it. I even made sure not to use it with any actives but it still did not d anything for my skin and just irritated it. So, it is just lying on my self with no use and my heart hurts because this was so expensive and had god reviews on ig. So this this brand really isn't reliable. I love the moisturiser but this formula just did not work even when my skin is used to strong actives.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Moisturiser*\n\n**Acrofy Acne Lotion** {*derm recommended*}\n\nUsage: 1 year + {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients: -/-\n\nBrief review: Good/basic moisturiser for acne prone skin, helped me when I had the worst breakouts of my life. It is creamy consistency and does feel a little heavy and doesn't really mattify the skin. Stopped using it because my dermatologist recommended a different one.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ahaglow Acne Moisturising Gel** {*derm recommended*}\n\nUsage: 2 months {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients: -/-\n\nBrief review: This is an ok moisturiser, I don't like fragrance in my moisturiser so I did not really like this but it did not cause any breakouts but did make my face moisturised. So if you hate fragrance, steer clear of this product.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sebamed Clear Gel** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 3 months {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients: Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Panthenol\n\nBrief review: Loved the moisturiser especially in Delhi summers. Helped skin feel supple and moisturiser, can call this a substitute for HA serum.\n\n>WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Minimalist Sepicalm Oat Moisturiser** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 2 weeks {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients:  Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Squalane, Glycerine, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Sodium Cocoyl Aminoacids, Sarcosine, Potassium Aspartate, Magnesium Aspartate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Avena Sativa (Oat Kernel) Flour, Sodium Polyglutamate, Undecane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Tocopherol Acetate, Arginine, Glycine, Alanine, Histidine, Sodium Lactate, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Tridecane, Aluminium Starch Octenylsuccinate, Trehalose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate \n\nBrief review: My skin hated this, it cause cc all over my skin and was very thick in consistency. I bought this as the the ingredient list matched the one of formularx barrier relief and this was a budget one so went for this. I tried using a normal amount and it was horrible, I also tried using a very small amount since it is thick and even then it just made my skin sweat and break out. So I stopped using and thought that this might help during winters but again just made my skin suffocate. It is probably a good moisturiser but not for my skin type at all. So now just to finish off the product i use it on my hands or as an eye cream.\n\n>WNRP. Holy Fail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Formularx Barrier Relief Moisturizer** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 10 weeks {*currently in use*}\n\nIngredients: Water, caprylic/ capric triglyceride, glycerin, niacinamide, propanediol, cetearyl alcohol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, sodium hyaluronate, colloidal oatmeal, panthenol, allantoin, ceramide np, ceramide ap, ceramide eop, phytosphingosine, cholesterol, linoleic acid, sodium lauroyl lactylate, xanthan gum, butylene glycol, carbomer, tocopherol, phenoxyethanol, dimethicone, disodium edta, linolenic acid, ethylhexylglycerin. \n\nBrief review: I love this, my skin loves this and I really hate that I love it because it is a very problematic brand. But, nevertheless, the product deserves the love, it is lightweight and still moisturises my skin well. In winters I get weird dry patches on my skin and it peels off. This moisturiser prevented it. It layers well with my actives and makeup and it overall soothing and does the work it claims. I am almost one with my first tube and even though it is expensive, it lasts a good time for me so can call it worth the money. I also love how it is in an aluminium tube instead of a plastic one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Sunscreen*\n\n**UV Doux Sunscreen gel**\n\nUsage: currently in use {*only use when I step outside*}\n\nBrief review: I love this, bought this on recommendations from this channel and the texture is oh so lovely. The only con is the smell as it smells like baby powder x old deo lol but still a good purchase.\n\n>WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Miscellaneous*\n\n**Sheet Mask - The Face Shop**\n\nReally loving these face masks these days incase anyone wanted a review, hehe.",

    "body": "I'm From wash off masks are well-loved in the Asian Beauty community. So I've been trying a few of these out and wanted to let you all know my experiences with them! The Fig Scrub Mask is a new product I received as a beauty tester for Wishtrend. Would have preferred getting the essence or cleansing balm instead, but hey! A free product's a free product.\n\n**I'm From Honey Mask**\n\n*Ingredients:*\n\n>Honey, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Pentylene Glycol, Microcrystalline Wax, Polysorbate 20, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Beeswax, Tocopheryl Acetate, Argania Spinosa Kernel Extract, Corylus Avellana (Hazel) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Water, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Propolis Extract, Beta-Glucan, Bee Venom, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Sophora Angustifolia Root Extract, Eugenia Caryophyllus (Clove) Flower Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Punica Granatum Fruit Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin\n\n*Overview:*\n\n- Looks and feels like a thick, gooey caramel sauce. Smells sweet since there's a lot of honey in this, but it's notably a medicinal type of honey scent. If you've ever smelled manuka honey this scent is within that general ballpark.\n- May separate occasionally. All you have to do is stir and it's good to go.\n- Pretty much never dries down. They recommend leaving it on for 10-60 minutes. Dry people would probably benefit more from leaving it on longer, but 60 minutes is overkill. I just do 30 minutes.\n- My first time washing this off, I had removed most of it with a wet paper towel (to save my clog prone sink) but thought it was strange that everything hadn't been taken off yet no matter how much I rinsed. Then I realized - no, that wasn't the mask. Or any residue. That plump, bouncy thing I was touching was just MY FACE. This mask just seems to max out your moisture levels like mad.\n- I think most people would really enjoy the Honey Mask. Dry and dehydrated skin types would especially love it. People who are oily and already have enough moisture may find it doesn't do much for them, though.\n\n**I'm From Mugwort Mask**\n\n*Ingredients:*\n\n>Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cordyceps Sinensis Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Methylpropanediol, Ligularia Fishceri Leaf Extract, Rosa Davurica Bud Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Sodium Polyacrylaste, Carbomer, Arginine, Phenoxyethanol, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Panthenol, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA\n\n*Overview:*\n\n- A clearish brown gel with bits of real mugwort. This is not supposed to be an exfoliating mask so be careful and don't rub those pieces in too much.\n- Kinda looks like you've rubbed dirt all over your face. Not necessarily a bad thing.\n- There's a distinctive scent. I've never specifically encountered mugwort before delving into K-beauty, but opening this immediately reminded me of the smell from Chinese traditional herbal stores. This smell isn't overwhelmingly strong but it is present. People who dislike those kinds of earthy scents will probably hate this.\n- Actually dries down. About 10-15 minutes depending on how thin of a layer you put on.\n- In contrast to the honey mask which excels at nourishing and plumping out your skin, the mugwort masks excels at reducing redness and calming irritation. It also made my face look a bit brighter.\n- It's not a moisture bomb like the honey mask. But it's enough to keep my skin decently hydrated and in a pretty good state.\n- This mask is pretty lightweight. Pretty much anyone can use this. Rather than a question of \"do you want a product for your skin type\", it's more of a question of \"do you have irritated skin and want a product targeted towards calming it down?\" The Mugwort Mask definitely delivers in this regard.\n\n**I'm From Fig Scrub Mask**\n\n*Ingredients:*\n\n>Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sucrose, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate , Stearalkonium Hectorite, C13-15 Alkane, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Powder, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Seed Meal, Fragrance(Parfum), Juglans Regia (Walnut) Shell Powder, Caprylyl Glycol, Caramel\n\n*Overview:*\n\n- Since this is a new product many people haven't seen yet, [here's some pictures!](https://imgur.com/a/Yh4QBfs)\n- Disclaimer: I'm not someone who usually uses scrubs on my face. So I can't really compare it to other products of this type.\n- The Honey Mask is gooey. The Mugwort Mask is a gel. I would the describe the Fig Scrub Mask as chunky.\n- This is an exfoliating wash off mask primarily made of sugar and fig powder. It has tiny 1mm wide nut pieces which are either the sweet almond or walnut shell listed in the ingredients. \n- There's a light fruit scent. Presumably this is what fig smells like, but can't confirm as I've never actually eaten fig. As Kelly Driscoll mentioned with the Ginseng line - if an I'm From product has a fragrant component it might just be included to amplify whatever scent's already in there. It doesn't seem to be an artificial fruit scent. Still find it unnecessary and would have preferred this product to have no fragrance at all. It's an exfoliating mask so what's the point?\n- The instructions say to leave it on for 10-15 minutes and then gently rub for a few more minutes. It doesn't say whether you're supposed to put it on wet or dry skin. I assume the wait time is for softening dead skin cells, so dry skin is probably the way to go.\n- As with all physical exfoliants - the end result will mainly depend on the user. Contrary to the name, you shouldn't actually scrub your face with this like you would scrub burnt bits off a pan. Please be gentle when massaging this in.\n- Could feel the mask warming up with the heat of my face and becoming a little more pliable. Not all the sugar's going to dissolve. Don't wait for that to be an indication of when you should stop rubbing. Just lightly glide with circular motions a couple times and wash it off.\n- My first time using this, there were flakes around my mouth (maybe from not massaging there enough) and a puffy red patch on my cheek (maybe from massaging there a little too much). So it's important to be thorough, but it's even more important to be gentle.\n- This leaves a similar moisturized feeling to the Honey Mask but to a lesser degree. My face feels smooth after.\n\n**Some further comments:**\n\n- The Honey and Mugwort Masks are available in sample size tubes. So try those out before buying the full size. Good for 5-6 uses.\n- Nobody else mentioned this, but all I'm From wash off masks come with a handy spatula.\n- The Fig Scrub Mask primarily uses capric triglyceride. This is also included in the Honey Mask, but with 60% confirmed honey and a lot of other ingredients it should be much lower than 40%. Capric triglyceride is a coconut oil derivative. It's included in a lot of other well-known skincare products and definitely not as bad as straight up raw coconut oil. But if you have a sensitivity or are clog-prone to coconut-derived ingredients, I'd say avoid the Fig/Honey Masks.\n- The Honey Mask is an easy universal recommendation to most people. But all these masks are meant to target different things. Anyone wondering which one to get should primarily choose one for their own skin concerns.\n\ntldr; honey for moisture/mugwort for soothing/fig for physical exfoliating\n\nThank you for reading this word vomit! By the way, if anyone has any tips for wearing glasses on top of wash-off masks, I'd love to know.",

    "body": "*Moisturisers seem to be the most boring and ignored category in a skincare regime but I have learnt over the years that they actually play the most important role. Sometimes actives are not what your skin is looking for and a good moisturiser can be the game-changer.*\n\n[Just a pic](https://preview.redd.it/p39fzjc4kx661.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=027cc219d95e8947525507a3beec33a9d459f961)\n\nBefore I review the products, these are my expectations from my moisturiser.\n\n1. ***Hydrate:*** Bring water/moisture to my skin\n2. ***Emolliate:*** Thanks to kindofstephen (google his blog or insta if you haven't) for providing a term to my feelings. Make my skin soft and supple by nourishing my stratum corneum with nourishing lipids without clogging my pores.\n3. ***Strengthen my barrier:*** To reduce TEWL by strengthening my barrier so that my skin stays hydrated and supple for longer. This also means I want the moisturiser to have slight occlusive properties.\n4. ***Repair:*** To help my damaged/sensitised skin by repairing my skin barrier.\n5. ***Extras/added benefits:*** Would like if the moisturiser additionally helps to deliver certain ingredients that help with targetted issues like ageing, hyperpigmentation etc. This is not a must though.\n\n\\---\n\n***1. Avene Skin Recover Cream -*** ₹*1500 (depends on discounts); Cost Per gm: ₹30/gm*\n\nThis is my go-to skin-emergency product. I do not use it on daily basis. The texture is cloudlike but not mousse-y. It is a lightweight cream. Nevertheless, it packs a punch. I have gone through 8+ tubes of this stuff. It is the only cream that does not aggravate any sensitised areas (burning/redness/dry patches/peeling patches) and absolutely calms my skin. This cream is true to its name. Repairs compromised flaking, sensitised skin in two days with twice/thrice a day usage. The ingredient list is very minimalistic. It is expensive and the sterile patented packaging kind of sucks because you will most definitely have face squirts if you are not careful. However, I can rely on this cream to fix my skin mistakes.\n\n* Hydrate: 4/5\n* Emmoliate: 4/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 4.5/5\n* Extras: 0/5\n* Status: HG, It is easily available in India but shit is expensive.\n\n***Perfect for: All skin types, Sensitive skin***\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene Aqua), Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Squalane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Serine, Carbomer, Tetrasodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, Water (Aqua)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***2. Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream -*** *$10/* ₹*1300 (with shipping/customs); Cost per gm* ₹6.5/gm\n\nI tried this product a month back and I am in love. This cream is perfectly balanced. It adequately hydrates and emolliates my skin. My skin feels supple and bouncy without being too greasy and the moisture lasts. I did not see noticeable calming benefits but as a moisturiser it is lovely. The tube is huge and a little goes a long way. This has a slight cooling effect when applied to the skin. Also uses a patented encapsulation delivery mechanism to delivery pseudo-ceramides (lab-made) which help to strengthen your skin barrier. In short, it is a simple no frill moisturiser that is easy to use - not too thick, not too thin, not too heavy, not too light, doesn't sensitize, not too silicone-y, doesn't pill, value for money.\n\n* Hydrate: 4/5\n* Emmoliate: 4/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 3.5/5\n* Extras: 0/5\n* Status: will repurchase.\n\n***Perfect for: All skin types***\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Stearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Palmitic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide Mea, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Magnolia Biondii Flower Extract, Cholesterol, Perilla Ocymoides Seed Extract, Lactobacillus/​Soybean Ferment Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohols, Glyceryl Caprylate, Dimethiconol, Mannitol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Silica, Arachidyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Alcohol, Acrylates/​Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polysorbate 20, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Propanediol*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***3. Eucerin Q10 Anti Wrinkle Face Cream -*** *$9*\n\nThis is my third tub of this cream. This cream is richer than any cream in the lot. It has a thick emollient texture without being too greasy. It absorbs easily in the skin. It also contains shea butter, SAP and Ubiquinone (Q10). This cream has helped me transition into tretinoin. Do not recommend it for day time use (especially in summers) but for night time/winters it is perfect. It keeps my face moisturised through the night and it has a soft blurring effect on fine lines/skin texture. It did not sensitize peeling skin but helped repair my barrier. I use this regularly at night and it helped to fix the acute dryness that comes with tretinoin. I use it around my eyes and it hasn't given me milia/ clogged my pores. My mom loves and swears by it. She finds it makes her wrinkles look softer.\n\n* Hydrate: 3.5/5\n* Emmoliate: 4.5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 4/5\n* Extras: 3/5\n* Status: HG but not readily available in India. Will stock up when relatives come post covid.\n\n***Perfect for:*** *Combo-dehydrated/Dry/ Mature skin*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Cocoate, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Stearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Octyldodecanol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ubiquinone, Biotin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Zea Mays (Corn) Oil, Beta-Carotene, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Trisodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Phenoxyethanol*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***4. Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume -*** ₹*1300 (with shipping/customs); Cost per gm* ₹6.5/gm\n\nThis cream is unique. As the name suggests it is a cream-balm hybrid but the texture is surprisingly lightweight. Highly emollient with occlusive properties. It absorbs quickly into the skin as the texture is not too heavy. Sadly, it leaves a greasy feeling/film on my skin. I can not use it the day time and worry that it will clog my pores if I use it on my face. I love it for the body especially my Sahara hands. It seriously brings life to my hands and I do not need to reapply often. I did notice a calming effect. Many of my friends from the community love to use it on their face. It is a little too heavy for my face. If your face is very dry, I think you may like this.\n\n* Hydrate: 3/5\n* Emmoliate: 5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 3.5/5\n* Extras: 0\n* Status: WNRP at least for my face.\n\n***Perfect for:***  *Extremely Dry Skin*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Aqua/​Water/​Eau, Glycerin, Paraffinum Liquidum /​ Mineral Oil /​ Huile Minerale, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Behenyl Alcohol, Sucrose Stearate, Canola /​ Canola Oil /​ Huile De Colza, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Pentylene Glycol, Beta-Sitosterol, Xylitol, Zinc Gluconate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Palmitamide Mea, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Rhamnose, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 60, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Phytosphingosine, Ceramide Np, Mannitol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide Ap, Cholesterol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Ceramide EOP*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***5. Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream -*** ₹2700 *(estimated); Cost per gm* ₹45/gm\n\nI was sort of disappointed with this product. It is not a bad product but it is not necessarily better. The soft blue colour deceives your mind to think the cream texture may be light. It is actually slightly thick with a silicone-y feel. It has a cooling effect on the skin when you first apply it which tricks the calming feeling. While it is hydrating when you first apply it but compared to others I feel the moisture does not last as long. Also, it makes the sensitised area skin sort of burn. The feeling is not intense but very much against claims. I did not notice any calming/repairing benefits. It may also not be enough moisturisation for the winters. The colour is aesthetically pleasing and silicone-y texture + cooling feel can outwit you into enjoying application but I do not see many real benefits.\n\n* Hydrate: 3/5\n* Emmoliate: 2.5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 3/5\n* Repair: 3/5\n* Extras: 1?\n* Status: WNRP, Expensive.\n\n***Perfect for:***  *Oily/ Combo Dehydrated Skin?*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Centella Asiatica Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Glyceryl Stearate, Stearic Acid, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Polysorbate 60, Bees Wax, Chlorphenesin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Morus Alba Root Extract, Tromethamine, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Guaiazulene, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Lecithin, Acetyl Glutamine, SH-Oligopeptide-1, SH-Oligopeptide-2, SH-Polypeptide-1, SH-Polypeptide-9, SH-Polypeptide-11, Bacillus/​Soybean/​Folic Acid Ferment Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol*\n\n&#x200B;",

    "body": "Hi all!  \n\n\nI am back with another skin conditions post. This one is on perioral dermatitis.   \n\n\nAdmittedly, when I began researching this, I knew zilch about PD except that it was acne-like breakouts around the mouth,  and as I began to research it, it seems that there isn't a whole lot that is known about it. Fortunately, it is a highly treatable condition that seems to overlap to a degree with rosacea (earning it the earlier name  of \"steroid rosacea\") and even seborrheic dermatitis.  \n\n\n**As always, please feel free to correct or inform me of anything wrong, and also feel free to post/discuss what helps your PD.**\n\n# What is Perioral Dermatitis\n\nPerioral dermatitis (PD) is a chronic, recurrant inflammatory disease that most commonly occurs in the perioral region of the face (the area around the mouth). It can also affect the area around the nose, and in roughly 20&#37; of cases, it can manifest around the eyes (though it goes by another name if around the eyes: peri-orificial dermatitis).   \n\n\nIt afflicts around 1&#37; of the population of the United States, particularly those with fair skin, and predominately occurs in women between 18-45, with 20s and 30s having peak incidence.   \n\n\nIt presents as small, red, tender, sometimes itchy bumps that can flake and burn. While commonly mistaken for acne, it is distinct from acne in that it only presents in specific locations, spares the small area around the lips, and lacks pustules (whiteheads).\n\n# Causes of Perioral Dermatitis\n\nThe causes of perioral dermatitis are unclear. It is a relatively \"young\" disease that was only first described as a distinct condition in 1964. It is first and foremost an inflammatory condition, and is aggravated by ingredients and habits that can create inflammation either in the skin or in the body. \n\nWhile I was researching PD, the one constant that showed up again and again is that it is aggravated by corticosteroid use -- both topical and inhaled. To specify, that means not just creams like kenalog, triamcinolone, and over-the-counter hydrocortisone, but also asthma inhalers (including Advair, Flovent, and ProAir aka Albuterol) and nasal allergy mists like Beconase, Flonase, Nasonex, Omnaris, and Veramyst. \n\nLess commonly, but still a factor to consider are hormones, where monthly shifts can put the condition into overdrive. More frustrating is that oral contraceptives can worsen PD in some. \n\nOther causes can be fluoridated toothpaste, high SPF value sunscreens¹, sunscreens with the filters zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, the ingredient \"isopropyl myristate,\" improperly removing makeup or sleeping in makeup, occlusive ointments (Vaseline, Aquaphor, and oils, for example), heavy creams with occlusive ingredients, and cold creams (wipe-off cleansing creams that leave a residue, like Pond's). In one case, a woman's favorite lip balm (containing the ingredient propyl gallate) caused her PD.⁶\n\n# Treatment\n\nPD can look like many other conditions, such as acne, angular cheilitis, rosacea, or seborrheic dermatitis, and requires treatment of a professional due to the inflammatory nature of the condition. \n\nThe most important thing for anyone suffering from PD is to discontinue steroid use - whether cold-turkey or weened off with the management of a healthcare professional. While topical steroids can seem to improve the condition, they frequently create a rebound effect, which can make the condition worse. \n\nOnce steroids are removed, the skin will get worse before getting better. This is the toughest part of PD for most people. Topical antibiotics or topical immunosuppresants (such as Pimecrolimus or Elidel) are frequently prescribed due to their tremendously  helpful anti-inflammatory effects on PD, and azelaic acid can prove useful in some cases. In very severe cases, oral antibiotics can be prescribed in addition to topicals. \n\nWhile healing from PD, the skin should not be cleansed with any cleanser, and makeup and skincare products should be avoided completely until the condition resolves. And no matter how tempting, PD should never be scrubbed, as this worsens the inflammation. \n\nOnce treated, it is encouraged to use liquid or gel sunscreens as well as soap-free cleansers that do not dry out the skin, as TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss) is significant in people who suffer from PD.\n\n# Long-Term Care\n\nSome people have PD once in their lives, while others may combat it on and off for several years. If you fall into the latter, it is important to try to avoid triggers that can cause the condition to reoccur (particularly steroid use). That means cleansing your skin each day with gentle cleansers, always removing makeup (removing it with a wipe does *NOT* count - you need to cleanse it away thoroughly with an oil cleanser that rinses cleanly), and using light products, particularly around the areas typically affected. \n\nPrescriptions like azelaic acid and over-the-counter .1&#37; adapalene (Differin)² may  also help to manage the condition in the long-term. \n\nI've put together a list below of some cleansers and moisturizers that are recommended for people suffering from PD. Again, like with my rosacea list, this is not a be-all-end-all list. None of the products listed contain isopropyl myristate or heavy occlusive ingredients.\n\n## Recommended Products\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser** \n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Stearyl Alcohol and Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate​,​ Polysorbate 60​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Panthenol​,​ T-Butyl Alcohol,​ Tocopherol​.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Wate/Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryl Glycol/Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**Avene Extremely Gentle Cleanser Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (avene Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Serine, Cetrimonium Bromide, Coco-Glucoside, Dipotassium Phosphate, Disodium Edta, Disodium Phosphate, O-Phenylphenol, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Water (Aqua).*\n\n**Spectro Jel Cleanser for Blemish-Prone Skin - Fragrance Free**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Hydroxypropyl Methocellulose, Polysorbate 20, Cetyl Alcohol (moisturizer), Hydrated Silica, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Diazolidinyl Urea, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Sorbitan Oleate.*\n\n## Foaming Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Terastearate, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric, Glycerides, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Sodium Chloride, Phytosphingosine, Citric Acid, Edetate Disodium, Dihydrate, Sodium, Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Olay Foaming Face Wash Sensitive**\n\n>*Ingredients: Water/Eau, Glycerin, Sodium Myristoyl Sarcosinate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Polyquaternium-10, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Laureth-10, Disodium Lauroamphodiacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, DMDM Hydantoin.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate​,​ PEG-120 Methyl Glucoside Dioleate,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Hydroxide​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Capryloyl Glycine​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Citric Acid​,​ Acrylates Copolymer​.*\n\n## Makeup Removers\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm**\n\n>*Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Polyethylene, PEG-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Water / Aqua / Eau, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol.*\n\n**Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Mineral Oil, PEG-8 Glyceryl Isostearate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclomethicone, Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Isostearic Acid, Glycerin, Phenoexyethanol.*\n\n## Moisturizers\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Ceteareth-20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Phosphate, Potassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben.*\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3-Diisosterate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide 1, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium phosphate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 20, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Active - Dimethicone, 1\\%.

        "body": "I’ve been diagnosed with Peri-orbital Dermatitis by my dermatologist. I’ve had it for at least 10 years. Peri-orbital means it presents around my eyes, nose and mouth. My worst flare ups cover all three areas, my most frequent flare ups present just around my nostrils. \n\nYes, you’re correct that causes are basically unknown. Successful treatments can vary wildly. \n\n(personally, I’m convinced it has a fungal element, specially related to candida imbalance. That’s just my opinion. I have used OTC topicalS and been prescribed anti-fungal topicals and pills, none of that worked. I believe it is related to gut microbiome health. Our skin is a direct reflection of what’s going on intrinsically in our bodies) \n\nI want chime in here about Zinc Oxide. You mention it as a possible cause. I want others out here to know that high concentration Zinc Oxide Cream is the ONLY thing that stops my flare ups. So if you have PD, I recommend patch testing a high ZO cream on one or two of the papules and see if it helps you. Incidentally, I’ve found recently that micronized ZO particles actually work faster for my than larger particles. So I stopped using Desitin Max strength and started using Neutrogena Sheer Zinc for face with 22% ZO. It stops my flare ups completely in a matter of a day or so, versus 4+ days with the Desitin. \n\nI’ll list below everything I’ve tried in case it’s helpful. The other product I find helpful is daily probiotic pills containing Lactobacillus Acidophilus. I get less flare ups when I take daily probiotics. \n\nDIDN’T WORK: \nAntibacterial Rx creams, I believe I had both Erythromycin and Dapsone. OTC antifungal creams, clotrimazole, miconazole and terbinafine. I also had an oral Rx for Lamisil, it was generic and I can’t recall the generic name. OTC topical steroids, hydrocortisone. Violet extract. Cutting out SLS from from my toothpaste and hair products. (I never cleansed with SLS, always either soap or oil) Changing my diet to an acne safe diet. Getting sun. Staying out of sun. Sulphur washes. Leaving it alone.",

I had no idea what perioral dermatitis was and assumed all this redness was broken capillaries from a Clarisonic. \n\nIt wasn’t until I went to a dermatologist and asked her about it that she said it looked like perioral dermatitis. I was prescribed Finacea and in one month the results have been astounding. Redness has significantly reduced and no closed comedones or inflamed pimples anywhere. Again mine wasn’t severe but for anyone who has it I think azelaic acid is a great choice. \n\nI should point out I never use steroids, I’m 30F and I think this was due to over moisturizing after over exfoliating. I also think the occlusive nature of aquaphor made it much worse. My routine now consists of nothing but cleanser, moisturizer and Finacea. Drastic change from what I was doing before. \n\nThank you for taking the time to post this very informative breakdown of perioral dermatitis.",

There’s nothing wrong with the ingredients, its just the formulation and ingredients for the moisturizer isn’t worth more than $5, it has no high levels of any active ingredients/patented technology (almost all moisturizers at that price point has patents). If this were ingredients for a dollar store hand cream, then i would buy it, unfortunately it’s $134.  Avant products AREN’T EVEN WORTH the $12 Boxycharm add on/pop up price.\n\nLook at the ingredients for Acure Radically Rejuvenating Whipped Night Cream ($15.99 on iherb.com) \n\nWATER/AQUA/EAU, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CETEARYL OLIVATE, SORBITAN OLIVATE, SCLEROCARYA BIRREA (MARULA) SEED OIL, NYMPHAEA ALBA ROOT EXTRACT, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-1, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-2, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-1, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-9, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-11, COPPER PALMITOYL HEPTAPEPTIDE-14, HEPTAPEPTIDE-15 PALMITATE, PALMITOYL TETRAPEPTIDE-7, PALMITOYL TRIPEPTIDE-1 (PEPTIDE BLEND), FERULIC ACID, ASCORBIC GLUCOSIDE (VITAMIN C), COCONUT ALKANES, PSEUDOALTEROMONAS FERMENT EXTRACT (GLACIAL GLYCOPROTEINS), SALICYLIC ACID COCO-CAPRYLATE/CAPRATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ASPARTIC ACID, LINOLEIC ACID, LINOLENIC ACID, LECITHIN, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, LACTIC ACID/GLYCOLIC ACID COPOLYMER, CURCUMA LONGA (TURMERIC) ROOT EXTRACT, SYMPHYTUM OFFICINALE CALLUS CULTURE EXTRACT.\n\nBesides the fact that this has way more antioxidants/age prevention/hydrating ingredients.  This ingredients list for a $16 moisturizer might look familiar to some people because it’s like 95% the same as a certain Drunk Elephant Moisturizer(it’s just missing a few amino acids at the end of the ingredients list but all the important ingredients are exactly the same, even the peptides are the same).  Looks a thousand times better than all the crappy $130 Avant Moisturizers, and this is just one example, there’s CeraVe, Elf, tons of Korean brand moisturizers, all around or under $20. \n\nDECIEM’s hand cream $16 for 100ML\nAqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propanediol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Copper Lysinate/Prolinate, Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Methylglucoside Phosphate, Proline, Alanine, Serine, Pseudoalteromonas Ferment Extract, Tremella Fuciformis Sporocarp Extract, Tocopherol, Betaine, Cellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Sodium Phosphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Parfum (Fragrance), Limonene, Linalool.\n\nThere’s copper peptide (the next big thing in anti aging), snow mushrooms, amino acids, algae ferment, and Plantago Lanceolata which can reduce dark spots, all this from a hand cream, people were using this as a facial moisturizer cos it’s that good. \n\nMoisturizers which are around $134\n\n- Guerlain’s Abeille Royale Creams (has patent on formulas and also the frigging jar the moisturizer comes in) \n\n* Sisley Black Rose Cream Mask (really this needs no introduction) \n\n* Charlotte Tilbury’s Night Cream\n\n* Dior Capture Totale Firming and Wrinkle Correcting Cream (Again patented formula, with a lot of research and clinical trials)\n\n* Lancer Skincare the Nourish (Dr. Lancer dermatologists for Hollywood Stars) \n\n* Fresh Creme Ancienne Moisturizer (Literally made by hand in a Monastery in Europe) \n\n* Chanel Le Lift Restorative Cream (clinical and in vitro testing, patented formula) \n\n* Caudalie Premium Cru Rich/Normal Cream (again patented formula, developed with Harvard Medical School) \n\n* If you check out CultBeauty the Eve Lom holiday set (the one with the Moisture Cream and cleanser (all full size) are basically the same RV as the stupid Avant moisturizer. \n\nThe list can go on forever, also Anti pollution micellar water from Chanel only costs $45. If you take a look at the ingredients for Avant’s Micellar Water it’s missing a very crucial ingredient that the majority of “high end/effective” micellar water contain, PEG-6 Caprylic/ Capric Glycerides.  Seriously this is not even worth $1. \nLastly someone from this subreddit did some research on this company, I think she concluded it was being used to launder money. But the fact that they’re selling you crap for $100+ is enough proof for me.\n\nNow the 111skin products we get from boxycharm or Ipsy are NOT the same as the ones sold in retail stores or 111skin’s online site.  The hydra gel moisturizer that came from Ipsy for example has a completely different ingredients list from the “real” moisturizer.\n\nIngredients from 111skin Cryo Activating Hydra Gel Ipsy version: \nAloe Barbadensis Gel, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Butylene Glycol, Isohexadecane, Dipropylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond / Amande Douce) Oil, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Betaine, Lecithin, Pyrus Malus (Apple / Pomme) Fruit Water, Allantoin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Hydroxyacetophenone, Trehalose, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Aluminium Dicetyl Phosphate, BHT, Tetrasodium EDTA, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow / Achillée) Extract, Xanthan Gum, Menthol, Menthyl Lactate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Fragrance / Parfum, Limonene, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Linalool.\n\nIngredients from 111skin’s site for the Hydra Gel:\nAQUA / WATER / EAU, NELUMBO NUCIFERA (LOTUS) ROOT WATER, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, GLYCERIN, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND / AMANDE DOUCE) OIL, SODIUM ACRYLATES COPOLYMER, CARBOMER, TETRAHEXYLDECYL ASCORBATE, ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, BETAINE, LECITHIN, PROPANEDIOL, BENZYL ALCOHOL, HORDEUM VULGARE (BARLEY / ORGE) SEED EXTRACT, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PRUNUS PERSICA (PEACH / PÊCHE) JUICE, PYRUS MALUS (APPLE / POMME) JUICE, TRITICUM VULGARE (WHEAT / BLÉ) SEED EXTRACT, DISODIUM EDTA, PANAX GINSENG ROOT EXTRACT, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, TRIHYDROXYSTEARIN, ACHILLEA MILLEFOLIUM (YARROW / ACHILÉE) EXTRACT, SODIUM HYALURONATE, MENTHOL, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, ALOE VERA LEAF EXTRACT, GLYCERYL UNDECYLENATE, MENTHYL LACTATE, XANTHAN GUM, GLUCOMANNAN, FRAGRANCE / PARFUM, BENZYL SALICYLATE, LIMONENE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL.\n\nSee the difference? The Ipsy one although it advertises that it’s made with lotus water, there’s no lotus anything in the ingredients. It’s full of texture enhancers and solvents, IMO they were mainly trying to copy the “gel texture” of the real moisturizer.  The real moisturizer that’s $200 isn’t that much better. No expensive ingredients or actives....Check out the Rovectin Lotus Water Cream, made from 75% lotus flower extract (I’m assuming extracts holds a lot more nutrients than lotus root water), and it’s $20 but it goes on sale for $10, has similar light texture etc etc.  Usually the “made for beauty boxes 111skin products” will have “Made in China for 111skin” on the packaging. The real products use to be made in Bulgaria and now I think it’s made in UK, and some are made in the US.  Even if the ingredients line up like the 111skin vitamin c serum from Ipsy and the old formula of the vitamin c from 111skin’s site, the texture, colour, smell are completely different.  The real one had a serum like texture, transparent, had some kind of smell (I forgot the smell, I compared the products like a year ago).  The Ipsy version has the texture of water, yellow tint, no smell I think. Even the real products from 111skin are total ripoffs...what the hell does that say about the “fake” ones? \n\nTL:DR - both Avant and 111skin products are crap, 111skin sends out fakes to beauty boxes but even the real products are crap.  Avant is a sketchy company and their products aren’t even worth the $12 add on price.  It doesn’t matter if Avant’s website looks legitimate, every MLM website looks a thousand times more legitimate than Avant but it’s still a scam.",

On their Instagram they even have a FAQ where someone asks who the CEO/Founder is, and they say that \"They don't focus on the CEO/Founder but the brand only\"\n\nNot to mention their website copy is absolute garbage and super vague, and though they say they're back by science it seriously just seems like they are using science-washing terms. \n\nCame on reddit and saw this post that validated everything I was feeling.",
