    "body": "For some reason, this post was removed by the mods in r/NoFap. Hence I'll be posting this here as it is related to r/Semenretention as well.\n\nI'm in my early 20s and I used to be addicted to PMO since I was 12 (At least 1 - 2 sessions everyday. Could end up with 5 sessions in a single day. Of course, after each session I would feel sleepy and lazy. I could not even control my urges before and during big moments like examinations and approaching deadlines).\n\nI have stopped for the past month and haven't had an urge strong enough to make me relapse at all. Even if I felt the urge, I was never overwhelmed by it and I had it under control with minimal effort. This was the first time where I felt like I was not even trying to suppress my excessive horniness. It just went away. I don't even think about it anymore. I don't even entertain dirty thoughts in my head. I'm confident in my ability to maintain this lifestyle for the rest of my life.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nWhat worked for me:\n\n*1) Cleaning up my diet.*\n\nI have cut out **all** added oils in my diet and began consuming a salad before every meal. Plus I only have animal products (fish and eggs) for one meal every two days. But I ensure that I meet my daily requirement for healthy fats. As a result I have gotten a lot leaner.\n\n2) *Not having my phone next to me at bed time*\n\nThis one's a no-brainer.\n\n3) *Supplementation.*\n\nI began taking Omega 3 (vegan), Zinc Picolinate, Ashwagandha & Bacopa monnieri extract. I'm not sure if it is a placebo, but I'm fairly certain that Bacopa and Ashwagandha give me a mental clarity that aid me in suppressing my desires. I take Omega 3 and Zinc since I follow a primarily plant based diet.\n\n4) *Doing heavy resistance workouts 6 times a week and playing basketball at least twice a week.*\n\nThis probably helps me feel tired enough to drain my body of its ability to feel horny all the time.\n\n5) *Improving my posture*\n\nI used to hunch a lot when I walk. Now, I maintain a more neutral thoracic spine and appear and feel more confident and masculine as a whole. This was a product of strengthening the muscles around my neck and upper back.\n\n6) *Adopting a more conservative view*\n\nThis one is probably a little controversial, especially here on reddit. But I began to value and respect modesty and the sanctity of sex and females in general. I began to view immodestly dressed women as distractions more than anything else. This by no means mean that I do not respect them. I simply think of them as tests that I have to pass with my newfound will power :)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nNow, I did not isolate the individual factors to see which was the most effective at curbing my addiction. But I don't want to. I'd like to attribute my success to my general sense of well being.\n\nI have had at least 5 unsuccessful attempts at quitting in the past where I would relapse within 2 weeks. My past attempts were unsuccessful as I felt like I was simply trying to not do it instead of tackling it from a different angle (eg. well being and mental health). Once I did relapse, I would go at it for 3 to 4 times in a row and end up feeling depressed.\n\nI have used this quarantine period as an opportunity to better myself. I understand that staying at home all day could breed negative thoughts. But it doesn't have to!\n\nIf negative reinforcement does not work for you, try approaching the problem from another angle. You could have been fighting the wrong battle all along. Focus on something else. All of us are built differently and we respond to different stimuli differently. You don't have to go cold turkey either. It started with me doing it less frequently until I just did not feel like doing it anymore.\n\nGood luck!\n\nP.S. Feel free to ask me anything!",

    "body": " **The Woodroof Protocol** \n\n*A method of reducing withdrawal,*  \n\n*support tapering and prevent relapse*  \n\n*I dedicate this work to everyone struggling with addiction as well as those, helping the*  \n\n*increasing number of people, out there suffering. From the parent worried sick about their*  \n\n*child, to the healthworkers and professionals each Day fighting to save the lives of those, still*  \n\n*stuck in addiction.*  \n\nMy dear American friend whom I had the pleasure of getting to know and helping to taper  \n\nfrom a severe opiod-addiction, inspired me to write this to share with you.  \n\nThis information will be of great value, if you’re trying to recover, or currently helping  \n\nsomeone, recover from addiction to: stimulants, opioids and GABAergics.  \n\nHere below is a short guide, that summarizes the findings made from Years of experience  \n\nworking within this field making personalized regimens of supplements with very promising  \n\nresults.  \n\nThe individual regimens are all legal, non-toxic, non-addictive, natural and most importantly  \n\nbased on evidence. They can all be bought or ordered online, at a reasonable cost and self\u0002\n\nadministered or used alongside other treatments etc.  \n\n**Introduction:**  \n\nI wanted to show my appreciation for Woodroofs work and courage making treatments  \n\navailable back then, fighting for the rights of people, who weren’t offered the best  \n\ntreatment they knew at the time.  \n\nWoodroof is a referal to Ronald Dickson Woodroof (1992) who founded the famous Dallas  \n\nBuyers Club which later was made into the movie by the same name. R.D.Woodroof through  \n\nthe buyers club, distributed medicine to treat Aids during the hardship in the 80’s. Today we  \n\nsee addiction is killing more people each Year than Aids did when it was most rampant in the  \n\nUS. Not only OD’s but addiction-related suicide as well as alcoholism is widely spreading,  \n\ncreating torn apart families and isolated individuals, all who are in dire need of our help.  \n\nThis story ressonated with me, as I started a non-profit myself about 3 Years ago, where we  \n\ncollectively bought large amounts of supplements to save money and to get around the  \n\nlegislation in my country. I would then make personalized blends of these for a lot of cases,  \n\nbut especially for people struggling with addiction and cases where our psychiatry had failed.  \n\nI quickly started getting people referred to me struggling with stimulants, opioids and  \n\nGABAergics but were also able to help in a lot cases with somatic diseases and I had to keep  \n\nlearning and read up on the studies as well as scout the internet for knowledgeable sources.  \n\nI was educated as an intercultural and international socialworker, later having studied  \n\nanthropology and globalization, although I have no background in medicine, this must be  \n\nmentioned.  \n\nI suffered a minor TBI (traumatic brain injury) 10 Years ago, and I had to learn, how to  \n\nrecover from the cognitive issues and did a lot of experimentation and researched neuro\u0002\n\nregeneration and supplements for Years which meant I was familiar scouting for resources,  reading studies as well as looking for interactions.  \n\nI needed to dive deep into the individual effects of minerals, vitamins, amino acids,  \n\nadaptogens and nootropics and the different synergies, and found some very interesting  \n\nfinds regarding possible addiction treatments and support, and I have witnessed some very  \n\npromising results.  \n\nThese following regimens and advice is what I’ve seen having the highest rate of recovery as  \n\nwell as the lowest rapported issues with relapse, accute withdrawal as well as PAWS (post\u0002\n\naccute-withdrawal-symptoms) while and after tapering. Studies are linked beneath each, for  \n\nfurther reading.  \n\n*If you’re on any other medication or supplements, then either get a medical professional*  \n\n*to look into interactions before trying any of these or if you proceed on your own hand,*  \n\n*make sure either ask on i.e. Reddit / FB groups, or Google substance-x + substance-y +*  \n\n*interactions and do a bit of reading.*  \n\n**I. Opiods**  \n\nWarning, this blend of supplements potentiates opiates to a high degree, meaning if you’re  \n\non an active taper, then dose lower than you’re used to before trying these, approximately  \n\nhalf your usual dose. It also means you can do a far more rapid taper and use these before,  \n\nas well as after, your last dose during the taper, to reduce RLS and PAWS here. When you  \n\nhit a wall and your body starts reacting with WD’s, then hover at that dose for a few Days  \n\nand then continue cutting down a little less aggressive from there on.  \n\n1. Bacopa Monnieri Extract\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_300mg-3000mg pr. Day in 1-4 doses  \n\n2.

Vitamin C (Sodium Ascorbate)\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_50mg-100mg pr.kg divided in several doses\\*  \n\n\\*Before starting the vitamin C, I recommend to read up on this link:  \n\nhttps://ericazelfand.com/vitamin-c-for-opioid-addiction/  \n\nIf you suffer from hemochromatosis, skip the vitamin c though.  \n\n\\*In some cases where you’re coming off a dangerously high dose of fentanyl or methadone,  \n\nthen substituting with kratom alongside this regiment can be useful in certain cases, but it  \n\nmust be said kratom in of itself is an opioid with risk of addiction. It’s the lessor of two evils  \n\nthough and for some can have benefits, if they can’t get suboxone etc. It will work fine,  \n\nalongside this taper as these supplements also potentiates the kratom and suboxone a lot. If  \n\nyou’re trying to get off kratom the same supplements will help you too.  \n\nBacopa (BM) can require a step by step increase to avoid stomach issues, so start with a low  \n\ndose. Some people get slight diarrhea dosing high on BM, so always dose right after a fatty  \n\nmeal, or just use Psyllium husks and some butter/oil before taking the BM, although a large  \n\nmeal containing fats, is the most effective way mitigating this. Also certain bad extracts  \n\ntends to make the diarrhea inevitable even in low doses and with food so if you’re unlucky  \n\nto get your hands on a bad extract, try giving another a go before you give up on BM as it is  \n\ntruly effective when it can get absorbed. Both the vitamin c and the BM needs to get adjusted for by slowly increasing until you reach  \n\nbowel tolerance. A meal before, with the fiber and fats seems to shorten this period.  \n\nBM in higher doses causes a slight fatigue and some prefer to take 200-500mg of rhodiola  \n\nextract early in the Day to counter this because if the rhodiola is taken late, it will hinder  \n\nsleep.  \n\nBacopa has a long history of use for opium-addiction in India but have recently been studied \n\nand hailed for it’s effect of diminishing discomfort and reducing WD’s as well as the dose  \n\nneeded for painrelief etc. Agmatine and BSO also show great potential for reducing WD’s  \n\nand managing PAWS as shown in the studies.  \n\nI will refer to a few studies here but for more detailed information, I recommend reading or  \n\nskimming the PHD dissertation about the potential of bacopa in opioid dependency as well.  \n\nFor further reading on each supplement Google each + opioid + studies or opiates, and read  \n\nabout some of the studies or old threads about these.  \n\n Effect of bacopa monnieri on morphine dependence and tolerance to analgesia in  \n\nanimal models (PHD Thesis)  \n\nhttp://prr.hec.gov.pk/jspui/bitstream/123456789/2010/2/1574S.pdf  \n\n Effect of Bacopasides on acquisition and expression of morphine tolerance  \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/50289046\\_Effect\\_of\\_Bacopasides\\_on\\_acqui \n\nsition\\_and\\_expression\\_of\\_morphine\\_tolerance  \n\n A new and novel treatment of opioid dependence: Nigella sativa 500 mg  \n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19385474/  \n\n Thymoquinone: From Nigella sativa to a protective pharmacological compound in  \n\nmanaging opioid dependence and amphetamine type stimulant issues  \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7395189/  \n\n Effect of agmatine on the development of morphine dependence in rats: potential role  \n\nof cAMP system https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15541421/  \n\n Agmatine Prevents Adaptation of the Hippocampal Glutamate System in Chronic  \n\nMorphine-Treated Rats https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5563829/  \n\n Attenuation of heroin withdrawal syndrome by the administration of high-dose vitamin  \n\nC  \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/236834375\\_Attenuation\\_of\\_heroin\\_withdr \n\nawal\\_syndrome\\_by\\_the\\_administration\\_of\\_high-dose\\_vitamin\\_C  \n\nI recommend to continue this regimen for a while after seizing the last mg’s of opiates as  \n\nthis prevents relapse by a great deal as well as helps to bring the body back into homeostasis  \n\nas bacopa increases synaptogenesis as well. You can skip the high dose vitamin C when  \n\nyou’re out of the woods and just get a good multivitamin and some omega 3’s to maintain  \n\nthe effects. The rhodiola also acts as a powerful anti-fatigue and anti-depressant for post  \n\naddiction lethargy. Most get great relief from doing this regiment for longer periods as they  \n\nreport it helps keep them clearminded and manages their cravings for opiates, is what I’ve  \n\nexperienced from feedback. The doses can easily be lowered to more sustainable levels that will still offer relief from  \n\ncravings. On the last page I have some recommendations for other natural compounds with  \n\nneuro-regenerative proporties that also reduces cravings for alcohol and drugs that can be  \n\nworth looking into to add to, as well as substitute for some of these when you get clean and  \n\nfree from WD’s again.  \n\n**II. Stimulants**  \n\nWarning, do not use mucuna alongside an active taper still using stimulants. You should be  \n\nable to stop or do a rapid taper with the others and continue with the mucuna but do so  \n\nonly, when you’re off the stimulant. In most cases it is easier just to stop and substitute with  \n\nthis regimen as it will reduce cravings, mental instability as well as physical WD’s very  \n\neffectively. Also be aware that polygala potentiates stimulants so dose lower than usual  \n\naround 2/3 normal dose and monitor your reactions if you are going to taper off without \n\nmucuna. If any sign of discomfort arises, wait to use polygala also until you’ve tapered down  \n\nusing the others.  \n\n1.

Bilberry/blueberry  \n\nextract also has neuroprotective proporties on the dopaminergic system as shown from the  \n\nstudies below. It’s best to get bilberry as it contains 4-10x higher the amount of  \n\nanthocyanins but a higher dose of blueberry extract will also work. It is though not  \n\nrecommended to use mucuna for lengthy periods due to risk of neurotoxicity so later, you’ll  \n\nbe able to, instead drop the mucuna, and add NAC + d-phenylalanine which is a precursor to  \n\nthe l-tyrosine, alongside the others. This is once you’ve been clean for at least a Week and  \n\nmanaged the most severe craving and WD’s. \n\nIn case you’re showing troubling signs of brainaging due to stimulant-use, you can add  \n\nbacopa to this stack as well, as evidence is showing it is acting as a powerful neuroprotectant  \n\nin meth+mpp induced neurotoxicity and it’s effect of synaptogenesis will aid here, as well.  \n\n(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9414486/)  \n\nPair it with rhodiola 200-500mg if you experience fatigue or depression from the PAWS that  \n\nwon’t dissapate with the supplements.  \n\n Antioxidant-Enriched Diet Affects Early Microglia Accumulation and Promotes  \n\nRegeneration of the Striatal Dopamine System after a 6-Hydroxidopamine-Induced  \n\nLesion in a Rat https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.4137/JEN.S10424  \n\n Blueberry- and spirulina-enriched diets enhance striatal dopamine recovery and induce  \n\na rapid, transient microglia activation after injury of the rat nigrostriatal dopamine  \n\nsystem https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0014488605002797  Dopamine mediated antidepressant effect of Mucuna pruriens seeds in various  \n\nexperimental models of depression  \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4213977/  \n\n Neuro-Cognitive Effects of Acute Tyrosine Administration on Reactive and Proactive  \n\nResponse Inhibition in Healthy Older Adults  \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6084775/  \n\n Tyrosine influence on amphetamine self-administration and brain catecholamines in the  \n\nrat https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3786355/  \n\n Effects of dietary tyrosine on L-dopa- and amphetamine-induced changes in locomotor  \n\nactivity and neurochemistry in mice https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2080188/  \n\n Polygalasaponins effective against antipsychotic treatment  \n\nhttps://patents.google.com/patent/KR100378323B1/en  \n\n Antidepressant Principles of the Roots of Polygala tenuifolia  \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/6804019\\_Antidepressant\\_Principles\\_of\\_the \n\n\\_Roots\\_of\\_Polygala\\_tenuifolia  \n\n Hypothesizing Balancing Endorphinergic and Glutaminergic Systems to Treat and  \n\nPrevent Relapse to Reward Deficiency Behaviors: Coupling D-Phenylalanine and N\u0002\n\nAcetyl-L-Cysteine (NAC) as a Novel Therapeutic Modality  \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4760695/  \n\nI also recommend you continue this regiment for as long as you experience cravings or fear  \n\nyou might relapse. Just switch the mucuna after the critical phase and instead use NAC + d\u0002\n\nphenylalanine and perhaps bacopa if there’s some damages from a long period of addiction.  \n\nYou will easily be able to find a lower or even a higher, functioning dose of the supplements  \n\nthat suits your need for repair and relief. The most important part is you move further and  \n\nfurther away from relapse and get the natural energy and drive to get back into a healthy  \n\nlifestyle again. In general people I learn who’ve forgotten or stopped their supplements,  \n\nafter they get clean, tends to relapse, way more often, than those who keep their regimens.  \n\nSo use this for as long as needed and read the part about alcohol and managing cravings  \n\ndown at the bottom. If you feel some resistance to using supplements or want to learn more  \n\nabout other kinds of medicine like these, I advice you to download the free guide, linked to  \n\nat the last page.  \n\n**III. GABA**\n\n**’ergics**  \n\nWarning, don’t completely seize your use of benzodiazepines abrubtly. Plan a careful taper  \n\nas risk of seizures can be highly dangerous, especially in the higher dose-range. This regimen  \n\nwill potentiate benzodiazepines also, as well so be aware to dose lower in the beginning  \n\nuntil you get a sense of how much potentiation, for the benzo, you’re currently on.  \n\nApproximately to 1/2 and then if WD’s kick in dose a bit higher until you feel okay and if you  \n\nget high vice versa. If you’re using a benzo that is metabolized fast like alprazolam it can be  \n\nworth to slowly adjust and start using a benzo with a longer half life like clonazapam and  \n\ndiazapam to better be able to cut doses and not worry about getting into WD’s at every hour.

This regimen will make you able to taper fast  \n\nand effective down from the baclofen too.  \n\nGlutamate surges from excitotoxicity when tapering, often creates severe adrenal fatigue,  \n\nmental instablity and wearyness, after a while and here it is also important to make sure to  \n\nget a enough vitamin b6 and you’ll also be able try kava, NAC and l-theanine, alongside this,  \n\nto prevent these symptoms. Magnolia modulates GABA-a but there’s not many studies on  \n\nemoxypine even though safety has been well-established. Regarding emoxypine, you can \n\nfind a wide arrange of user reports that backs it’s efficiency in tapering which were  \n\nconfirmed from my own observations.  \n\nAll of these together, can bring a bit symptoms of fatigue due to the combined effects of the  \n\nsupplements. If this becomes an issue take 200-500mg of rhodiola extract early in the Day to  \n\ncounter this because if the rhodiola is taken late, it will hinder sleep. Lemon balm and  \n\nmagnesium glycinate can be a help in getting some sleep, in certain phases in the WD’s if  \n\nyou taper aggressively.  \n\nUse this like the other regimens for as long as you need the support and when you’re  \n\ncompletely off all benzodiazepines and stabilized, then you can switch the magnolia extract  \n\nto sabroxy extract, and this will help your brain heal faster due to increased BDNF,  \n\nneurogenesis as well as synaptogenesis. Bacopa too has effects of synaptogenesis and will  \n\nhelp mitigating symptoms of alcohol WD and craving and can be useful to add, once you’re  \n\noff as well.  \n\nBenzo induced neurological dysfynction (BIND) can require more of the neuro-regenerative  \n\neffects in general and higher doses. I suggest you download the free guide, linked to at the  \n\nlast page, and look into, sabroxy, polygala, bacopa, sulforaphane, emoxypine and the  \n\nneuropeptides as a start.  \n\n Agmatine Inhibit The Tolerance To The Anxiolytic Effect Of Diazepam In Rats  \n\nhttps://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Agmatine-Inhibit-The-Tolerance-To-The\u0002\n\nAnxiolytic-Of-Patel-Bhartiya/077ecdcea512f2298acc528f3d70944c04e8c01f  \n\n Magnolol, a major bioactive constituent of the bark of Magnolia officinalis, induces  \n\nsleep via the benzodiazepine site of GABAA receptor in mice  \n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0028390812002894  \n\n Effect of Magnolia officinalis and Phellodendron amurense (Relora (R)) on cortisol and  \n\npsychological mood state in moderately stressed subjects  \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/255705487\\_Effect\\_of\\_Magnolia\\_officinalis\\_ \n\nand\\_Phellodendron\\_amurense\\_Relora\\_R\\_on\\_cortisol\\_and\\_psychological\\_mood\\_state\\_ \n\nin\\_moderately\\_stressed\\_subjects  Promising effects of emoxypine and its succinate derivative in the management of  \n\nvarious diseases-with insights on recent patent applications  \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9389226/  \n\n \\[The results of the study of the efficacy and safety of mexidol in patients with chronic  \n\ncerebral ischemia\\] (Mexidol = Emoxypine) https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26081329/  \n\n Kava as an anticraving agent: preliminary data  \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/11205899\\_Kava\\_as\\_an\\_anticraving\\_agent\\_ \n\npreliminary\\_data  \n\n Bacopa monnieri abrogates alcohol abstinence-induced anxiety-like behavior by  \n\nregulating biochemical and Gabra1, Gabra4, Gabra5 gene expression of GABAA receptor  \n\nsignaling pathway in rats  \n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332218383914  \n\n**III. I.Alcohol**  \n\nDealing with alcoholism often get’s tricky as this is tied deeply into culture as well as  \n\npatterns of engaging in much needed socializing.  \n\nThis regimen of supplements might be able to reduce most of the cravings and help with  \n\nmany of the issues from a physiological point of view. While on the other hand, the isolation  \n\nand mental toll it takes to step outside of the festivities, often tend to push people back into  \n\ndrinking or worse even, into drugs.  \n\nKava shows some very promising results being a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA-a  \n\nreceptor which means it doesn’t have much addiction potential at all, yet mimicks a lot of  \n\nthe effects from alcohol. In a lot places now, people are beginning to bring kava for  \n\nthemselves for going to parties, to manage social anxiety and peer-preassure as well as  \n\nexperiencing the enjoyment of being a part of the letting loose.  \n\nKava has shown to act as a powerful anti-cravings agent as shown in the study below, not  \n\nonly for alcohol but most drug of choices tested on the group.  \n\n**My anecdotal observations:**  \n\nMost people who’ve gotten clean, functional and even stopped drinking due to it leading  \n\nthem to do drugs, often told me about them getting a nagging evening restlessness. In  \n\ngeneral how it would get their head spinning about relapsing just once etc.  \n\nThose who tried kava all reported that it took away that sense of craving and it helped them  \n\nrelax and unwind when they got stressed enough to begin fantasizing about drugs and  \n\nalcohol. Some of those who didn’t want the kava, managed to stay clean, while others  \n\nunfortunately found themselves, slip a few times.  \n\nBut they often reported, that having the supplements and knowing the way back, kept them  \n\ngetting back to living clean very quickly after.  \n\nA theory of this is, could be due to the role alcohol and cannabis has played for thousands of  \n\nYears perhaps, being incoded in our biology, to come to a point where the need, for just  \n\nsome kind of recreational effects for some, becomes highly unbearable to cope with.  \n\nThis is why I often advice people in risk, to get to learn about kava and have at least a little  \n\nbag of instant/micronized kava lying around, so they know they’ll be able to push the panic  \n\nbutton on the accute cravings.  \n\nThe point of kava being highly adviced as the lessor of two evils is displayed in these  \n\ninfographics here: (https://sci-hub.st/10.1177/0269881119841569) **Kava and safety:**  \n\nKava got a bad stain from back in the 90’s when some medicinal companies bought up a  \n\nkava-company and shortly after started making acetone extracts of leaves and stems which  \n\nwasn’t allowed. A few cases with people with pre-existing liver issues and even alcoholism  \n\nand medication on the side, in a rare instants experienced hepatoxicity and the pharmaceutical industry, in a collective effort, blew it out proportions. The most likely cause  \n\nof this, is hypothesized to be, the rapid increase, in loss of sales of benzodiazepines and  \n\naddictive sleeping medication, which they began seeing as kava increased in popularity back  \n\nin the late 90’s. Multiple peer-reviewed studies have since put these claims to rest, and  \n\nthese are linked to beneath. As a comparison acetylsalicylic acid, also known as aspirin, was  \n\nactually found, to be more dangerous than kava.  \n\n “Kava Lebertoxisch?” DAZ.online. https://www.deutsche-apotheker-zeitung.de/.../uid- \n\n5590.  \n\n “Kava Toxicity.” https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1442-2026.2000.00107.x.  \n\n “A Plant Kavalactone Desmethoxyyangonin Prevents Inflammation and Fulminant  \n\nHepatitis in Mice.” https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0077626.  \n\n “Kava Feeding in Rats Does Not Cause Liver Injury nor Enhance Galactosamine-Induced  \n\nHepatitis.” . https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2007.01.015.  \n\n “Lack of Evidence of Kava-Related Hepatotoxicity in Native Populations in Savaii,  \n\nSamoa.” https://www.herbalgram.org/media/12000/issue59.pdf.  \n\n “Yangonin Protects against Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease through Farnesoid X  \n\nReceptor.” Phytomedicine: International Journal of Phytotherapy and  \n\nPhytopharmacology https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2018.09.006. \n\n “Effects of Kava Root Extract on the Liver Morphology of c57bl-6 Mus Musculus Mice.” \n\n44. http://www.amgs.or.kr/New/common/journal/vol4\\_no.13.PDF.  \n\n “Anxiolytic Action and Safety of Kava: Effect on Rat Brain Acetylcholinesterase Activity  \n\nand Some Serum Biochemical Parameters. http://dx.doi.org/.  \n\n “Chemical and in Vitro Toxicity Analysis of a Supercritical Fluid Extract of Kava Kava  \n\n(Piper Methysticum).” https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.01.032.  \n\n “Flavokawains A and B from Kava (Piper Methysticum) Activate Heat Shock and  \n\nAntioxidant Responses and Protect against Hydrogen Peroxide-Induced Cell Death in  \n\nHepG2 Hepatocytes.” https://doi.org/10.3109/13880209.2015.1107104.  \n\n “Aqueous Kava Extracts Do Not Affect Liver Function Tests in  \n\nRats.” https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2003-40658.  \n\n “Safety of Ethanolic Kava Extract: Results of a Study of Chronic Toxicity in Rats.” \n\nPhytomedicine: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2006.01.006.  \n\n “Kava Hepatotoxicity: Comparative Study of Two Structured Quantitative Methods for  \n\nCausality Assessment.” . https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2710.2009.01131.x.  \n\n**Finishing words:**  \n\nReintegrating your lifepath back into your original flowstate again, can be difficult, as all  \n\naddiction tends to originate from trauma of some sort, but also create a lot of trauma in of  \n\nitself. Most of us, are also carriers of multiple generations of traumatic experiences and all of this, if not treated, will hinder our journey into the higher levels of emotional and spiritual  \n\ngrowth. These regimens can provide us with a long window of opportunity to begin to find \n\nyour way back into progressing with a healthy lifestyle. But if the addiction-issue, is taken  \n\nlightly, and given enough time, the signs of trauma’s will come clawing their way back and  \n\nhave you risk relapse.  \n\nI see a lot, find great comfort in religious community with a strong faith as well as evolving  \n\nvalues of reciprocity to newcomers. Some start to exercise a lot and eat healthy again, as  \n\nwell as reach out to new friendgroups. Some show great benefits from getting therapy or  \n\ncounseling for that extra assistance in unraveling, certain kinds of severe trauma. Others go  \n\ninto Eastern and spiritual practices like Qigong and Yoga and start to meditate. A  \n\ncombination of all of these would be ideal, but focus on one step at a time. There are many \n\npaths back to healing and a good marker for progression here, is if your eyes are getting  \n\nkinder, your voice is becoming softer and you begin to feel and see the traumas, of others,  \n\nand wants to be in service of some sort.  \n\nA short story we can use to remind ourselves.  \n\n*A long time ago, a therapist explained to me.*  \n\n*\"Once a woman told me that she would always love being intimate with her husband*  \n\n*because then after that his eyes would be mild and kind.*  \n\n*A man then told me how he loved making his wife laugh, because after that, her voice*  \n\n*would become soft and playful.*  \n\n*Lastly a young child told me, how the child loved being around and being in service to the*  \n\n*parents, because after that, they would listen and stay present, just as ready to cry with*  \n\n*them as to laugh with the them.*  \n\n**Counter-intuitive strategies**  \n\nFor those who at some point will seek out, some kind of therapy this here beneath, might be  \n\nworth knowing.  \n\nPTSD therapy offers relief for around 20% of people with PTSD, while MDMA-facilitated  \n\ntherapy shows results of around 80% instead. If you suffer from PTSD or severe trauma, and  \n\nyou can’t get this therapy where you’re at, using kanna extract (preferably MT55) and  \n\ngetting a good therapist to work with, will help you up the percentages. This is because  \n\nkanna works very similarly to MDMA. Just let the therapist know politely, that you’re  \n\nsupplementing with a herbal extract while you’re there, to treat your anxiety, and most will  \n\nhave no issues with this.  \n\nThe promising aspect of this, is that now, you can have Weekly sessions instead of having to  \n\nwait 2-3 Months in between each, as with MDMA due to sideeffects and toxicity. Although \n\nbe careful that the euforic effects of kanna doesn’t act as a trigger so be mindful about this  \n\nbefore proceeding.  \n\n The safety and efficacy of ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted  \n\npsychotherapy in subjects with chronic, treatment-resistant posttraumatic stress  \n\ndisorder: the first randomized controlled pilot study  \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3122379/  \n\n Acute Effects of Sceletium tortuosum (Zembrin), a Dual 5-HT Reuptake and PDE4  \n\nInhibitor, in the Human Amygdala and its Connection to the Hypothalamus  \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3828542/  A Chewable Cure “Kanna”: Biological and Pharmaceutical Properties of Sceletium  \n\ntortuosum https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8124331/  \n\nThis picture below, can be a great opener in the first stages of acknowledging and  \n\nunderstanding our trauma.  \n\nCredit for picture: u/imabritnotayank (Reddit) \n\n**Further reading:**  \n\nYou can find a more comprehensive guide on these and other supplements as well as good  \n\nplaces to buy from and save money etc. called: A Short Guide To Using Powerful Healing  \n\nMedicines In A Modern Age, on this link. https://fastupload.io/GPMqH19NazVNJNk/file  \n\nIf the link stops working or if you have any inquiries, reach me on this email, I’ll try answer  \n\nwithin a few days : Stefanjohansen@live.dk  \n\nIf you want to donate to our work  \n\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?business=UHL52DQEL5D2C&no\\_recurring=0¤cy\\_code=USD  \n\nbc1qhd28veysgr84xc3r729tdq4d2hgz9rhx9xllcq (BTC)",

        "body": "Found a piece of text somewhere explaining some parts of bacopa mode of action. \n\nThought it could be intresting for people in this subreddit. \n\n\"Bacopa is a known medical plant since ancient times but also in clinical testing for its memory-enhancing and anti-epileptic properties. It is also one of those common decorative flower plants that you sometimes can buy at your local food store for pots outside. I think it has a pretty good reputation especially in the schizophrenia community, but it seems to benefit NT people too.  \n  \nWhile Baclofen targets GABAb and thereby enhance the NR1 subunit of NMDA receptors (the most common subunit), Bacopa enhances the NR2A subunit and very likely the NR2B subunit too.  \n  \nIt does this by a long pathway that starts at serotonin receptors (5HT2a and others) and M1 muscarinic, up-regulates tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH2) and serotonin transporter (SERT) expression, upregulates reelin epigenetically and thereby benefits the two NMDAr subunits.  \n  \nAt different dosages Bacopa also can act on GLYT1 (inhibiting), can increase GABA mediated inhibition (modulates alpha1, alpha5 and perhaps more subunits that I've forgotten), downregulates TNF-alpha and IL-6 for the benefit of more stable microglia, and also has anti-oxidant properties (ROS, hydroperoxide, malondialdehyd) and raises ATP in mitochondria. Oh yes, and it enhances tha AMPA GluR2 too, and has effects on acetylcholinesterase (inhibiting).  \n  \nDrawbacks are:  \n\\-Takes 2-3 months before memory-enhancing effects can be seen  \n\\-In higher doses has diuretic effect, so be careful if combined with Bumetanide  \n\\-In higher doses has anti-coagulant properties, so be careful if combined with Ponstan, aspirin, fish oil, vitamin K or similar.\"",

        "body": "Green Tea and L-Theanine:\n\nGreen tea, rich in antioxidants, combines with L-theanine to provide a balanced boost in cognitive function. The caffeine content promotes alertness, while L-theanine induces a calming effect, enhancing focus without the jittery side effects often associated with caffeine. This synergistic combination supports improved attention, mood, and overall cognitive performance.\n\nBacopa Monnieri:\n\nBacopa Monnieri, an herb used in traditional medicine, has been linked to cognitive benefits. Its active compounds, bacosides, are believed to enhance synaptic transmission, improve nerve signaling, and promote antioxidant activity. Studies suggest potential improvements in memory, learning, and overall cognitive function, making Bacopa Monnieri a promising natural nootropic.\n\nGinseng:\n\nGinseng, particularly Panax ginseng, has adaptogenic properties that may help the body cope with stress and promote overall well-being. Known for its potential neuroprotective effects, ginseng has been associated with improved cognitive performance, memory, and mood regulation, making it a popular choice for those seeking cognitive enhancement.\n\nRhodiola Rosea:\n\nRhodiola Rosea, an adaptogenic herb, is recognized for its ability to combat fatigue and enhance mental performance. It may alleviate stress-induced cognitive decline, reduce mental fatigue, and improve attention and memory. Rhodiola's positive impact on neurotransmitters and stress response mechanisms contributes to its cognitive-enhancing properties.\n\nLion's Mane Mushroom:\n\nLion's Mane Mushroom contains compounds that stimulate nerve growth factor (NGF) production, promoting the growth and maintenance of neurons. This unique quality suggests potential benefits for cognitive function, memory, and overall brain health. Preliminary studies indicate its neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing effects, making it an intriguing nootropic.\n\nGinkgo Biloba:\n\nGinkgo Biloba, derived from the leaves of the ginkgo tree, is renowned for its vasodilatory effects and ability to improve blood flow to the brain. This enhanced circulation contributes to improved cognitive function, memory, and concentration. Ginkgo Biloba's antioxidant properties may also protect against age-related cognitive decline.\n\nCholine:\n\nCholine is a vital nutrient that serves as a precursor to acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter crucial for memory and learning. By supporting acetylcholine synthesis, choline supplementation is associated with improved cognitive function, memory retention, and learning capabilities. It plays a role in maintaining the structural integrity of cell membranes in the brain.\n\nPiracetam:\n\nPiracetam, a member of the racetam family, is known for its potential cognitive-enhancing effects. Although its exact mechanisms are not fully understood, piracetam is believed to modulate neurotransmitter activity, leading to improved memory, learning, and cognitive performance. Some users report heightened alertness and mental clarity without the stimulation associated with traditional stimulants.\n\nBefore incorporating any of these nootropics into your routine, it's crucial to consult with a professional to ensure suitability and address potential interactions with existing medications or health conditions. Individual responses to these substances can vary, and more research is needed to establish long-term safety and efficacy.",

My goal is primarily to increase focus at work, help with managing stress, and improve mood & motivation.\n\nThese are the items I am planning on ordering -\n\n* Shoden® Ashwagandha Capsules\n* Synapsa Bacopa Monnieri Extract Capsules\n* Magtein Magnesium L-Threonate Capsules\n* Sabroxy® Tablets | 10% Oroxylin-A\n\n  \nIs there anything that I need to be careful of in particular regarding having them or if there's anything that may cause an issue if the ones mentioned above are taken around the same time?\n\nPlease feel free to suggest any alternatives and addition/omission to the stack that had helped you. I had also gone through other options like Cognizin and OmegaTau capsules, but leaning towards starting with the above stack for now but my knowledge is limited hence seeking some inputs here.",

The advice of taking it at night doesn't work because it builds in the system overtime will be slow during the day.\n\nThat's why Cognance was invented even though idk if we can consider it Bacopa 100% anymore at this point.\n\nShoden is great. All Ashwagandha can bring ahedonia within 3 months of use. Dont recommend KSM66.\n\n\n\nOne risk of mood boosters is that you are so satisfied you will not chase desires. You are desire fulfilled embodied. Or that you just want to sit around and enjoy it.\n\nFor mood totally recommend Lemon Balm. Works instantly doesnt need time to build up in the system. But like all things tolerance can come eventually.",

    "body": "I've been struggling from debilitating anxiety and ADHD undiagnosed since my early teenage years. Tried lots of SSRI, SNRI, Wellbutrin, benzos with a little help and ended up in hospital from benzo withdrawals and two seizures. Past year I have been experimenting with nootropics and think I have found a sweet spot for anxiety-ADHD related problems. My anxiety levels were overhelming to the point I could not stand out of a bed for half a year... Anxiety actually came out from ADHD symptoms I couldnt manage and I really messed my life in long term because of that (financially wise, relationship wise...) So after my years of struggle and trying different psych meds I tried to do research of my own and after two months of this stack I can say I got my glasses and lasers back on the track!\n\nSo basically the stack is following\n\nHigh quality omega 3-6-9 two capsules in the morning\n\nNALT - 500 mg in the morning\n\nCDP-choline 200 mg in the morning\n\nInositol 200 mg in the morning\n\nPhosfatidylserine 100 mg in the morning\n\nAcetyl-L-Carnitine - 500 mg in the morning\n\nBacopa monnieri extract 4:1- 100 mg in the morning\n\nGinkgo biloba extract - 60 mg\n\nDMAE - 20 mg in the morning\n\nB6 (pyridoxine) 2,7 mg\n\nhigh quality B12 (cyanocobalamine) 10 µg\n\nVitamin D 2000 UI with the food\n\nhigh quality piperine extract (95 %)  3mg\n\n(not a nootropic but prescribed AD) Remeron 30mg for sleep\n\nyerba mate - daily\n\nhigh protein diet with quality veggies, no sugars except beer :)\n\nSo basically this stack started working after month or so initially my symptoms worsened but suddenly after one month I felt happy for the first time with plenty of motivation, focus, anxiety alleviation, decrease in impulsive drinking, organization. So everyone out there who is feeling like their life is fucked up badly like I felt, please try this combo and be patient, I know each one of us its different but this stack literally made all the meds I have been through obsolete! I even decreased my benzo usage and only use Remeron for sleep. Let me know your thoughts and maybe what to improve.",

After reading reviews, in particular a review from /u/MisterYouAreSoDumb I noticed that users reported an increase in deep sleep time. \n\nFor those unaware Nootropics Depot sleep formula includes: \n\n* Lemon Balm 10:1 Extract 500mg\n* Bacopa monnieri Extract 200mg \n* Uridine Monophosphate 200mg\n* Magnolia Bark Extract 100mg\n* Oleamide 100mg \n* PrimaVie Shilajit 100mg \n\nhttps://nootropicsdepot.com/sleep-support-capsules-natural-sleep-aid/\n\nI'm wondering what I should stack in the morning to make the best use of this sleep stack as I do suffer from brain fog and general low motivation in the mornings. I am open to suggestions but would at a minimum like to maintain the following in the morning:\n\n* Vitamin D 6000iu\n* Vitamin K2 120mcg\n* DHA 525mg\n\nI'm looking for a minimal morning stack (maybe adding 1-3 to the above). \n\nI will highlight I am more serotonin dominant due to actively taking an SSRI (escitalopram), which obviously leads to some of the lack of motivation, focus, and lack of dopamine I feel notably in the mornings. (Disclosure: I have experimented with all the nootropics in the poll below and have not had a negative interaction with escitalopram)\n\n**Here is a full list of nootropics at my disposal in the Poll below:**\n\nhttps://www.strawpoll.me/42355630",

Not too sure what to add for sleep, possibly theanine and/or Ash depending on how it agrees with you.",

    "body": "Hello all! You might remember my post, if not: [initial decline/functional autonomic failure](https://www.reddit.com/r/MinoxidilSideEffects/s/fFbOL4LLlL)\n\nIn short I very nearly died from taking oral minoxidil, as it turns out there is more to my health than doctors were assuming.\n\nI’m happy to answer any questions as to how we came to my diagnosis, as it is still being tested and proven, and I believe this is my experience with the genetic predisposition and associated illnesses/syndromes that cause side effects from this drug.\n\nI can only speak to my experience, this is an anecdotal case study that may help others to better represent themselves to their doctors. If anything I am saying doesn’t make sense; feel free to ask any questions.\n\nI have a background in medicine but it has to be said:\nI AM NOT A DOCTOR. I AM NOT YOUR DOCTOR. I urge anyone reading this to use this as a reference guide, a case study to bring to their medical professionals.\n\nIt seems as though I have ehlers danlos syndrome, MCAS (specifically hereditary alpha-tryptasemia syndrome, symptoms present in the small intestine) gastropariesis, and actually had a milder form of functional neurological disorder before taking this drug that was misdiagnosed as fibromyalgia. \n\n\nPast physical dx as follows:\n\n\t⁃\tfibromyalgia, dishydrotic eczema on the elbows\n\n\t⁃\tAmenorrhea\n\n\t⁃\tIBS-C\n\n\t⁃\tIdiopathic nerve pain\n\n\t⁃\tReactive airway disease\n\n\t⁃\tReynauds phenomenon (chillblains) \n\n\t⁃\tamblyopia (corrected with an eyepatch at age 5)\n\n\t⁃\tBorn without 60% of my enamel\n\n\t⁃\tUnresponsive to Iidocaine and other local anesthetics\n\n\t⁃\thypermobility\n\n\t⁃\tBarrett’s esophagus (treated with sucralfate, no longer needed)\n\n\t⁃\tPulsatile tinnitus\n\n\t⁃\tMigraines with aura\n\n\t⁃\tCervical neck instability\n\n\t⁃\tL5S1 bulging disc (age 12)\n\n\t⁃\tSciatica\n\n\t⁃\tHigh ACE score\n\n\t⁃\tMore of an anomaly but I have very flat grey (almost blue) eyes, indicative of collagen overgrowth in the iris. Genetically both of my parents have hazel eyes.\n\n- poisoned with a form of kerosene as an infant/newborn\n\n- intolerance of fluoroquinolone antibiotics (caused tendonitis)\n\n- tic disorder (now meets diagnostic criteria for Tourette’s although with management I am getting control over them. Worse with anxiety/panic)\n\n\nFamily history dx of:\n\n- polycythemia\n- MCAD\n- colon polyps\n- sarcoid cancers\n- diverticulitis\n- autism\n- spinal collapse\n- ptsd\n- fibromyalgia\n- heart defects \n- congenital epispadic defects\n- seizure disorder\n- eczema\n\n\nmy doctors are testing me for other illnesses that are likely associated with the genetic expression that it is associated with. Some of this is conjecture based off of my family history, some of this is diagnostic procedure of exclusion and some of this is cautionary awareness of its associated illnesses.\n\nI was sent to he ER after an ambulance was called on me and due to the division of specializations in medicine, each doctor was looking at it with too much of a myopic view. My first specialist, cardiology, referred me to functional medicine which my insurance will not cover; I have had to learn to be my own advocate in creating a cohesive theory as to what went wrong, with the guidance and help from my doctors for proper testing and consultation about what changes I have made at home.\n\n\nSpecialists I have been referred to:\n\n\t⁃\tfunctional medicine\n\t⁃\tCardiology (attended)\n\t⁃\tNeurology\n\t⁃\tGastroenterology (attended)\n\t⁃\trheumatology\n\t⁃\tAllergist\n\t⁃\tPsychology\n\t⁃\tPhysical therapy\nI am looking to also see a genetic specialist in any of these fields.\n\n\nI am hesitant to start pharmacological medication as by the function of FND, my body appears to be extremely sensitive to drug concentration; over responding to anything that I take.\n\nI have made strict dietary and lifestyle changes at home that have given me a turnaround time that is unseen based off of the experiences that have been shared here.\n\nI would like to especially thank u/oddblood3435 for their post and references to kATP as a treatment for aspects of this. My younger brother is a bodybuilder as well, and I can’t help but laugh when I think about how nuts he is about working out, and the careful attention to detail that you share with other redditors on here is compassionate and caring. Thank you.\n\nWhat began as trying to understand what minoxidil was even doing in my body, began an entire overhaul of my life and how I care for myself. Although I am still recovering and this process may take six months to a year; I am grateful.\n\nMy boss has leased me a sewing machine so that I can work remotely as a private contractor until if/when I am able to return to work in person. I consider myself incredibly lucky despite my insurance dropping me right when this started. So it goes.\n\nMinoxidil works as a potassium channel opener, blocking the deposition of calcium into the intracellular matrix. This disrupted my disease process of EDS to a degree that it could not be ignored any longer. Your unique side effects are due to how your body already works, it will exacerbate symptoms and side effects of any pre existing illness or medication, respectively, as potassium regulates just about every single cell in our body.\n\n\nMy personalized goals are:\n\n\t⁃\temotional stability/managing the associated manic presentation (past dx history of panic disorder, PTSD w/psychotic features, OCD, Pica, Dissociative disorder [unspecified])\n\n\t⁃\tManaging Gastropariesis (with attention to chronic constipation that compounds on itself, causing intestinal blockages of shit)\n\n\t⁃\tTo monitor inflammation in the body and histamine, as they play a role in the development of autoimmune diseases. I am currently not presenting with ANA, RF, Celiacs, etc although my CRP, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were high.\n\n\t⁃\tManaging nerve pain (while also using it as a form of biofeedback not only for my emotional state, but also which systems of the body are not being cared for)\n\n\t⁃\tDevelop lean muscle tissue as I gain weight to keep my body fat percentage just below 20% (personally I have  found that higher body fat percentage worsens my condition [for reference to adipose fat as an endocrine mediator, lipodema in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome])\n\n\t⁃\tTo sleep through the night\n\n\t⁃\tTo cut out dietary allergens and intolerances upon proper testing [colonoscopy, endoscopy in a month, gastric ultrasound in a week. I suspect they will schedule a small intestinal biopsy as it can be used to identify presence of defective mast cells as was found in my maternal grandmother] \n\n\t⁃\tTo restore my period after five years [suspected ashermans syndrome after a medical accident during IUD insertion. It has been very difficult to get anyone to listen to me when I have exhausted all other measures of changing my hormonal birth control, ommiting it entirely etc… period was lost at a healthy weight]\n\n\t⁃\tTo manage my most bothersome symptoms while also carefully monitoring for signs of liver and kidney dysfunction (past CT performed during urosepsis hospitalization in September 2024 revealed a lesion off my liver proximal to the hepatic vein)\n\n\nUpon waking up:\n\n\t⁃\tFOOD GRADE diatomaceous earth (1 tsp) suspended in water \n\n\t⁃\tAloe Vera gel (2Tbsp) suspended in water \n\nAbout one hour after I drink coffee with a tsp of a seed oil, usually sunflower or olive oil (oleic acid for its role in vitamin D mediation in the amygdala)\n\nIF gastric symptoms have worsened, I may also drink a senna tea before my coffee. I try to avoid this while also being proactive that my constipation is an accumulative issue. (Careful monitoring of electrolyte balance is required, I highly recommend chronometer. It has a free version I’ve used for years but I bought the gold version as my health requires careful monitoring now)\n\n\nMorning vitamins to be taken with breakfast:\n\n\t⁃\tN acetyl-cysteine (600mg) with selenium (mcg) [neuroprotective acetyl-acid, also works to mitigate risks of atherosclerosis]\n\n\t⁃\tL-arginine (500mg) [protects against oxidative stress and inflammation]\n\n\t⁃\tPQQ (40mg) with coq10 (10mg) [mitochondrial biogenesis, I recommend something with coq10 for its supportive role in this process]\n\n\t⁃\tMushroom powder supplement (1g of powdered concentrate) [something comprehensive for its nootropics and vitamin D]\n\n\t⁃\tDiatomaceous earth (food grade) [this is a silica based agent that can have a laxative effect, but is also used to improve gastrointestinal immunity. This has also been studied for its effects on reducing cholesterol. Do not take with food or medication as it can affect absorption. Talk to your doctors]\n\n\t⁃\tComplete vitamin b complex [personally I have a hard time absorbing b vitamins, folate and iron due to MTHFR genetic expression. Working to methylate folate through diet alone, this is hard on my kidneys but good enough for now)\n\n\t⁃\tLithium orotate (5mg) [mediates the nervous system, based off of theory and lithium blood labs performed during Urospesis hospitalization, blood serum levels were at 0. This mineral should be present in all food and water but due to concerns about lithium mining, I wonder if it is less bioavailable than it used to be. This will be monitored by my doctors]\n\n\t⁃\tPotassium iodide (150mg) [mitigate exhaustive strain on my thyroid by the b vitamins at the dose I am currently taking]\n\n\nAt night (taken with or without food):\n\n\t⁃\tMelatonin (3mg) [as needed, the body will begin to regulate and adjust its circadian rhythm. This was to begin signalling a more appropriate bedtime and improve sleep hygeine]\n\n\t⁃\tMagnesium (500mg) [supplementary, I struggle to get enough in my diet, it imrpoves sleep quality and mediate digestion]\n\n\t⁃\tQuercetin (800mg) with bromelain (165mg) [supports the immune system, my MCAS is worse/more active in the evening]\n\n\t⁃\tL-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine (600mg) with bacopa monnieri extract (300mg) [precursor to acetyl-choline, a critical amino-acid the gut uses to digest food] do not take this at the same time as the NAC as they will compete for absorption.\n\n\t⁃\tZinc (50mg as pressed pills, cut in half to minimize depletion of copper)\n\nBefore strength training in/with a cinnamon apple tea:\n\n\t⁃\tcreatine monohydrate powder (5g) [amino acid that brings water to the muscle tissue, increasing the efficacy of workouts]\n\n⁃\tTaurine (free form powder, 1g) [to improve distal vascular dilation, this has immediately improved my exercise intolerance and I am not in pain after working out anymore]\n\n\t⁃\tGlucosamine chondroitin powder (glucosamine sulfate 1044mg) [collagen support]\n\n\t⁃\tCollagen peptide powdered supplement (vital proteins brand, can be substituted with bone broth or gelatin powder) [may be working to lower this intake as the supplement is expensive, but my body has a high demand for it. This is a working theory as Ehlers Danlos Syndrome is poorly understood]\n\n\t⁃\tAshwagandha (500mg) with ginger (10mg) (consider sensoril or jam-66 variants as better studied for mental health) [as needed, careful monitoring of signs of hormonal overactivity. Ashwaganda promotes testosterone, which metabolizes into estrogen. Men need to add an estrogen blocker]\n\n\t⁃\tSaw palmetto (450mg) [mediates the hormonal balance and metabolization process. Men may notice ED issues if taken for too long. Taken with ashwaganda]\n\n\t⁃\tTMG ? (1000mg observe with interactions absorbing acetyl group proteins and folate) [I have not taken this medication yet. I am suspecting if all of my other measures fail, glycerin increases absorption rate]\n\n\nWith harder to digest meals:\n\n\t⁃\tbeef liver capsule (ancestral supplements brand) [to likely be replaced with beef pancreas, a natural DAO to help digest food and my manage my intolerance to high histamine foods]\n\n\t⁃\t10 strain Probiotic capsule (physicians choice brand) [to encourage food digestion and healthy gut microbiota. I have found it most beneficial to open a capsule and sprinkle half on each meal as I can only eat two solid meals a day, lunch is liquid]\n\n\nAs needed to fill in routine gaps in nutrition:\n\n\t⁃\tvitamin e (268mg) with mixed tocopherols (26.75) [promotes and mediates healthy scar tissue formation, a part of the Ehlers Danlos disease process, I struggle to get enough of it in my food. This is a fat soluble vitamin, use caution to avoid chronic overdosing]\n\n\t⁃\tIron (25mg) [do not take with vitamin E as they compete for absorption]\n\n\nNutrition goals:\n\n\t⁃\t150g of protein, daily (calculated to my current metrics, 27f 5’6” 95lb now [up from 90lb a month ago])\n\n\t⁃\tFat intake must be kept below 50g\n\n\t⁃\tPrioritize complex carbs, simple sugars can be eaten at the end of a meal if I do not have enough energy with a focus on honey, dates, fruit, or home made delicacies (within reason)\n\n\t⁃\tCarefully chewing food and maintaining emotional hygiene during meals (no phone, chew food slowly, I do not eat when I’m upset and get in touch with my feelings before I eat as emotional instability=nervous excitation=symptoms worsen)\n\n\t⁃\tTiming intake and ingredients to maximize absorption of naturally occurring vitamins and minerals (vitamin c with dinner because I’ll have a red meat, calcium based foods like yogurt with my mushroom supplement in the morning to maximize abortion of vitamin d, etc.\n\n\t⁃\tChronometer (referenced below) has a section where it collects your weekly (or any time period you select) averages on your intake. This has been valuable to allow for more fluidity between days and goals for the week; at first I had to eat and do every single thing every day in constant maintenance to get my symptoms under control. (I listed management protocols I followed in the order to which my intervention required, you may be able to skip ahead from where I began.\n\n\nLifestyle changes:\n\n\t⁃\twaking up I make my drinks and sip them (timed appropriately) as I wake up mentally. This is as I’m writing this, anything I sort of dreamed about [dreams are our emotional interpretations of the day prior, useful for understanding myself and reinforcing what I have been learning]\n\n[example morning intake (added herbs to focus on DHT blocking qualities)](https://imgur.com/a/rP6k1hB)\n\n\t⁃\tBreakfast is appx three to four hours after waking up (wake up at 6:30 lately) This is my biggest and most calorie dense meal, focusing on easy to digest foods. I will include an example day of my intake.\n\n[example breakfast](https://imgur.com/a/E92jVlY)\n\n\t⁃\tStretching about 30min.  afterwards with yoga poses to encourage digestion and wake up to my more physical part of the day [remote work as a sewist, errands, more active chores etc..]\n\n\t⁃\tLunch is a liquid drink (about 2-4 pm) with preworkout nutrition. I prefer to strength train in the afternoons to manage stress\n\n[example lunch](https://imgur.com/a/sGSAxBr)\n\n\t⁃\tStrength training for about 1hour. Targeted muscle groups (leg day, arms day, prioritizing compound exercises and stretching in between sets, etc..)\n\n\t⁃\tDinner is a smaller meal (as I wake up in the night due to stomach cramps) but must be eaten at least three hours prior to bedtime.

I keep epsom salts to manage pain to use in my baths but prefer to wash my hair in a shower (every 3-4 days due to my hair type, I sleep with a antimicrobial silk bonnet and prefer protective hair styling as I have fine, 3b curly hair and low oil output although this may change as I manage my hormonal balance)\n\n\nUseful accommodations to otherwise manage symptoms:\n\n\t⁃\telectric blanket [reynauds and chillblains, cold feels like death and due to my severe weight loss I currently struggle to maintain body temperature]\n\n\t⁃\tImmediate action cold packs often used in hospital settings [biofeedback to cope with extreme anxiety/panic attacks/worsening of physical symptoms]\n\n\t⁃\tI took the time to organize my phone, utilizing my to do list, notes app, widgets and such in a way that is both ergonomic, peaceful to look at and meets my needs. I chose to remove my nonessential apps off of my Home Screen so that I only visit them with intention. My phone is a happy place now and my boundaries with social media… honestly I don’t even want to get on there anymore except to scream into the void via my drawings, seeing projects etc… social connection is still invaluable in managing health. Find your safe people, do not waster your energy.\n\n\t⁃\tI am interested in getting an oura ring when I can afford it to lessen the amount of biofeedback monitoring that is currently taking up all of my time, I’ll lyk if it’s worth it.\n\n\t⁃\tAir filter next to my bed, dehumidifier as well but not necessary where I live at the moment)\n\n\t⁃\tI vape, I am a recovered addict and alcoholic (ages 12-25). Although I don’t recommend anyone start smoking, if you do smoke I have been congratulated by doctors as vaping, transdermal patches and nicotine gum are the safest modes of delivery of nicotine. Disposable vapes use propylene glycol, which is largely fine if you do not experience symptoms of pleghm accumulation. Nicotine itself is actually neuroprotective in some ways, and although I am looking to quit I need to get my symptoms under control as cessation causes heart palpitations for me.\n\n\t⁃\tTENS machine [maximize healing and minimize lactic acid bulldup]\n\n\t⁃\tYoga mat [taped with alignment guides to pay careful attention to proper form]\n\n\t⁃\tSmall cans of low sodium v8 [if i need calories when im out and about]\n\n\t⁃\tMio caffeine pods [taken liberally with water, less is more]\n\n\t⁃\tSmall bars of 85% cacao chocolate \n\n\t⁃\tNeck massager\n\n\t⁃\tTennis ball (punctured so it isn’t as hard) [for self performed myofascial massages in the evening or as pain begins to tighten]\n\n\t⁃\tWhite noise machine\n\n\t⁃\tRollator walker [necessary initially as I would collapse in public due to the overstimulation on my nervous system, I had to get to my appointments somehow]\n\n\t⁃\tPrescription sunglasses, infrared-blocking glasses and regular prescription glasses [various levels of filtering, infrared migraine filter are especially helpful in setting with fluorescent lights as flourescents and LEDS actually flash at rates below what we can consciously detect, some studies have been performed on this causing seizures in dogs and cats in residential settings.

        "body": "Hi there! Since using topical  minoxidil back in November for only a week, my face is extremely bloated, I have bag under my eyes, facial sagging that makes me look 10 years older. Besides that Minoxidil gave me folliculitis and scalp infection that made me lose 70% of my hair. I felt my life was destroyed as I lost all my looks and was severely depressed to the point I didn’t leave the house anymore. But I didn’t know the worst was yet to come. About a month ago all of a sudden my joints started to hurt and click and crack with every movement all over my body. They feel extremely unstable and I’m basically bedridden now. Also my skin on my body became very lose and thin, I can pull the skin everywhere and it stretches a lot. It also became very thin so that my arteries and veins are very visible. The worse is on my hand, with the veins showing and the thin skin, they look like the hands of a 60 year old. I read on Reddit that for some people minoxidil triggered EDS like symptoms and I’m now very sacred that I have this. I already have lipedema so I may have had a predisposition for Ehlers-Danlos. I am very scared now and don’t know what to do. Tests at doctors for rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune disorders were negative. I wake up with panic attacks and my whole life is just torture at the moment. I am very depressed and so scared it won’t get back to normal. 5 months ago I was an active healthy attractive woman and now I lost all my looks, youth and health. I cry and panik everyday. Doctors tell me I’m imagining things and minoxidil can’t cause that. Reading your post gave me a bit of hope that there may be a cure. So if you or anyone knows anything that would help my condition you would save my life. I am currently taking: high dose vitamin C, curcumin, omega 3, vitamin D, iron, Pumpkin seed oil, Blackseed oil, Amino acids, hair vitamins (with biotin, zinc etc.), Q10, collagen peptides and Magnesium. Please help me my life is miserable.",

This can cause toxicity among other issues. Research what it acts on and what benefits it provides before just throwing it down the hatch, as well as what should/can be taken daily and which ones should be taken sparingly.",

I'm concerned because I don't drink a lot of pills.\n\nI don't know if these are safe to take together.\n\nI'm currently 26 years old. I want to try nootropics because I'm experiencing short-term memory loss, brain fog, depression, procrastination/no energy to work. I also can't seem to quit fapping even though I've tried NoFap many times. I also have troubles waking up early. Hopefully, this can get my life back and regain my energy.\n\nI planned to go to a shrink and have myself checked to resolve these problems. But I'm scared that they might just recommend anti-depressants to me. I've read around here that anti-depressants have a lot of heavy side effects. Hopefully, Nootropics will help solve my behavioral problems.\n\nThe entire stack that I'm planning to take is listed below. I've also included the brand, in case it's needed. I mostly bought Swanson because their stuff is really cheap and I couldn't find any negative comments about them. They also ship to my country easily.\n\n**Breakfast (after eating)**\n\n* 1-2 - Swanson Ultimate Ashwagandha KSM-66 - 250mg\n\n* 1 - Swanson Bacopa Monnieri Extract Bacognize - 250mg (45% Bacosides)\n\n* 1 - Powder City Caffeine - 100mg\n\n* 1 - Swanson Suntheanine, L-Theanine - 200mg\n\n* 1 - Powder City Racetam or Noopept (use only when needed)\n\n* 1 - Powder City Alpha GPC (use with racetams/noopept)\n\n* 1 - Swanson Super EPA Fish Oil - 1g\n\n* 1 - Swanson Vitamin D3 - 2,000iu\n\n* 1 - ALCAR - 500mg\n\n* 2 - Orange Triad Multivitamin\n\n* Optional - 1 - Modanifil to become alert in the morning if needed (for all-nighters, jetlag, etc.)\n\n**Lunch (after eating)**\n\n* 1 - Swanson Fish Oil - 1g\n\n* 1 - Swanson Vitamin D3 - 2,000iu\n\n* 1 - Swanson Activated B-Complex\n\n* 1 - Optimum Nutrition Creatine Monohydrate - 3g (after loading period)\n\n* 2 - Orange Triad Multivitamin\n\n**Dinner (after eating)**\n\n* 1 - Swanson Fish Oil - 1g\n\n* 2 - Multivitamin (Orange Triad)\n\n**Before Sleep (empty stomach)**\n\n* 1 - Swanson Bacopa Monnieri - 250mg (45% Bacosides)\n\n* 1-2 - Swanson Ultimate Ashwagandha Extract - 250mg\n\n* 1 - Swanson Magnesium Citrate - 225mg\n\n* 1 - Melatonin 3mg (if needed)\n\nI was also wondering if these are safe for my kidney or liver?

Some of us experience brain fog and sleepiness from this substance, so I would suggest you take it only at night and see if you feel any better during the day.\n\nYou should really try each substance on its own for a week, to see what it does for you. I finally did this and found Noopept, Bacopa, Rhodiola and Lions Mane extract made me sleepy, so I moved them to my evening stack.\n\nYou could also try a higher dose of melatonin (I take 10-30mg).  Without it I have trouble falling asleep, and then wake up every two hours.  With low doses my PTSD fueled dreams are terrible (vivid dreaming). There are few if any side effects from using higher dosages.  You'll notice if you take too much that you will feel hungover, so then you back off in 5mg steps untill you wake up refreshed.\n\nThere are many ways to break your free running and chronic though patterns; meditation is one of them.  Reading, exercise, puzzles, video games, music (listening and playing) could also help.  Remember, doing something with your brain breaks what I call the \"Idling\" compulsions.",

        "body": "Trying to adopt a bunch of extreme changes all at once is pretty hard. It can easily lead you to fail at one or two of them, which makes you want to give up everything at once. Gradual changes are a lot easier to handle.\n\nWith nootropics in mind, you're stacking a whole boatload of things all at once without really understanding what your problem is. Some of them are just generally good for everyone, so you can add them in (fish oil, vitamin d, multivitamins, magnesium), but a lot of them have varied results. They work for some people, they don't work for others. If you start loading a giant stack and it isn't working or seems edgy for some reason, you won't have any idea which substance is causing the problem. Add one thing at a time or well-understood pairs (e.g., caffeine + l-theanine), give it a week, then add in something more once you understand how your brain likes it.\n\nSince you mention jogging and weight training, I assume you're pretty sedentary. Doing some regular light cardio can make huge psychological changes if you're depressed from lack of activity. I'd highly recommend bringing that in ASAP because it can have profound effects. (I also notice that a lot of people in their mid/late 20s start needing this because their lifestyle was a lot more active until they were 22 or so, and then the office finally caught up with them.)\n\nI recommend vitamins + light exercise for a couple of weeks, THEN check in to see how your mood is and get a blood test. See if you have any basic deficiencies that you are working with. Try to get into a state of good physical health before you move on to taking nootropics. IMO, nootropics are generally for optimization, not to completely address problems. \n\nRe: \"how to meditate\". Set a timer for 10 minutes. Sit still with your spine straight. Relax and don't fidget. Pay attention to your breath. When you notice your attention wander, bring it gently back to your breath. Stop when the timer goes off. That's it.\n\nbtw, there are a lot of different types of therapists. Some of them might be gung ho about anti-depressants which I agree is a pretty big stick to address your problems with if you don't make some basic health fixes first. But others are more like coaches and will work with you to improve your habits and thinking styles. One example of a style of therapy like this is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.",

A good example of this is melatonin; everyone should be taking either 1mg or even 0.5mg, demonstrated to be **more effective** than 3mg or 5mg. More is not necessarily more effective, and this goes for dosage as well as multiple substances.\n\nBased on your description of what you want to do, I would recommend just Ashwagandha regularly, and caffeine/theanine as a stimulant as needed intermittently. Ditch everything else.\n\nMultivitamins excluded- they're fine if your diet is irregular or nutritionally poor but not necessarily nootropics. Fish oil, I feel, is in a similar position.\n\nWhatever regimen you settle on, keep it simple, and stick to it for several months before you experiment again.",

It's a high fat, moderate protein, NO carb diet. I'm on mobile right now but I'll go over your nootropic list and comment when I get home.\n\nAlso, cold showers and meditation are absolutely necessary.

    "body": "I will try my best to answer any questions that anyone has. I am seeking advice as I am definitely at a different phase in treating my insomnia and also hope this post can be encouraging to some others trying to get off of prescriptions.\n\nI started developing insomnia at the age of 13. When I went to my parents with my sleep issues, my mother gave me Benadryl which seemed to help for about two years. Then I developed a complete immunity to it. At that age, I believe my insomnia was mostly anxiety related as I did not have the best school experience. \n\nFrom ages 15-18 I went to see multiple specialists and had 3 different sleep studies done. On average i was sleeping 1-2 hours a night.  Between this age, I tried over 20 different prescription medications before finding a combination that somewhat worked. I have a list (somewhere) if people are curious what all they tried me on. I had 3 sleep studies done, only one was considered \"successful\", as they let me take my sleep medication for that exam. They noticed that I only briefly entered REM sleep on that study. They wanted to take a spinal tap but since I found a combination that worked, I did not pursue it.\n\nFrom ages 18-30 I took 1MG of Ativan and 25-50MG of Elavil each night. While there seemed to be no short-term side effects for me, after several years I started experiencing long term side effects such as some memory loss. I also generally felt like I was in a dream like state most days, or my days felt very blurry/hazy, even when i was getting 5-6 hours of sleep on the medication.\n\n4 months ago I went to my doctor and told him I wanted to get off my prescription medication entirely. Every 3 weeks I have been reducing my medication and am now down to .25MG of ativan and at 25MG of elavil (amitriptaline). I will be starting the further reduction of elavil once I am off ativan completely. It's important to note I do have a vitamin B deficiency \n\nAt this point I want to say a few things that has helped overall and also ask some advice.\n\nSome things that have helped over the years and especially over the past few months.\n\n1) Exercising daily/every other day. This seems to help the most. I do up to 30+ miles on a bike a few days a week intentionally to help with my sleep.\n\n2) Reducing stress in life. We all have stress in life. I actively do things to try to reduce it in my life. Such as taking on less projects at work or spending more time with friends+family. Having your work/life balance in check does help me sleep\n\n3) Natural remedies that work so far for me: I've tried quite a few, but Valerian root tends to be a decent substitute for ativan at this point. This tends to work best for me so far.\n\nI've tried many others. List below:\n\nMelatonin\nKAVA\nChamomile tea\nvitamin b6/b12\nL-Tryptophan \nHops\nLemon Balm\nPharmaGABA\nMagnesium\nCalifornia Poopy Extract\nSensoril AShwagandha\nScullcap extract\nbacopa monnieri extract\nL-theanine\n\nThese above have not had much affect on me, though many of them have been in combined forms.\n\nI am looking for others who may have been on this medication and decided to go off of it. I've searched the forums for other natural remedies and found many things that I am trying but would like to find more that I might be able to try as I continue reducing my medication. At the moment I am getting around 4 hours of sleep per night but would like to get to at-least 6. Any further advice is appreciated of natural/herbal things to try.\n\nI know this problem is beatable and think I have a chemical in-balance that has always caused my insomnia. I believe it is possible to get off of my dependency on prescription medication, which is why I am trying. Thanks for reading.",

        "body": "Our 24% bacopa is very similar in bacopaside ratio to Bacognize, but with double the amount. So taking 300mg of our 24% bacopa would be like taking 600mg of Bacognize. They are scored tablets, too. So you can break them in half. This makes them more cost effective and more flexible in dosing. So think of our ND brand bacopa as a double potency Bacognize. Bacognize's bacopaside specs are NLT 12%. Ours are NLT 24%.\n\nSynapsa is a specific extract called CDRI-08, which was researched and developed by the government of India. I would say this one feels different. It actually has about the same amount of bacopasides as Bacognize when looking at the USP mongraph. However, there are a couple other peaks that are not integrated as well. So there are other things in there that likely have effects, but they are not quantified or called bacopasides/bacosides. Identifying and quantifying them would be theoretically possible, but take a lot of work to do. Their NLT spec is 8%, but some batches are higher than that. Most of the time Synapsa is about the same % as Bacognize.\n\nWe are actually working on another bacopa extract that we are patenting that will be totally different than all of them. I can't talk about that one too much, but it feels TOTALLY different than any other bacopa on the market.",

I have read what each one does, i've read what i've found so far on side effects, and if it comes in capsules or powder.\n\nAre there any nootropics that could help me that I've missed in my list? I'm sure there are a few.\n\nNow come the questions.\n\nAre capsules more ideal for a beginner? I understand that with powders you can measure and create your own blends, but for some who is completely new to these, is it safer to stick to the pills?\n\nIs the caffeine in Caffeine and L-Theanine capsules different from \nCaffeine Anhydrous, and if so, how? Anhydrous seems to be more powerful. Judging by the recommended doses, it seems to be a one or the other deal. Can they both be taken on the same day?\n\nI keep reading that bacopa makes people tired/drowsy/sleepy, is this reason to avoid it? If so, what are good alternatives that don't cause those symptoms.\n\nDo people generally avoid those russian nootropics? Might be a stereotype, but russian products are not exactly known for their quality and I'm hesitant to use something \"dodgy\" that may harm me.\n\nI'm a little lost on the cycling of nootropics. For example, say I take some Caffeine + L-Theanine capsules everyday for a week, must I take a week off? What about 30 days straight, a week off? 2? I don't know of the cycling for each of those in my list. I'm assuming that moderation is the key to using all of these nootropics, but are there any big risks to lack of cycling? Dependency? Building of tolerance?\n\nAn important point I'd like to make is I want to be able to drive, I would like to avoid any nootropics that decrease my motor skills.\n\nI don't consume alcohol, tobacco or recreational drugs.\n\nI don't have any allergies or illnesses that I'm aware of and I'm not taking any prescription medication.\n\nCurrently, I have no trouble sleeping.\n\nI'm lost as to what goes with what, which nootropic is compatible with another, I don't want to mix 2 nootropics that don't go well together.\n\nI don't exactly have the money to \"try and see what works for you\" and buy 50 bajillion nootropics. I have a generous budget, the prices on powder city are appealing.\n\nI know I have alot of questions, perhaps i'm asking too much, but any help is appreciated.\n\nTo put it simply, I'm lost and I need help & guidance.",

I'm very reluctant to try medication for numerous reasons, and I did notice that taking serotonergic supps recently such as l tryptophan and saffron seemed to help.

Would love to capture some level of that through supplementation, without all the negative that come with drinking.\n\nHere is a stack I'm considering, but could use input on whether it's too much, as well as best time of day to take them, etc. -- or anything else I should consider adding in!\n\nMorning\n\n\\* ND Bacopa monnieri extract (debating between this or Synapsa?)\n\n\\* ND Black ginger and C3G (not specifically for serotonin but seems to help with mood)\n\n\\* ND Rhodiola rosea\n\n\\* ND l theanine\n\n\\* ND Saffron extract\n\nLunch\n\n\\* sulforaphane (BROQ)\n\n\\* fish oil\n\nEvening/before bed\n\n\\*Thorne NAC (1 - 1.5g)\n\n\\* ND l theanine\n\n\\* ND Black seed oil extract (10% thymoquinone)\n\n\\* NOW l-trytophan\n\n\\* ND Apigenin\n\n\\* ND cistanche\n\n\\* NOW Taurine\n\n\\* Jarrow magnesium l-threonate/magtein\n\n\\* ND Tongkat ali (heard it can help with mood, was already planning to cycle it for testosterone)\n\nDoes that seem pretty solid?\n\nEdit: might try Inositol too, Huberman mentioned this in his OCD podcast episode, but it's in my multivitamin already so maybe I don't need extra.",

Plus I can feel the acute effects during the first half of the day taking it in the morning (short half life).\n\nDefinitely add agmatine sulfate. Could start low but would want something like 1 - 2g split throughout the day.\n\nOne of the leading theories on OCD is glutamate/GABA imbalances so I would personally avoid all heavy GABAergics, especially alcohol. The glutamate rebound will be worse for you, eventually creating a negative cycle which eventually can lead to addiction (just happened to my friend with OCD, was pretty disciplined and firm on this but now has fallen into addiction due to undervaluing this cycle and overvaluing her discipline).\n\nJust an idea, but I'd try taurine and NAC during the AM, balance out your GABA supplements a little more (although not sure if you should even be taking it).",

You need it to make melatonin, but, if you're eating meat with carbs, then you should be covered.  If you're avoiding carbs, then you want tryptophan on an empty stomach, earlier in the day so it's available once melatonin starts generating at sunset.\n\nI would be careful about having a 'sleep stack' in general.

I typically dose 5x a day on average 17.5 grams a day. Toss N’ Wash\n\nHere’s where things may get a bit trickier...\n\nI use Caffeine but no coffee due to acid reflux.\nI drink sugar free Energy drinks most times \nMonster Hydro the tall plastic bottles screw on/off top, 180mg caffeine. I usually drink about half in morning half afternoon. \nI also drink some Matcha Tea a proprietary blend: \nGreen Tea, Matcha Tea, Turmeric, Cayenne, Piperine, etc. 1x a day. \n\nI try to limit my caffeine intake\nI was drinking 2-3 energy drinks a day since I unfortunately cannot drink coffee without being bothered but have reduced my intake thankfully!\n\nI recently started using,\n- L-Theanine powder form 200mg 2x a day.   +\n\n- KSM-66 Ashwagandha powder/ capsule form 300mg 1x a day,\n\n- Bacopa Monnieri extract powder/ capsule form 320mg 1x a day,\n\nAlmost forgot, \nGS15-4 Panax Ginseng extract 200mg 1-2x daily powder/ capsule.\n\n(How bad is Ginseng with everything else and on top of caffeine as well)?\n \nAnd...  \n- Rhodiola Rosea I like the energy it gives me so I use about 200mg of the Salidroside 3% , 1% Rosavin powder form 2x a day.\n\nI initially do extensive research and I even contacted the customer service at ND and they said all three of these, \n(Ashwagandha, Bacopa, & Rhodiola) don’t have any interactions. \n\nI’m taking quite a lot altogether or so it seems especially as of recently! But I’ve been trying to stick to the recommended doses although everyone is different and we all have our own body chemistry, etc.\nAnd I usually take all of these every day. \n\nBtw,\n*I was having headaches every now and then from the Kratom before I started these Nootropics actually. The reason behind that most recently occurred to me that it could very well be (Low Blood Pressure). Not only the headaches but when I bend over and reach for something in front of me esp. at work, I work in a fast paced Warehouse! It felt like all the blood was rushing to my forehead and when I stood back up my face felt red and was a bit red for 5-10 sec. or so.\nNothing crazy just stuff like that. \n\n^This isn’t the topic I was going to write out but I thought it would be smart to mention anyway.*\n\nOkay, as stated in the subject... \nI sense the Rhodiola Rosea may be causing subtle Heart Palpitations and subtle Chest Tightness! \n\nDoes this make sense or ring a bell to anyone??\n\nIt’s def concerning and the reason I say subtle is I can still do whatever I have to do but if I’m having these symptoms I’d very much like to understand why!?\n\nSo,\n\n1. What stack could be interacting adversely?\n\n2. Could it be the Zoloft, or Rhodiola, or?\n\n3. What should I do, cut some out completely or just not combine all of these every day?\n\n4. Will I be okay? Lol... \nhas anyone dealt with this their self?\n\nIf I’m going to be taking these things to help me live a better life I need to be able to be Safe and Smart. \nI cannot ignore these symptoms and I thought as I’ve read from many subs and forums before that these Nootropics, Adaptogens, etc. would be okay and not harmful...\n\n\nAny advice or insight would be extremely appreciated!\n\n\nP.S. I take Zantac 2x a day for acid reflux and Flonase for allergies. & I use a scale for most things unless capsulated!\n\n\n",

    "body": "I just read an article that I found interesting, and I think it’s worth sharing. It sheds light on a common energy drink additive called taurine, which could be doing more harm than good. While the research is still in its early stages, it’s definitely something to keep an eye on. Either way, it’s a good reminder that what we put into our bodies truly matters especially when it comes to daily energy and focus.\n\nOne important thing to note: I’m not saying taurine is terrible— it can be beneficial in moderation. But when you see energy drinks loaded with up to 3,000 mg of taurine in a single serving, that’s when it becomes a red flag. More isn’t always better, especially when it’s paired with high levels of caffeine and other stimulants.\n\nThere are options out there that align with what your body is really asking for—nutrients that fuel resilience, without artificial stimulation, caffeine crashes, or jitters. \n\nAlpha GPC\nA highly bioavailable form of choline that crosses the blood-brain barrier, Alpha GPC supports the production of acetylcholine—a key neurotransmitter responsible for memory, learning, and focus. It’s often used in cognitive enhancement and is even studied for age-related mental decline.\n\nATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)\nThe literal fuel of our cells, ATP is what your body uses for energy at the most foundational level. While many products try to “stimulate” energy, ATP supports it directly—powering everything from brain activity to physical performance without draining your system.\n\nTeaCrine® (Theacrine)\nThis powerful compound works synergistically with caffeine to boost mood, motivation, and focus—without the crash or tolerance build-up. Think of it as a cleaner, longer-lasting energy support that doesn’t spike cortisol or interfere with sleep.\n\nCaffeine Anhydrous\nUnlike the jittery energy some caffeine sources cause, this purified form provides a rapid mental and physical lift. When Caffeine Anhydrous is included, it can complement other ingredients to promote alertness without overload.\n\nBacognize® (Bacopa Monnieri extract)\nThis adaptogenic herb has been clinically studied for its ability to support memory, learning speed, and stress resilience. It enhances synaptic communication—helping the brain process and retain information more efficiently.\n\nRhodiola Rosea\nUsed for centuries in traditional medicine, this adaptogen helps the body respond to stress more efficiently. It reduces fatigue, supports mood balance, and is known to improve endurance and cognitive stamina during demanding tasks.\n\nL-Tyrosine\nAn amino acid that acts as a precursor to dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine—your brain’s “get stuff done” chemicals. It’s especially beneficial in times of stress or sleep deprivation, helping preserve mental performance when you need it most.\n\nGlycine\nA calming neurotransmitter that promotes mental clarity and emotional balance. It plays a key role in regulating the nervous system, supporting restful sleep, and protecting the brain from overstimulation.\n\nLonicera Berry\nRich in C3G (Cyanidin-3-glucoside) and potent antioxidants, this berry helps protect brain cells from oxidative stress and supports healthy inflammation levels—promoting clean, sustained energy without the crash.\n\nMaqui Berry\nOne of the most antioxidant-dense superfruits on the planet, Maqui Berry supports clarity and cognitive health by combating free radicals and oxidative stress, which can slow brain performance and contribute to fatigue.\n\nVitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid)\nEssential for the synthesis of coenzyme A and the production of neurotransmitters like acetylcholine. It plays a central role in converting the food you eat into usable energy—especially important for brain function and stress response.\n\nWhen you start learning what these ingredients actually do, it changes the way you look at every label. You begin to see that real energy and focus don’t have to come at the expense of your long-term health.\n\n",

    "body": "13 Nootropics to Boost BDNF\nDavid Tomen\nAuthor:\nDavid Tomen\nPublished: June 10, 2024\n\n8 minute read\nTable of Contents\n\nHow BDNF Supplements Work in Your Brain\nNootropics to Boost BDNF\nAshwagandha\nBacopa Monnieri\nDHA (Omega-3)\nGinseng\nGotu Kola\nL-Theanine\nMagnesium\nN-Acetyl L-Cysteine (NAC)\nNoopept\nRhodiola Rosea\nPterostilbene\nResveratrol\nTurmeric\nThe Optimized Brain\nResearch over the last several years has shown that our brain has the remarkable ability to re-wire itself throughout life.\n\nEvery time we have a new thought, encode a new memory or learn a new skill, we are building a new neural network in our brain.\n\nAnd these tiny neural networks are dependent on an ample supply of BDNF.\n\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a naturally occurring protein that is responsible for the growth of new brain cells, maintenance and survival of neurons.\n\nBDNF prevents apoptosis (brain cell death), induces the growth of new neurons (neurogenesis) and synapses (synaptogenesis), and supports cognitive function.\n\nHigher levels of BDNF can increase cognition, mood, productivity and memory. And decrease the risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease.\n\nIn this post we investigate why BDNF is so critical for optimal cognitive performance. And how you can increase BDNF naturally with a healthy diet and the right nootropic supplements.\n\n\n\nHow BDNF Supplements Work in Your Brain\n\nBDNF is a protein that is encoded in humans by (oddly enough) the BDNF gene. BDNF is part of the neurotrophin family of growth factors which are related to Nerve Growth Factor (NGF).\n\nBDNF regulates whether cells live or die, neurogenesis, axon growth, dendrite pruning, and the expression of proteins critical for normal brain function such as neurotransmitters and ion channels.\n\nBDNF also controls the function of synapses and synaptic plasticity. All while continuing to modulate neuron survival.[i]\n\nWhen BDNF is released, new connections form in your brain by attracting new dendrites from neurons to connect to other neurons or synapses.\n\nThis wiring together of new neural networks is how memory is formed and consolidated. A thought, memory or new skill you learn is the result of a new neural network.\n\nWhen BDNF levels decline, you experience problems with memory and learning, and depression. When you decrease bdnf levels this is why nootropics like Bacopa Monnieri, L-Theanine, and Rhodiola Rosea exhibit antidepressant activity in your brain. They each have the ability to increase BDNF in your brain.\n\nHere we’ll explore many of the nootropics available that can be easily added to our stack to increase BDNF at any age.\n\nnootropics-to-increase-brain-derived-neurotrophic-factor-BDNF\n\nNootropics to Boost BDNF\n\nAshwagandha\n\nAshwagandha is one of the most powerful adaptogens and has been used since ancient times to help the body adapt to stress. In the brain, Ashwagandha has been shown to help regenerate axons and dendrites, reconstruct synapses, and restore neural networks affected by neurodegenerative disease.\n\nAshwagandha performs some of this magic with better brain health by boosting levels of BDNF. And research shows that Ashwagandha can also prevent the decline of BDNF levels in the brain.[ii]\n\nBacopa Monnieri\n\nBacopa Monnieri helps increase levels of BDNF in your brain. Bacopa has been used to boost memory and as an antidepressant for millennia. The ancient Ayurvedic texts recommended Bacopa to devotees to help memorize long passages of text.\n\nStudies show that Bacopa Monnieri improves word recall, increases attention, improves focus and reduces anxiety. A study conducted in India showed that Bacopa Monnieri extract promoted hippocampus neurogenesis by elevating BDNF levels in the brain. And as an antioxidant defense against oxidative stress.[iii]  \n\nDHA (Omega-3)DHA to increase BDNF\n\nDHA (Omega-3) helps increase levels of BDNF in your brain. DHA makes up much of the gray matter in your brain. DHA regulates signaling in your brain, and gene expression. DHA influences neurotransmitters which affect memory, learning, focus and attention.\n\nOne study conducted at the University of California at Los Angeles showed that DHA could restore BDNF levels to normal, even after traumatic brain injury.[iv]\n\nGinseng\n\nGinseng as long been used to improve memory and learning. Most neurohackers using ginseng report feeling more alert. We know that stress can reduce BDNF levels in the brain. This is where ginseng comes in.\n\nOne study showed that ginseng extract affected memory and learning by boosting nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurite growth in the brain.[v] Another study showed that ginseng extract (GRb1) prevented a decline in BDNF levels in animal brains that were subjected to stress.[vi]\n\nGotu Kola\n\nGotu Kola is often called the “student herb” in Bali because it sharpens the mind. Gotu Kola extract increases dendrite and axon growth in the brain which helps boost memory.\n\nThis was demonstrated in a study conducted in China. The researchers found that Gotu Kola extract significantly increased BDNF concentrations in the brain.[vii]\n\nL-TheanineL-Theanine-boosts-BDNF\n\nL-Theanine, which naturally occurs in green and oolong tea, is an amino acid. L-Theanine is used as a nootropic for anxiety, learning, mood, and focus.\n\nA study in Tokyo investigated the mechanism of action L-Theanine exerts in the brain. And why it provides “antipsychotic-like” and “antidepressant-like” effects. The research team concluded that L-Theanine provides antianxiety and antidepressant effects “through induction of BDNF in the hippocampus and the agonistic action of L-Theanine on the NMDA receptor”.[viii]\n\nMagnesium\n\nMagnesium is critical to all of your body’s electrical and electrochemical activities. It’s involved in muscle contractions, heart rhythm, nerve function and brain cell activity.\n\nResearch shows that Magnesium L-Threonate easily crosses the blood-brain barrier (compared to other forms of magnesium). And once in your brain, magnesium increases NMDA receptor signaling, BDNF expression, and synaptic plasticity in the pre-frontal cortex. Increasing learning and memory while impairing fear memories.[ix]\n\nN-Acetyl L-Cysteine (NAC)\n\nN-Acetyl L-Cysteine (NAC) is a powerful anti-oxidant that can boost mood, lower anxiety, improve memory, and reduce compulsive behavior. There is a growing body of scientific literature exploring the use of NAC in the treatment of psychiatric illness.\n\nResearch has shown that NAC helps boost dopamine release. NAC reduces inflammatory cytokines. And NAC acts in the process of glutathione synthesis.\n\nScientists believe this convergence of mechanisms in the brain are due NAC’s ability to promote cell survival and growth factor synthesis, leading to increased neurite sprouting. Partly through activating the BDNF/TrkB signal pathway.[x]\n\nNoopept\n\nNoopept is an ampakine nootropic similar in action to the racetam-class of compounds. And is known for boosting cognition, memory, learning, perception, logical thinking and mood.\n\nA study published by the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences in Moscow shows that Noopept stimulates Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF).[xi]\n\nRhodiola Rosea\n\nRhodiola Rosea is an adaptogenic herb and nootropic that has been used in traditional medicine in Russia and Scandinavian countries for hundreds of years. This herb is known for improving alertness, energy, memory and mood, is anti-anxiety and anti-depressant, reduces fatigue, and boosts cognition and concentration to help keep your brain healthy.\n\nScientists found that Salidroside, the primary bioactive compound found in Rhodiola Rosea extract, significantly increases BDNF levels in the hippocampus.[xii]\n\nPterostilbenePterostilbene increases BDNF\n\nPterostilbene (PTE) is a naturally derived polyphenol antioxidant found in blueberries, grapes, and in the bark of the Indian Kino Tree. This potent antioxidant stimulates BDNF, promotes neuroplasticity (brain plasticity), is anti-anxiety, boosts dopamine, and helps cognition, learning and memory.\n\nIn several studies, Pterostilbene has been shown to modulate gene expression. PTE up-regulates those genes that stimulate apoptosis (programmed cell death). And down-regulates those genes that allow cancer cells for example, to invade and metastasize within your central nervous system.\n\nAnd this gene modulation is linked to increases in CREB and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). An increase in BDNF helps long-term potentiation needed for the development of long-term memory.[xiii]\n\nResveratrol\n\nResveratrol is a polyphenol stilbenoid and phytoalexin that certain plants produce in response to stress, such as injury or fungal infection. This potent antioxidant boosts BDNF, increases cerebral circulation, improves energy and memory, and potentially promotes longevity.\n\nResearchers in Iran found that Resveratrol significantly boosted mRNA and BDNF in the hippocampus. And concluded “that the neuroprotective effects of Resveratrol may be at least partly due to its inducing effects on the expression levels of the BDNF mRNA”.[xiv]\n\nTurmeric\n\nTurmeric (Curcuma longa) has been shown to increase Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), fight depression, improve cognition, focus and libido, and protect the brain from inflammation.\n\nCurcumin, the primary bioactive compound found in Turmeric, produces its neuroprotective effects in the brain by increasing BDNF. And mediating the BDNF/TrkB-MAPK/PI-3K-CREB signaling pathway in the brain.[xv]\n\nIn this post we’ve covered the nootropics we can use to boost BDNF levels in our brain. But the latest research shows several other natural ways to boost BDNF. And they include:\n\nIntermittent Fasting\nHigh-Intensity Resistance Training\nSunlight or Vitamin D\nRestricting sugar intake\nSocializing\nSleep\nThe Optimized Brain\n\nHigher brain levels of BDNF helps support the survival of existing neurons, encourages the growth new neurons (neurogenesis) and new synapses (synaptogenesis), better memory, learning and cognition, and less depression.\n\nBDNF is Miracle-Gro® for your brain and mental health. Use any one or more of the nootropic supplements detailed above to increase BDNF naturally for a highly optimized brain.\n\nOr save some money and get effective amounts of Bacopa Monnieri extract, L-Theanine (as Suntheanine®), and Rhodiola Rosea 3:1 extract in Mind Lab Pro®.\n\nYou can get DHA in Performance Lab® Omega-3s (600 mg DHA & 300 mg EPA) which is an ultra-clean Omega-3 made with life’s™ OMEGA algae.\n\nAnd get Magnesium in Performance Lab® Sleep which contains 100 mg Magnesium (as Magnesium Bisglycinate, Magnesium Taurate, NutriGenesis® Magnesium) combined with 500 mg CherryPURE® Montmorency Tart Cherry, 200 mg Lemon Balm Extract, and 200 mg L-Tryptophan.",

The article includes the sources for all the claims made.\n\n[Article](https://www.leoandlongevity.com/post/protocol-to-enhance-lucid-dreaming) (https://www.leoandlongevity.com/post/protocol-to-enhance-lucid-dreaming)\n\n[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiOztE5Y5c8) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiOztE5Y5c8)\n\nSummary:\n\nNote that lucid dreaming is not possible for those consuming hypnotic tranquilizers or other drugs that inhibit or reduce REM sleep (e.g. THC).\n\nPharmaceutically only acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have been found to induce lucid dreaming in controlled studies: Donepezil, Galantamine. Alpha-GPC failed to produce similar results.\n\nAll nutritional supplements must be taken on an empty stomach before sleeping, waiting at least 2 hours after eating before taking them.\n\nNicotine cholinergic agonism: snus, nicotine pouches / patches. Recommendation is to place an 8mg pouch under the upper lip before bed.\n\nAcetylcholinesterase inhibition: Huperzine A, Bacopa monnieri. Dose: 200mcg of Huperzine A and 300mg of Bacopa monnieri extract before bed.\n\nMinerals: Magnesium L-threonate and Zinc gluconate. Dose : 144mg Mg, 50mg Zinc gluconate\n\nSerotonergic activity: SSRI, 5-HTP, Saffron extract. Dose: 5-HTP 200mg before bed, use it only on days you plan to lucid dream as it can affect the natural synthesis of serotonin. Saffron extract: 150mg standardized to 0.3% safranol.\n\nBe sure not to use Huperzine A, Bacopa Monnieri, 5-HTP, or saffron daily, or you will adapt to them and experience less of a result. Nicotinic receptors upregulate, so nicotine can be used daily, and the body will not adjust poorly to daily use of zinc and magnesium l-threonate.\n\n&#x200B;",

Also, I would always forget a word that was on the tip of my tongue. The worst is when I'm thinking of one word and I end up saying another. It's really embarrassing and annoying.

Couldn't get it anywhere else since it's gray ish in my country and not OTC but heard awesome stuff about this and I'm tired of using benzos to knock me to sleep\n  which often results in memory loss or hypnotic drowsiness.\n- Vita World Rhodiola Rosea extract 500mg\n\n\nNow I need your help/suggestions regarding cylcing/improving my dosage or removing/adding new noots.\nWhat I should say right now: I do not like cofee/caffeine pills nor green tea and just like milk 'n choco with 200-300mg L-Theanin. Hope that doesn't diminish the general well known and awesome effects from L-Theanin.\n\n\nAlso I'm unsure when to use Rhodiola Rosea and if a dosage of 500mg is sufficent for a nice boost in focus.\n\n\nAt the moment I'm doing the following.: (started doing this since 1x week.)\n\n\nMorning (right after standing up):\n\n\n- 20-30 push ups, I know it's not much but it is a start .)\n\n- 1x 1000mg Vit C Bioflavonoide - Time Released pill\n\n- 1x Vitamin D pill\n\n- 1x 1000mg Omega 3- 18% EPA, 12% DHA fish oil capsules \"high dosaged\" from Nature Fitness also with Vitamin E 1mg.\n\n- 1x Swanson Korean Ginseng 500mg pill\n\n- 1x Puritans Pride Ashwagandha Extract 500mg pill (contains Withanolide 15mg)\n\n- Hot warm dark chocolate. I add 200-300mg L-Theanin powder into it and stir it up nicely and wait like 2-3mins tills its completely dissolved. (well sometimes it needs like 10min to dissolve..)\n\nNote: Should also add that I travel to work about an hour and a half. I hope my stuff doesn't diminish till I reach work.\n\n\n\n\nMid day (I consider my mid day starting around 9am - 14pm. That's where productivity has to be high!):\n\n\n- at 9am I swallow my selfmade 25mg Noopept capsule with my Tianeptine Powder Sodium 30-40mg capsule...usually drinking a smoothie with it.\n\n- sometimes I also take 1x Puritans Pride Ashwagandha Extract 500mg pill (contains Withanolide 15mg). But thats only 2-3 times per week when Im battling with a lot of anxiety. \n  I feel like it combines nicely with my Tianeptine Powder Sodium 30-40mg. The time I take the Ashwagandha Extract 500mg pill varies ..\n\n\n\n\n\nLunch break time at around 14pm:\n\n\n- Eating usually almost daily tuna with white bread and 1l water. When there's no tuna I eat some white bread with garlic spread .)\n  Cheap food €2 but does the thing and keeps me healthy I guess. Also always eating 2-3 bananas every 2-3 days.\n\n\n\nAfternoon work day:\n\n\n- 14.30 - 15pm: I swallow my selfmade 25mg Noopept capsule with my Tianeptine Powder Sodium 30-40mg capsule\n\n- 15pm: here the stress stops and people usually go home. I'm there till like 4pm - 4.30pm and deal with normal not so important issues.\n\n\n\nWhen going to bed: (around 11-12pm)\n\n\n- 20-30 push ups again. Not much but o' well. I'm not trying to lose weight just keep a bit in form since I'm tiny. I jog sometimes\n\n- 1x Vitamin D pill\n\n- 1x 1000mg Vit C Bioflavonoide - Time Released pill\n\n- 1x Swanson Korean Ginseng 500mg pill\n\n- 1x Puritans Pride Ashwagandha Extract 500mg pill (contains Withanolide 15mg)\n\n- 1x Sanct Bernhard Magnesium-400-supra 400mg pill\n\n- 1x Bacopa Monnieri Extract 500mg (Brahmi)\n\n- 3x 1000mg Omega 3- 18% EPA, 12% DHA fish oil capsules \"high dosaged\" from Nature Fitness also with Vitamin E 1mg\n\n- 1x 1mg Melatonin pill\n\n- sometimes: 2x 50mg 5-HTP capsules for 3 days after having a nice weekend with MDMA & LSD (only doing it every 3 months. No exceptions!)\n\nNote: usually drinking that all together with a cup of water and then listening to ambient music till I fall asleep or do some more push ups if I cant sleep.\n\n\n\n\nHere's what I read about dosages/cycles from the product description:\n\n\n- Bacopa Monnieri Extract 500mg (Brahmi): daily 1x with a meal and much water\n\n- 1000mg Vit C Bioflavonoide - Time Released: food supplement. 1x pill, 3 times a day.\n\n- Sanct Bernhard Magnesium-400-supra:  1x daily with water. Now I'm still unsure when i should take it. I read people often take it when going to sleep (400mg)\n  and 200mg in the \n\n- Ashwagandha Extract 500mg: daily 2 capsules with meals and water. So is my way correct: one in the morning and one at bed-ish time?\n\n- 1000mg Omega 3- 18% EPA, 12% DHA fish oil capsules \"high dosaged\" from Nature Fitness also with Vitamin E 1mg: daily 1-2 times with water\n\n\n\n\n\nNow what do you think about my dosages, noots and cylcing in general...just say what you got in mind. \n\nI would be so happy about any informative replies. Maybe im overdoing the stuff.\n\nHell, I don't know. I just decided I have to change my life from popping prescription pills daily since it is not good for me. Seriously fuck that shit.\n\nI read bacopa takes up to weeks / 3months to have real effects but that's no problem for me. Should I take it maybe more?\n\nAlso I tried ginseng I few times and noticed no real effects. Should I maybe try a different ginseng \"strain\" or up my dosage?\n\nAlso which racetams would you recommend me for starting out?\n\n\n\nI work as IT dev/engineer and have a very stressfull job but doing good with my co-workers and also on call often but I love it and wouldn't exchange it for anything in the world.\n\nBut often I have issues with productivy. I'm diagnosed with ADHD and have been using ritalin/concerta or dexedrine (european here).\n\nAnyways, I want to do stop that stuff. I don't like it.\n\nMy anxiety is mid-ish. Often I'm a bit nervous about normal dumb stuff but its not that bad.\n\n\nSorry for this long post. \n\nI have informed me but this area is so wide and there are so many different aspects and views of noot users that it's really hard to find something that suits you.\n\nSo I love reading about experiences and suggestions just based on what worked for you.\n\nregards",

    "body": "I recently ordered a 100 capsule filling machine, size 00, and I’ve around 15 or so different nootropic powders in my collection. I have a few questions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- First of all, are there any stats on whether most people here make their own capsules, or mix powders and chug a (measured) spoonful of it back with a drink? I didn't used to bother but I have some new powders that taste really really not so good, and are very difficult to wash down, so I reckon its worth the extra step now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- How important is a mortar and pestle? Is it just to break up small particles to get a more homogeneous distribution? Or does it also noticeably increase how many milligrams you can pack into a single capsule? Also, how many times should I keep tamping the powder down to squeeze in as much as I can? More than twice?\n\nOnce ground down into a fine powder, how great is the variability in density between different substances? Is this something to keep in mind, or can I more or less assume that if I follow the same (grinding and packing) process, I can fit in roughly the same amount (in mg) of various substances per capsule? I think I got about 460mg powder/capsule in my first test run to see how it works (averaged over 100 capsules), but I didn’t grind them up first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- What are some good rules of thumb for figuring out how many different types of capsule to make?\n\nDo you create “these things are ok to take together, every day” all-in-one kind of capsules, then make separate capsules with substances that should be cycled, or taken at different times of day?\n\nOn the one hand it makes sense to combine as many active ingredients that work synergistically together, as there’s no having to mess around with calculating fillers, plus having to make and take fewer capsules.\n\nOn the other hand, this all-in-one approach might produce sub-optimal results in terms of timing and… “stomach status”. To put it another way, I see some people have a morning, an afternoon, and an evening/before bed stack.\n\nObviously, there is value in separating daytime substances (especially stimulating ones) from ones you take before you go to bed, but it seems there would be less of a distinction between morning and afternoon/lunch time…?\n\nOr perhaps the answer lies with making a distinction between substances to take on an empty stomach vs with food. How important is this in terms of efficacy? I suppose it's not something I have been paying all that much attention to, now that I think about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTaking all these things into consideration, what would be a good capsule making strategy and daily dosing schedule timetable for the following (e.g, in the morning and 1 hour before eating anything, with my 1st meal, etc…)? What are some good combinations I can make with these? I ordered them to help with ADHD, mood/depression, anxiety, motivation, focus, brain fog, executive function etc…\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCiticoline (CDP-Choline)\n\nUridine Monophosphate\n\nN-Acetyl L-Cysteine (NAC)\n\nL-Theanine\n\nAshwagandha Root Extract\n\nAcetyl L-Carnitine (ALCAR)\n\nInositol (Myo-Inositol)\n\nN-Acetyl L-Tyrosine (NALT)\n\nSulbutiamine\n\nCoenzyme Q10 Powder (COQ10)\n\nRhodiola Rosea Extract Powder (>3% Salidroside)\n\nAlpha Lipoic Acid (ALA)\n\nLions Mane Mushroom 1:1 Extract Powder (Organic)\n\nBacopa Monnieri Extract\n\nMagnesium L-Threonate\n\nMagnesium Gluconate\n\nZinc Citrate",

Hence, you can use the formula safely without the fear of other health problems. \n\nEvery bottle of ProMind Complex contains 30 capsules which last for a month. It has been suggested to consume one tablet every day for at least a month.  \n\nMost adults report a drastic change and excellent results within a month or two of consumption and go on to take it for even six months for the best results. ProMind Complex is 100% safe for long-term consumption. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How Does ProMind Complex Work?**\n\nAt the core of ProMind Complex's functionality lies its ability to enhance blood flow to the brain. By improving the rate at which blood circulates to this vital organ, ProMind Complex ensures that the brain receives an ample supply of crucial nutrients and oxygen. This increased blood flow serves as the foundation for the supplement's subsequent actions.\n\nOne of the primary effects of ProMind Complex is the repair of damaged blood cells within the brain. Over time, these cells may become compromised due to various factors such as aging, oxidative stress, or neuroinflammation.\n\nThe ingredients present in ProMind Complex work synergistically to target these damaged cells and initiate their repair. This repair process is vital for optimal brain function, as it ensures that the cells can effectively carry out their essential tasks.\n\nMoreover, the supplement aims to provide the brain with the necessary building blocks for optimal performance. Furthermore, ProMind Complex assists in brain cell regeneration. This process involves the creation of new neurons and the development of synapses, which are crucial for proper communication between brain cells.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**Learn more on the official website >>>**](https://promind-complex.healthgrowbeauty.com/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What are the Active ingredients?** \n\n**St. John's Wort:** This ingredient has been tested in several research studies for its effects on cognition and brain health. The ingredient has been added to the formula for its ability to enhance brain function. According to research, a specific amount of this ingredient helps in different ways. First, it helps to increase the neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and others. Next, an increase in the levels of these neurotransmitters enhances mood and works as an antidepressant. This ingredient is an excellent neuroprotective agent and has been found useful in treating Alzheimer's disease. \n\n**L-Glutamine:** This ingredient is an amino acid that helps to maintain a healthy brain by enhancing your gut health and maintaining its microbiota. This ensures that the brain's functioning is not affected by bad bacteria that can enter the bloodstream and cause dysfunction in the brain and its processes. It has been proven by research that gut health is important for maintaining healthy bodily processes, especially the brain and its functions. \n\n**Phosphatidylserine:** This amino acid is involved in several functions throughout the body. It has been added to the formula for its ability to enhance neural communication, reduce anxiety, and maintain brain function. It also reduces the levels of cortisol which is the stress hormone, and hence improves the functioning of your brain. It is also useful for enhancing memory. \n\n**Bacopa Monnieri Extract**: This ayurvedic herb has been for several years for its ability to improve memory. It increases the production of brain chemicals and enhances memory retention, and supports clear thinking. In addition to that, this ingredient can treat anxiety and protects the brain from degenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. \n\n**Ginkgo Biloba:** This ingredient has several health benefits. However, it has been added to the formula for one of its main properties, that is, the supply of antioxidants it provides. Antioxidants are necessary to reduce the effects of free radicals, which damage the cells in the body as well as the brain. Free radicals cause damage to the brain over the years and affect its functioning. Hence, antioxidants are necessary for fighting these free radicals and reducing the damage caused by them. This ingredient also increases blood flow to the brain. This nutritious blood then helps to heal the brain and enhance its function. \n\n**N-Acetyl L-Carnitine Hydrochloride:** This amino acid is found in every cell of your body. It is important for maintaining a healthy brain by reducing inflammation caused by pathogens in the body. It also increases energy production by optimizing the fatty acids in your body. \n\n**Vinpocetine:** This ingredient is a cerebral vasodilator that helps to increase blood flow in the brain. In addition to that, it increases cerebral metabolism by enhancing oxygen and glucose uptake. According to research, this ingredient also helps by preventing neural damage and helps to improve memory. \n\n**Huperzine:** This ingredient is a neuroprotective agent which helps to protect the brain from conditions that affect memory and cognition. It helps to lift brain fog and increases alertness and clear thinking. According to research, this ingredient may be useful in treating Alzheimer’s disease. This suggests that it may slow down the degeneration of the brain. In addition to that, this ingredient helps by providing an ample amount of nutritious blood to the brain, which is important for the proper functioning of the brain, memory, as well as other brain functions. It produces a chemical that helps in maintaining brain function and memory effectively. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**Order ProMind Complex Right Here At The Best Prices.!!**](https://promind-complex.healthgrowbeauty.com/order-now)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Benefits of ProMind Complex:**\n\nProMind Complex reviews have shown that the users have observed mental clarity and improved focus with few doses.

Smoker: No. Medical issues: Depression, anxiety, panicattacks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHey Docs, \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have been suffering from depression for almost 2 years, with everyday anxiety and panic attacks.  I'm now going on daily doses of 100mg Sertraline (Zoloft) and 50mg of  hydroxyzine dihydrochloride.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI’ve been thinking about combining some type of nootropics with SSRI (Sertraline specifically), and haven’t found much info about this. I’ve been trying to research this matter as much as I can, and what I’ve found so far is that there might be an interaction. But it would be pretty insignificant depending om the dosage of certain substances.\n\nFor example I know that L-theanin ”sets free” Seratonin and Dopamine. While this is a similar effect to SSRI, SSRI lacks the Dopamine effect.\n\nSo I was thinking about what the effects of these could be together. \n\nI found MADMONQ nootropic especially interesting, since I'm having a hard time focusing on simple tasks. \n\nThe substances found in this specific Nootropic are the following: \n\n Eleutherococcus senticosus extract, Rhodiola rosea extract, Bacopa monnieri extract, Caffeine, L-Tyrosine, L-Theanine, Acetyl-L-Carnitine, Vaccinium myrtillus extract,  Raspberry flavour, colours: beetroot red, iron oxides and hydroxides; stabilizer: Magnesium stearate; acidity regulator: malic acid; Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12), Zinc citrate, Pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6); sweeteners: xylitol (found commonly in birch trees), sorbitol (found commonly in pears),  sucralose \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have not yet found any studies on these substances interfering with any SSRI, although I have read some personal posts from people that have experienced issues with Rhodiola Rosea extract. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe dosage of the ingredients are as follows: \n\nAcetyl-L-Carnitine 50mg\n\nL-Theanine 52.5mg\n\nL-Tyrosine 130mg\n\nSiberian Ginseng Root ( Eleutherococcus senticosus )  1000mg\n\nBrahmi leaf extract (Bacopa monnieri) 21.2mg (20% Bacosides) \n\nRhodioa rosea 10mg (4% Rosavins) 10mg\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have any tips or information about this, I would really appreciate if you could take the time and bring me up to speed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

    "body": "Thanks for being so patient with your responses, this is my first time using Reddit and appreciate any insight someone can provide regarding my situation.\n\nI was diagnosed with ADHD at a young age. I was always extremely curious, thinking outside the box, learning new things, jumping from hobby to hobby. I learned tons of new things and accomplished nothing significant. My classes were all extremely hard because I had no interest until I discovered studying Chinese in my college career that made learning fun, and gave me something to distract my mind with all over again.\n\nI'm now 28 and things are catching up with me. Without any solid momentum besides a small Amazon business, I've run myself into a place where I know that my work needs to be done and my visions are big. I greatly think that I can improve my life with immense focus and clarity.\n\nI'd like to add: I did take Adderall at one point in my college career. My entire life was lit up in that instance. I felt like someone had plugged in the proper neurological pathways in my brain and everything I needed to do and accomplish that day was extremely easy and I was insanely motivated to accomplish them. I finally understood why Adderall was so beneficial for people lacking focus.\n\nSince then, I've tumbled bumbled left and right. Tons of ideas and nearly no action. I can sit for hours looking at my screen and come up with a 1,000+ more excellent ideas that may never be actualized.\n\nSome general background info about me (male, 28)\n-Lots of sunshine\n-Generally optimistic\n-Prone to depression\n-Eat Healthly (wild game, venison, organic vegetables grown from our garden, live on a farm)\n-Supplements - Super Green Food smoothie every morning - Contains (Matcha, Maca, First Green Pro superfood, fruit, creatine, and spirulina chlorella)\n-No fluoride toothepaste (Estrella)\n-Sauna 2-3 x a week\n-Weightlifting 3x a week\n-Meditation 7x a week (every morning and night)\n-Walk through nature 3-4x a week\n\nMy energy level generally seems fine. There is always just a large amount of mental unfocused and lack of motivation. Mentally, I can construct excellent ideas but they are never brought into fruition. \n\nWith all that being said, I'm looking for the clarity, focus, and motivation that Adderall gave me. I was less effected by what others said around me and my sheer willpower to destroy my mental barriers increased. Like I said before, I felt as if my brain was all cylinders a go. Fully operational. I want to somehow create a similar effect that can be used daily to greatly increase motivation, focus, and clarity.\n\nNew Stacks that I've tried Recently:\n\n1) Limidax XR\n-Niacin (20mg)\n-Nettle Leaf extract (33mg)\n-Vinpocetine (33 mg)\n-Yohimbe Extract (33 mg)\n-Microencapsulated Caffeine (300mg)\n-microencapsulated Phenethylamine HCL (300mg)\n-Synephrine Caprylate (75 mg)\n-Green Tea Extract (75 mg)\n\n2.)Neuro-Peak (Zhou Nutrition)\n-Vitamin B12 (500mcg)\n-Bacopa Monnieri Extract (300mg)\n-Phosphatidylserine (100mg)\n-Gingko Biloba (100mg)\n-Rhodiola Rosea Extract(50mg)\n-DMAE (50mg)\n\nSo here's what I've been taking for the last couple days. I can say that I have noticed a slight difference. I became more talkative and it elevated my mood. I did take some action, but I wasn't insanely motivated. I would say that it was a slight to mild increase in focus and clarity. However, I feel that it lacks the stimulation, motivation, and sheer focus that Adderall does.\n\nThing to add: I am motivated by my goals. However, I can be thinking one thing one second and then poof its gone and I've traveled down another rabbit hole that took me away from my first thought that would achieve the things I wanted to do, and I feel like this pattern is never ending in my life as I have lived with it all my life. I like my ideas and my creativity, I just can't seem to have the willpower and focus to actualize them.\n\nI've researched a couple other things such as:\n\n-Phenibut\n-Flmodafinil (CRL-40,940)\n-Kratom\n-Racetams\n\nFinally, My questions are:\n\nWould any of these be beneficial to add to my concentration stack? Would it be unsafe to mix any of these with my stack?\nWould any of these increase motivation with my stack?\nWould any of these add stimulant effect to my stack?\n\nOf course, I've read tons of blogs and posts about replicating Adderall effects. I'm just hoping someone can relate to my situation and shed some helpful insight.\n\nI am seeking to create a stack that has the \"sit down shut up and do WORK\" effect. That's really what I need in order to organize the thought floating around in my brain.\n\nAny other additional info and insight is much appreciated, and thank you for being so patient with my noobiness.\n",

I don't always have the time or the energy to brew a cup at night, but would like to reap chamomile's benefits daily.\n* 50 mg apigenin (derived from grapefruit); based on the cursory research I've done via Examine.com and reading through a handful of studies found on Google Scholar, apigenin has potential to be hugely beneficial to overall health and is quite likely to be the main relaxing/anti-anxiety flavonoid within chamomile. If you didn't notice from my current daily stack, I aim to reduce the generalized anxiety that I experience day-to-day, and am willing to give damn near anything a try. Even though the above-mentioned chamomile extract is standardized to 1% apigenin, that is still only 5 mg per dose; I would like to experiment with doses in the 200-300 mg range to see if it could effectively relieve my anxiety without being overly-sedating.\n* 820 mg of [Planetary Herbal's \"Stone Free.\"](https://www.swansonvitamins.com/planetary-herbals-stone-free-820-mg-180-tabs?otherSize=PF081) I have never had a kidney stone and have no reason to believe that I am at any particular risk for it, but kidney stones are one of my worst bodily fears, and it can't hurt to support the health of my kidneys and gall bladder anyway (in the same vein of logic as to why I take milk thistle).\n\n**The Real Question**\n\nIs there any reason that I should not be combining any of these supplements, or taking any of them daily? My current daily stack is fairly common, I believe, and I haven't had a single problem taking that for months. In fact, I would never want to go back to *not* taking my daily stack, as it has noticeably improved my quality of life. Mostly, what I'm curious about is adding the 4 supplements at the bottom of the list. These 4 supplements are not often mentioned on here or /r/Nootropics, so I have almost nothing to go off of in terms of potential interactions or side effects from daily and/or long-term use.\n\nEdit: if it matters, I'm a smoker (about a pack every day or two, depending on stress & recreational drug use), I sometimes take half of a men's multivitamin on days when I know my diet is nutritionally lacking, and I'm getting ready to start a daily 10 mg dose of noopept to see how that affects me. My recreational drug use includes amphetamine and xanax (unprescribed) both recreationally and  for their intended purposes, oxycodone on very rare & special occasions, infrequent social alcohol use (I pretty much left my binge drinking days behind when I graduated college), and up until recently, daily cannabis use. Currently I'm taking a break from cannabis because I've realized that I need to give my brain a break after 5 years of near-daily use, plus it most definitely sucks out all of my motivation (and dries up my wallet). I also try to have at least one cup of tea a day, which is usually either some variety of chamomile or green tea. I know that adding apigenin and chamomile extract to my list of supps may seem redundant if I often drink chamomile tea, but due to its laundry list of potential benefits, I see no harm in adding a little bit more every day or two.

Both build up a tolerance over the long term, and as ashwagandha works with similar efficacy and through the same mechanism of action as Valium (a benzodiazepine), withdrawals can be rough and leave you with a hypofunctioning GABAergic system, leaving you with worse anxiety that you started with. I used Ashwaghanda daily for several months and have experienced this effect. Glycine, taurine, L lysine, holy basil and Sarcosine are all alternative anxiolytics that do not build up a similar tolerance. Holy basil would even replicate the testosterone boosting effects of Ashwaghanda.",

This non-alcoholic, herbal supplement contains a blend of Ginkgo Biloba, Royal Jelly, and Ginseng — a powerful combination that has greatly enhanced my daily performance.\n\nGinkgo Biloba, in particular, has been a game-changer for me. As a busy professional, I often find myself running on limited sleep, but after incorporating this supplement into my routine, I've experienced a boost in mental clarity and focus. Additionally, I've noticed reduced inflammation and improved circulation throughout my body.\n\nRoyal Jelly is another key ingredient in this formula that has helped me maintain optimal health. Rich in B-vitamins and amino acids, it supports my immune system and enhances my physical performance, making it easier for me to juggle the demands of work and other responsibilities.\n\nFinally, the inclusion of Ginseng in this endurance formula provides a natural source of energy that lasts throughout the day. Consistently taking this supplement has enabled me to tackle tasks with renewed vigor and enthusiasm, without relying on caffeine or other stimulants to get me through the day.\n\nHowever, I must admit that the taste of this oral liquid can be somewhat unappealing at first. But after using it for a few days, I grew accustomed to its unique flavor profile and now enjoy the invigorating effects it provides.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're looking for a natural way to enhance your energy and endurance, I highly recommend giving Prince of Peace Ultra Ginkgo Plus Endurance Formula a try. With consistent use, you'll experience the benefits of improved mental clarity, reduced inflammation, and sustained energy levels that can help you tackle any challenge that comes your way.\n\n### [🔗Nature's Sunshine Ginkgo & Hawthorn Capsules](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/ginkgo-herbal-supplements?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=piggyback&utm_campaign=reddit&utm_content=ginkgo-herbal-supplements&utm_term=natures-sunshine-ginkgo-hawthorn-capsules)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vi6p1nfg626d1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de43954007d21b3b18128c398c2f92569457934f\n\nI’ve been using Nature's Sunshine Ginkgo & HawthornCombo for quite a while now, and I must say, it's been quite a journey. I can personally vouch for its effectiveness in improving circulation throughout the body and supporting blood flow to the extremities. The combination of Ginkgo Biloba leaf and Hawthorn Berry really packs a punch in terms of their circulatory support properties.\n\nOne thing that really stands out to me about this product is how it's made my heart healthier and my overall cardiovascular system stronger. It's like giving my body a natural boost that helps me maintain optimal health. Plus, it's reassuring to know that by using this supplement, I'm lowering my risk of developing heart diseases and other related factors.\n\nHowever, there are some cons to note as well. One issue I had was with the capsules themselves - they can be quite large and difficult to swallow, especially for those who are not used to taking supplements. Additionally, some users may experience side effects such as headaches or dizziness when starting this product, so it's important to start with a lower dose and gradually increase as needed.\n\nOverall, I believe that Nature's Sunshine Ginkgo & HawthornCombo is an excellent choice for anyone looking to improve their circulatory health and support their heart. Its potent combination of Ginkgo Biloba leaf and Hawthorn Berry truly makes a difference in helping me maintain my cardiovascular health.\n\n### [🔗Nature's Truth Ginkgo Biloba Capsules with Bacopa Monnieri Extract](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/ginkgo-herbal-supplements?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=piggyback&utm_campaign=reddit&utm_content=ginkgo-herbal-supplements&utm_term=natures-truth-ginkgo-biloba-capsules-with-bacopa-monnieri-extract)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3vo39d1h626d1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4a303edf0b48d78219c571b5d8c66a3de7096d0\n\nI am truly impressed with Nature's Truth Ginkgo Biloba and Bacopa Extract supplement.

The combination of Ginkgo Biloba and Bacopa Extract is a game-changer for anyone looking to enhance their cognitive function and memory.\n\nOne of the key features that I love about this product is its high potency. With 120 mg of Ginkgo Biloba and 40 mg of Bacopa Extract per capsule, I feel confident that I am getting the right amount of these powerful herbs to support my brain health. Plus, it's gluten-free and created without any artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners, or preservatives, making it a perfect choice for those who prioritize natural and wholesome ingredients.\n\nHowever, I must admit that the capsules are relatively large and can be difficult to swallow for some people. They do not have any unpleasant aftertaste, which is a big plus, but it would be great if the company could consider creating smaller capsules in the future.\n\nAll in all, I am extremely satisfied with Nature's Truth Ginkgo Biloba and Bacopa Extract supplement. It has helped me improve my cognitive performance and mental alertness, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to enhance their brain health naturally. Give it a try, and you won't be disappointed!\n\n### [🔗BioActivo Ginkgo Biloba 100mg Supplement for Blood Circulation](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/ginkgo-herbal-supplements?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=piggyback&utm_campaign=reddit&utm_content=ginkgo-herbal-supplements&utm_term=bioactivo-ginkgo-biloba-100mg-supplement-for-blood-circulation)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a701jmdh626d1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=446eea1dbef8896238d068ba7a0d0282d351a7a9\n\nI've been using BioActivo Biloba Strong for the past few weeks, and I must say, it's been quite a game-changer for my overall health.

But after a little research and some trial and error, I've come to really appreciate what this whole food brain health supplement has to offer. The combination of Ginkgo biloba and grapeseed extract is quite unique and provides a nice boost of mental clarity.\n\nOne thing that really stands out about Ginkgo Synergy is how it supports blood flow to the brain. I've noticed that my thinking feels clearer and more focused since starting this supplement. And the fact that it's made by Standard Process, a company dedicated to providing high-quality whole food nutrient solutions, only adds to my confidence in its effectiveness.\n\nHowever, one downside to Ginkgo Synergy is that it does have a somewhat strong taste. It's not unbearable, but I've definitely noticed it. Additionally, being a product that needs to be stored properly, I wish there was a more convenient option available for those of us who don't have a lot of space to spare.\n\nOverall, Ginkgo Synergy has made a positive impact on my mental clarity and general brain health. While its taste and storage requirements could be improved, I believe it's definitely worth trying out for anyone looking to support their cognitive function.\n\n### [🔗Herb Pharm Ginkgo Whole Leaf Liquid Extract](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/ginkgo-herbal-supplements?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=piggyback&utm_campaign=reddit&utm_content=ginkgo-herbal-supplements&utm_term=herb-pharm-ginkgo-whole-leaf-liquid-extract)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zsu3a39i626d1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=548cad1960226a5f0d8026fc016c5bce24bdfa23\n\nHerb Pharm's Ginkgo Liquid Extract comes from whole, green leaves of organic Ginkgo biloba trees, ensuring the utmost freshness and potency. I personally appreciated how it's extracted with organic cane alcohol to maintain the balance of beneficial compounds. It blends seamlessly into water or juice, making it a breeze to take daily.\n\nThe standout feature for me was how effective it was in enhancing my mental clarity and overall mood. I particularly noticed this when I would take it during periods of high stress and mentally demanding tasks, where it kept me focused and calm. Additionally, I appreciated its gluten-free nature, as I have some dietary restrictions.\n\nHowever, one downside I experienced was the taste. While it's not horrible, it does have a distinctive, somewhat bitter taste that might not be palatable for everyone. The taste can be masked by mixing it with a stronger flavored juice or smoothie, but it's worth noting for those sensitive to taste.\n\nIn conclusion, Herb Pharm's Ginkgo Liquid Extract has been a game-changer for me in terms of improving my mental clarity and overall mood. Its potency, freshness, and ease of use make it a top choice for anyone looking to boost their brain power.

This dietary supplement contains ginkgo biloba, traditionally used to support cognitive function, memory, and concentration - something I definitely need as a busy working professional.\n\nWhat really stood out for me was the combination of natural antioxidants in this product. I feel like these antioxidants are giving my brain cells an extra layer of protection against oxidative stress. Plus, the added Vinpocetine is supposed to improve blood flow to the brain, which can help support optimal functioning of the nervous system.\n\nOne thing I noticed is that this product is made from high-quality natural ingredients with no artificial additives or preservatives. It gives me peace of mind knowing that what I'm putting into my body is clean and pure.\n\nHowever, one downside is that you have to take the capsules quite frequently - twice to three times a day with food and water. This means one bottle only lasts me about 10-15 days. So, if you're considering buying this, make sure to keep in mind the quantity of capsules and how long they'll last you.\n\nOverall, I'm quite happy with Swanson Ginkgo with Vinpocetine. It's helped me stay sharp and focused during work, and I feel more mentally alert than before.

    "body": "Cognitive function plays a pivotal role in our ability to learn, remember, and make decisions. However, modern life is rife with challenges that hinder cognitive growth and development. This article explores the intricate factors influencing cognitive function, the undeniable importance of education, and the limitations that prevent many from achieving their intellectual potential.\n\n[The Secret of Cognitive Function.](https://preview.redd.it/mrcesxytor1e1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=874fee21e425d4e1232dd97a3b2b933f401c871e)\n\n# The Role of Education in Cognitive Health\n\nEducation is one of the most significant determinants of cognitive function. Studies have consistently shown that a higher level of education is associated with a reduced risk of cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. For each year of formal education, the risk of dementia drops by approximately 7%. Continuous learning fosters neural connections and keeps the brain resilient against age-related cognitive challenges.\n\nBut education's impact goes beyond formal schooling. Lifelong learning, whether through professional development, hobbies, or personal study, contributes significantly to maintaining cognitive health. Conversely, barriers such as limited access to quality education, economic hardships, or social inequalities often leave individuals unable to reach their cognitive potential. Addressing these systemic issues is essential for creating a society where intellectual growth is universally accessible.\n\n# Factors Hindering Cognitive Function\n\nDespite the benefits of education, several factors can negatively impact cognitive development:\n\n1. **Energy Deficiency**: Proper blood flow and energy supply to the brain are crucial. Simple practices to stimulate energy, though often dismissed as pseudoscience, highlight the need for awareness of brain health.\n2. **Limited Learning Capacity**: Individual differences in learning speed and memory retention can hinder education. While strategies like structured repetition and prioritizing learning [during peak mental performance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Energy_Health/comments/1gieeys/mental_clarity_support_top_brain_health/) can help, these adaptations require discipline and support.\n3. **Inaccessibility of Education**: Many are unable to pursue education due to financial, geographical, or systemic barriers. This limitation not only affects individuals but also stifles the collective progress of society.\n\n# Addressing the Challenges\n\nImproving cognitive function isn't just a medical challenge but a social one. While medical interventions can address specific cognitive impairments, broader issues like superstition, systemic inequalities, and lack of resources require societal solutions. Embracing the concept of lifelong learning and fostering environments that encourage intellectual curiosity can have profound effects on cognitive health.\n\nHerbal cognitive enhancers, as part of a holistic approach to brain health, are gaining attention for their potential to support memory and learning. While these supplements are not substitutes for addressing systemic barriers, they can complement efforts to maintain and improve cognitive function.\n\nIn the following articles, we will delve deeper into medical and natural interventions that support cognitive health. Stay tuned to explore actionable strategies and the role of emerging herbal remedies in enhancing brain function.

After reading reviews, in particular a review from /u/MisterYouAreSoDumb I noticed that users reported an increase in deep sleep time. \n\nFor those unaware Nootropics Depot sleep formula includes: \n\n* Lemon Balm 10:1 Extract 500mg\n* Bacopa monnieri Extract 200mg \n* Uridine Monophosphate 200mg\n* Magnolia Bark Extract 100mg\n* Oleamide 100mg \n* PrimaVie Shilajit 100mg \n\nhttps://nootropicsdepot.com/sleep-support-capsules-natural-sleep-aid/\n\nI'm wondering what I should stack in the morning to make the best use of this sleep stack (which I'll take at night, obviously) as I do suffer from brain fog and general low motivation in the mornings. I am open to suggestions but would at a minimum like to maintain the following in the morning:\n\n* Vitamin D 6000iu\n* Vitamin K2 120mcg\n* DHA 525mg\n\nI'm looking for a minimal morning stack (maybe adding 1-3 to the above). \n\nI will highlight I am more serotonin dominant due to actively taking an SSRI (escitalopram), which obviously leads to some of the lack of motivation, focus, and lack of dopamine I feel notably in the mornings. (Disclosure: I have experimented with all the nootropics in the poll below and have not had a negative interaction with escitalopram)\n\n**Here is a full list of nootropics at my disposal in the Poll below:**\n\nhttps://www.strawpoll.me/42355630",

        "body": "That’s an odd stack for sleep. I take take 3 of those before needing to WAKE UP before doing any public speaking and needing calm and focused energy with verbal recall: Uradine, Bacopa, and lemon balm; in addition to CDP Choline (Citicholine) and artichoke extract — this is the basis for the LiveCortex Gen1 Workhourse stack by Ryan Ballow that he promotes (it’s a great stack).\n\nBack to your Q... I would take Uridine in the morning along with CDP Choline as well. Both dopaminergic. But to really boost motivation Tyrosine or more potently, NALT + b6 would do it. However don’t do such for “too many weeks” without eventually incorporating 5-HTP to “balance out the equation” since they tend to work inversely proportional (or at least taking a lot of 1 tends to rev up something called AADC).\n\nAnyway, brain fog is due to Brian inflammation. Leaky gut generally means “leaky brain”, that is, inflammatory items crossing the BBB. I would leverage turmeric extract and CBD for brain fog acutely,  but fix the underlying condition chronically. Meaning you will have to make dietary changes. I’d recommend going paleo for 30 to 60 days and then reintroduce food. Lmk if you need resources for this (don’t want to make it seem like I’m advertising anything without first being asked). In general a really basic whole foods approach to things like raw carrots, grass fed beef, organic Turkey, and organic olive oil and lemon juice. Stuff like that.\n\nI find supplements tend to only work long term when you become more pure and less bogged down by incorrect foods, or lifestyle stress. And speaking of stress, a good adaptogen would be valuable if taken daily, like a small amount of ashwaghonda (FYI — smaller = better with adaptogenic herbs for energy & motivation; whereas larger = more relaxed or sleepier since they will drop down your cortisol levels significantly with larger and more dynamic doses... sometimes not always a bad thing)\n\nCircling back to sleep stack: I would look into organic cat nip, hops, and Kava kava, along with some Chamomile and Passionflower tea.\n\nLastly in addition to what I mentioned above and regarding your poll, I voted for tongkat and ginseng since they will boost libido and this motivation (not sure the biochemical reaction of that but I know testosterone does act as a reuptake inhibitor so that neurotransmitters hang around longer). However sadly missing is ALCAR - Acytl-L-Carnitine — this is like a mitochondrial, brain, and hippocampus norepinephrine booster AIO. Check it out 👍🏼 (smells and taste horrible so get it encapsulated)",

One question I have is if you're taking any medications right now aside from your stack?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs far as motivation /  focus goes;\n\nStart with NALT, then bump up to Mucuna Pruriens (L-Dopa)\n\nPine Bark Extract (oligomeric proanthocyanidins) show some promise in ADHD but more studies are needed.   \n\n\nFor brain fog;\n\nMagnesium L-Threonate (Magtein -- expensive but readily crosses the Blood Brain Barrier)\n\nn-acetylcysteine for anti-inflammation (Start with 1000-1,200MG dose), Rhodiola Rosea  \n\n\nCoQ10  \n\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n\n\nNow when someone says they have focus, or motivation issues I wonder if they might have ADHD. It's worth seeing if you do or not, because Stimulants are the best treatment for ADHD symptoms.   \n\n\n Ask yourself these questions;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you often...\n\n1: Get Easily distracted by extraneous stimuli, or irrelevant thoughts?\n\n2: Make decisions impulsively?\n\n3: Have difficulty stopping activities or behaviour when you should do so?\n\n4: Start a project or a task without reading or listening to directions carefully?\n\n5: Fail to follow through on promises or commitments you make to others?\n\n6: Have trouble doing things in their proper order or sequence?\n\n7: Drive much faster than others - - or if you don't drive, have difficulty engaging in leisure activities, or doing fun things quietly?\n\n8: Have difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or recreational activities?\n\n9: Have difficulty organizing tasks and activities?  \n\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIf you answered \"Yes,\" to most of these questions it's highly probable that you have adult-ADHD. I answered \"Yes,\" to all questions myself. \n\nThis is perception of symptom severity, so people without severe symptoms are far less likely to report \"Yes\" to these questions.\n\nThis is a good barometer for whether or not you should ask your doctor for a Psychiatric Referral, or if a Clinical Psychological Assessment is enough for them to prescribe Stimulants.",

These signals are then interpreted by the brain, which helps you process the sounds that you hear.\n\nThus, several processes take place to help you understand and interpret the sounds. Whenever there is a problem in this complex system, hearing problems may occur.\n\nThus, the [SonoVive](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewsForSonoVive) formula has been created to address these functions in the body. First, the ingredients reduce the damage causing inflammation, oxidative stress, and other factors that cause damage to the cells in the ears.\n\nNext, these ingredients also boost the functions of the neurotransmitters and the brain to send and receive signals effectively.\n\nThus, the SonoVive formula works at the roots and eliminates hearing problems effectively. When you consume SonoVive every day, it prevents inflammation from taking place and disturbing the neurons.\n\nIt also carries out detoxification of cells so nothing disturbs your brain and ear health at any age. Hence, you must take it daily for it to work well.\n\n[**Click Here to View the SonoVive Official Website for More Info**](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Ff14d4fc2n-eu0m7orlupjjkuea.hop.clickbank.net%2F%3Fcbpage%3Dtsl%26tid%3DREDD&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0_Y3kyNAlTv9nVw1i-bvwz)\n\n## What are the ingredients of SonoVive?\n\n* **John’s Wort:** This ingredient has been proven effective in reducing the risk of ear infections, tinnitus, and many other functions.

    "body": " \n\nHello.\n\nI have bought a bacopa monnieri extract pretty much on a whim, without really knowing anything about it. Now I wonder if the dosage is right. At first I thought it is too much (500g Bacopa Monnieri), but then I saw that the Bacoside-proportion is only 20% (so its only 100mg Bacoside)\n\nI have read that the perfect amount is 300g Bacopa Monnieri, but only for a Bacoside-proportion of 50%. (making it 150mg Bacoside) Does that mean, that my 100mg of Bacoside is not enough? Please help",

    "body": "I read an article that I found interesting, and I think it’s worth sharing. It sheds light on a common energy drink additive called taurine, which could be doing more harm than good. While the research is still in its early stages, it’s definitely something to keep an eye on. Either way, it’s a good reminder that what we put into our bodies truly matters especially when it comes to daily energy and focus.\n\nOne important thing to note: I’m not saying taurine is terrible— it can be beneficial in moderation. But when you see energy drinks loaded with up to 3,000 mg of taurine in a single serving, that’s when it becomes a red flag. More isn’t always better, especially when it’s paired with high levels of caffeine and other stimulants.\n\nThere are options out there that align with what your body is really asking for—nutrients that fuel resilience, without artificial stimulation, caffeine crashes, or jitters. \nHere are few nutrients to know: \n\nAlpha GPC\nA highly bioavailable form of choline that crosses the blood-brain barrier, Alpha GPC supports the production of acetylcholine—a key neurotransmitter responsible for memory, learning, and focus. It’s often used in cognitive enhancement and is even studied for age-related mental decline.\n\nATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)\nThe literal fuel of our cells, ATP is what your body uses for energy at the most foundational level. While many products try to “stimulate” energy, ATP supports it directly—powering everything from brain activity to physical performance without draining your system.\n\nTeaCrine® (Theacrine)\nThis powerful compound works synergistically with caffeine to boost mood, motivation, and focus—without the crash or tolerance build-up. Think of it as a cleaner, longer-lasting energy support that doesn’t spike cortisol or interfere with sleep.\n\nCaffeine Anhydrous\nUnlike the jittery energy some caffeine sources cause, this purified form provides a rapid mental and physical lift. When Caffeine Anhydrous is included, it can complement other ingredients to promote alertness without overload.\n\nBacognize® (Bacopa Monnieri extract)\nThis adaptogenic herb has been clinically studied for its ability to support memory, learning speed, and stress resilience. It enhances synaptic communication—helping the brain process and retain information more efficiently.\n\nRhodiola Rosea\nUsed for centuries in traditional medicine, this adaptogen helps the body respond to stress more efficiently. It reduces fatigue, supports mood balance, and is known to improve endurance and cognitive stamina during demanding tasks.\n\nL-Tyrosine\nAn amino acid that acts as a precursor to dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine—your brain’s “get stuff done” chemicals. It’s especially beneficial in times of stress or sleep deprivation, helping preserve mental performance when you need it most.\n\nGlycine\nA calming neurotransmitter that promotes mental clarity and emotional balance. It plays a key role in regulating the nervous system, supporting restful sleep, and protecting the brain from overstimulation.\n\nLonicera Berry\nRich in C3G (Cyanidin-3-glucoside) and potent antioxidants, this berry helps protect brain cells from oxidative stress and supports healthy inflammation levels—promoting clean, sustained energy without the crash.\n\nMaqui Berry\nOne of the most antioxidant-dense superfruits on the planet, Maqui Berry supports clarity and cognitive health by combating free radicals and oxidative stress, which can slow brain performance and contribute to fatigue.\n\nVitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid)\nEssential for the synthesis of coenzyme A and the production of neurotransmitters like acetylcholine. It plays a central role in converting the food you eat into usable energy—especially important for brain function and stress response.\n\nWhen you start learning what these ingredients actually do, it changes the way you look at every label. You begin to see that real energy and focus don’t have to come at the expense of your long-term health.\n\n",
