They also allow for easier bonding to many organic materials, like textiles, making them dyes rather than pigments. \n\nNitro-aromatic compounds, especially with as many as three connected to one ring, also happen to be quite unstable, though stable enough to carry around without an accident - or use as a dye. \n\nHence the duality of TNT.",

    "body": "Naisipan kong dumaan sa Watsons ngayong araw para bumili ng lotion, dahil paubos na yung ginagamit ko. Nakita ko tong lotion na 'to ng Luxe Organix na naka B1T1 for Php 405, kaya naisipan kong subukan. 2 variant yung binili ko, itong Retinol + Gluta, tsaka yung Niacinamide + Arbutin. \n\nTLDR:\n\nMay microfoaming, malakas ang fragrance, heavier skin feel kumpara sa ibang serum lotions sa Market, mali-mali ang IL, mislabeled dahil imbes na retinol, Retinyl Palmitate ang laman base sa IL. \n\nUnahin muna nating tingnan ang packaging. Sa unang tingin, di nalalayo material sa packaging ng mga serum lotion ng Vaseline. Tho, yung sa Vaseline, rounded yung tabas ng seal ng tube sa both sides, samantalang itong sa LO ay pointed. \n\nSa itsura naman mismo ng laman, off-white na medyo madilaw yung kulay ng lotion. Medyo clumpy din yung itsura pagkalabas nito sa tube, at madali ding mag-break yung emulsion upon skin contact. Malakas yung fragrance nya na dominated ng floral notes. Unang naisip ko nga nung naamoy ko e amoy poon, dahil sa sobrang floral. \n\nMedyo matagal ipahid sa balat, kumpara sa ibang serum lotion na nasubukan ko na. Naka-observe din ako ng microfoaming during application nitong lotion. Ang microfoaming ito yung nagkakaroon ng puti-puting streaks sa balat habang pinapahid ang isang product, kadalasan mga emulsion gaya ng lotion at creams. Ang microfoaming ay dulot ng pagkaka-trap ng air sa product habang ipinapahid sa balat. Kung ikukumpara ko ito sa ibang serum lotion na nagamit ko na (Vaseline Gluta-Hya Serum Burst Lotion, Smoochkins Nia-Arbutin Nano White Serum Lotion), ito yung pinaka heavy ang skin feel. Hindi ko masyadong na-feel yung pagka serum lotion. And lastly naka-experience din ako ng pamumula at pantal sa braso ko after ko gamitin itong lotion na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list. \n\nWater (Aqua), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Myristate, Fragrance, C15-19 Alkane, Stearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Triethanolamine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Glutathione, Polysorbate 20, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ceramide NP, Mannitol, Pentylene Glycol, CI19140, Phosphatidylcholine, Retinyl Palmitate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Polyglyceryl-10,  Citric Acid, Tocopherol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nHindi na talaga nawala ang mga errors sa IL ng mga local products. Di yata talaga uso ipa-check man lang sa regulatory personnel ang IL na ilalagay sa final layout ng packaging bago ang ipa-mass printing. Para sa product na ito, hindi Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol ang tamang INCI name, kung hindi Cetearyl Alcohol. Next, Polyglyceryl-10, what? Incomplete yung ingredient name. Ang daming Polyglyceryl-10 esters na nag eexist, wag nyo na kami paghulain. (Side Note: Ang Polyglyceryl-10 esters ay kadalasang ginagamit as non-ionic emulsifier sa cosmetics.). \n\nPangalawa kong napansin, CI19140. Ang CI19140 ay isang dye na kilala din bilang Tartrazine Yellow or FD&C Yellow #5. Ito yung nagbigay ng medyo madilaw na kulay sa lotion na ito. Konektado ito sa kasunod kong punto. \n\nIkatlo, bakit Retinyl Palmitate ang nakalista dito sa IL? Kaya nyo ba nilagyan ng Yellow #5 ang lotion na ito para magmukhang may retinol, kasi nakakapagdulot ng paninilaw sa mga product ang retinol kapag ihinalo ito? Ngayon, ano ba ang problema kung retinyl palmitate ang nakalagay, imbes na retinol? Ito kasi yun: maliban sa obvious na mislabelling sa product na ito, mas mababa ang potency ng retinyl palmitate kaysa sa retinol. Sa buong retinoid family, ang mga retinyl esters kagaya ng retinyl palmitate ang may pinakamababang potency, dahil kailangan pa nito ng isang extra conversion step (retinyl palmitate -> retinol). Tandaan, ang mga retinoids, kailangang ma-convert into retinoic acid para ma-activate ang retinoic acid receptors natin sa balat at makuha ang benefits. \n\nRetinyl esters -> Retinol -> Retinaldehyde -> Retinoic Acid\n\nKada conversion step, bumababa ang potency ng isang retinoid, kaya sa kaso ng retinyl palmitate, na isang retinyl ester, eto ang may pinakamababang potency. \n\nMay peptides din pala itong lotion na ito: Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9 at Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11.\n\nAng acetyl tetrapeptide-9 ay isang signaling peptide na nagbibigay ng message sa fibroblasts sa ating dermis na magproduce ng collagen (specifically Collagen Type 1) at proteoglycans, na mahalaga para mapanatili ang structure at mapanatiling tight (hindi sagging) ang balat natin.  Nakakatulong din itong mabawasan ang appearance ng fine lines sa mukha, dahil na rin sa stimulation ng collagen at proteoglycan production. \n\nKung ang dermis ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, ang epidermis naman ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-11. Kagaya ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, signaling peptide din ito na nagbibigay ng mensahe sa epidermis na mag-synthesize o magproduce ng Syndecan-1 at Collagen XVII. Kapag mataas ang dalawang ito sa balat, nag-iimprove ang elasticity ng balat. \n\nKaramihan ng mga nabanggit na benepisyo ng dalawang peptides na ito ay base pa lamang sa mga in-vitro studies na naisagawa na. Wala pang gaanong in-vivo clinical studies na lumabas kaya medyo skeptical pa din ako sa mga peptides na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo lastly sa product claims. \n\n* Retinol + Gluta\n\n* Whitening Serum Lotion\n\n* Lightening\n\n* Firming\n\n* Hydrating\n\n* 24 hr Supple Smooth\n\n* 3X Peptide Youth Repair + Hyaluronic Bright + Ceramide Glow\n\nUnang claim pa lang, sablay na. Wala namang retinol tong lotion na 'to. Pinaglololoko ako nitong LO e. \n\nSa claim na lightening at whitening, medyo duda ako. Mukhang glutathione lang ang pwedeng masabi ng brand na ito na skin lightening ingredient. Pero duda ako sa efficacy ng glutathione na makapagpa lighten ng skin topically. Maraming limitations yung mga published studies tungkol sa efficacy ng topically applied gluta, gaya ng mababang bilang ng participants sa studies at sobrang iksi na study period. \n\nSa claim na firming, mukhang inilagay ito gawa nung mga peptides. Sa hydrating claim, meron namang hydrating ingredients (glycerin, hyaluronic acid derivatives, olive oil, Plukenetia Volubilis oil, tsaka Ceramide NP). Same din dun sa mga sumunod na claims, dahil sa presence ng mga nabanggit na ingredients. \n\n\nFinal words:\n\nHindi ako masaya sa nabili kong lotion na 'to. Hindi kasing lightweight at fast absorbing nung iba kong nasubukan na serum lotions. Amoy poon yung fragrance. May microfoaming during application. Nagkapantal ako sa braso. Mali-mali ang IL. Pero yung pinaka disappointing sa lotion na 'to e yung claim na may retinol daw, pero retinyl palmitate lang ang nasa ingredient list. May paglalagay pa ng yellow dye para magmukhang may retinol. Napakalaking red flag para sa akin ang pagmi-mislabel ng product.\n\nAyun lang. Salamat sa pagbabasa. At laging maging mapanuri sa mga binibili at balak nating gamitin na products. \n\n",

Yellow dye appears to have been added to the lotion to give the appearance of fully evolved retinol being an ingredient as retinol usually makes creams look yellow.\n* The peptides used claim to target fine lines and elasticity, but only proven by in-vitro studies (i.e. in controlled lab environments) vs. in-vivo (i.e. on living organisms)\n\nThank you for this in-depth review, skincare\\_chemist19!

    "body": "Concept image [here](https://imgur.com/a/O4ipdes) (sorry for the poor quality, my photoshop expired)\n\nThe new nether update did a lot to make the new nether more interesting with many new biomes to explore. The problem is that there are all just as commonly found and there is no need to explore aside from areas around spawn to find the majority of things the nether has to offer. This is where the glowstone chasm comes into play as a biome with a much lower percentage chance of generating than the rest.\n\n**Biome overview.**\n\n* The biome is very similar to the crimson forest biome but with a yellow colour pallet\n* The key difference is that everything in the biome glows: the tress, nylium, and plants all emit light\n* The biome has no mobs aside from blazes (perfect for blaze hunting)\n* Glowstone clusters are twice as common in the biome\n\n**Flora and terrain**\n\n* Glistening nylium: behaves like normal nyluim but emits a light level of 5\n* Golden vines:  work the same way as twisting vines but can emit a light level of 10 and smelted into yellow dye.\n* glowing roots and sprouts: you probably already get the idea, they emit a light level of 5\n* Glowstone out-crops consisting of a pyramid of glowstone blocks will spawn on the ground\n* Huge glowing fungus trees will generate on the ground and occasionally grow from the walls\n\n**Special items**\n\n* Glowing wood: can be crafted from the glowing fungus tree stems, the wood will not emit a glow and will have a bright yellow color to it and the full set of customizations (stairs, slabs, doors etc)\n* Starlight fruit: It will have a 40% chance of generating on the side of a glowing fungus tree like a cocoa bean and when eaten will regenerate 2.5 hunger.\n* Potion of luminance: made from putting a starlight fruit into a brewing stand, it will make the player emit a 15 light level around themselves when walking. Works as a cheaper alternative for night vision.\n\nIf you liked it please vote for it on the feedback page [here](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360072510351-New-Nether-biome-Glowstone-chasm) and if you have criticisms leave them in the comments.

(like the eyes of Phantoms, Endermen, Spiders, etc.)\n\n* the potion of Luminance is a great idea, but what if it gave you the the same effect as spectral arrows do? or perhaps it does give the same effect as you suggested, but it works in levels, for example if you add glowstone dust to the potion it would emit a light level of 15, however if you don't do that, you only get a light level of 8 or something.",

I think it would have to be an entirely new design. My suggestion would be to keep it similar enough to the existing forests but make it upside down. Glow stone already generates on roofs so trees like it should too. \n\nAlso the potion idea would be largely redundant because of how many players just have optifine or something else fixing that problem.",

    "body": "As a fan of the Pickle in a Pouch line as well as Warheads, I’ve been slowly making my way through a 12 pack of these. \n\nBefore I get into the review, I had previously bought a couple of 12 packs of Van Holten’s non-blue raspberry Warhead pickles. Despite the package promising extreme sour, it tasted pretty much identical to Van Holten’s Sour or “Sour Sis” pickles in a pouch. I tried eating both kinds back to back and noticed virtually no difference. But I love them anyway. Despite the line being mostly a novelty I’ve always thought the pickle in a pouch line is pretty damn good and worth trying for any pickle fan.\n\nI doubted the Blue Raspberry pickle would be anything special. I genuinely thought it wouldnt even be Blue Raspberry flavored, I fully expected a normal sour Van Holten’s pickle with a little extra blue mixed in. Maybe at best there would be a little extra sugar mixed in.\n\nBut no: This is a blue raspberry pickle.\n\nFirst off, there is an insane amount of blue dye in there. If you’ve had Van Holten’s before, you might be aware of the amount of yellow dye in their juice but oh my god you can REALLY tell with the blue. My hands were blue, a tiny drop on a paper towel showed instantly, I had blue under my fingernails for several hours after. Think about like a messy ringpop situation in terms of the after effects on hands/mouth.\n\nSecond off, yes there is a blue raspberry flavor in it. It’s definitely muted and more of just an extra sweetness thats hard to describe. Its a completely different sweetness that what you would taste in bread and butter pickles (which I find inedible). I don’t think I would be able to identify it as a blue raspberry pickle in a blind taste test, but knowing I was eating a blue raspberry pickle, yes I can taste the flavor coming through. It’s honestly underheleming and that’s what makes it so hard to describe: there’s only so many ways you can call it underwhelming.\n\nIt was not disgusting I’ve eaten around 3 so far and will probably finish the pack anyway. It was not surprisingly good either. I’m not about to hand these out to my friends and family as a secret flavor combo they never knew they needed.\n\nAt best I can call this a novelty, at worst I can call this pointless.\n\nAs a novelty it delivers. Its a fun flavor without being disgusting. It’s something you could buy as a gag gift for a pickle lover or throw into a white elephant pile for the holidays. As a casual consumer product, I really don’t think there’s a point. Again, it’s edible and it’s still a sour pickle but I really prefer any of the other normal sour Van Holten’s flavors. It’s not even a case of eat 1 for every 12 normal ones to mix it up, it just doesn’t really do anything for me.\n\nThey’re a little hard to track down, I could only find them in 12 packs but if you come across one and are curious, I’d say try it once in your life just to see. Go in with minimal expectations, be slightly amused, and wash your hands really well after.",

    "body": "ETA: This is a really long post! Personally I love hearing other people's stories and having lengthy discussions. If you hate that and just want the summary, here's the TLDR first. These are nine of my personal favorite \"life hacks\"—tell us yours!\n\n1) A study found that people given lab coats performed better on tests: look smart, feel smart. Use this principle to stay motivated at home by dressing like a bitch who gets shit done instead of wearing sweatpants around the house. \n\n2) If you know how to sew, stick your sewing machine in your laundry room and just fix / hem / take in garments immediately after washing. Don't tell yourself that you'll get to a tailor eventually and then miss out on wearing your favorite pieces. Having the machine handy keeps your wardrobe fresh.\n\n3) Upgrade your shopping bags to totes with extra long, *padded* handles so you can comfortably throw all your groceries on one shoulder instead of hands or elbows.\n\n4) If your house has a lot of stairs, do yourself a favor and get a dedicated handheld vacuum. There's no reason to be dragging the upright or canister up the stairs every single time you vacuum them.\n\n5) Unless you're already a ceiling fan person, grab a cute desktop fan and bring it with you room to room. The breeze feels nicer than AC anyway and lets you stop blasting the entire house with frigid climate control. This switch saved me $130+ on my monthly electric bill.\n\n6) If your phone is constantly beeping with text notifications, but you can't silence it in case the text is from a boss or colleague, take 15 minutes to individually assign your work contacts a loud text notification, then put your general text notification as Silent. That way, when your phone beeps at work, you know you're supposed to look at it.\n\n7) If you're struggling to find the right eyeshadow shade for a glowy, minimal look, your favorite blush or bronzer might be it.\n\n8) This one probably doesn't apply if you have kids. Otherwise, don't wait till after dinner to put the leftovers into tupperware and refrigerate them. Put your serving onto your plate and immediately refrigerate any leftovers before you sit down to eat. Reduces the temptation to go back for seconds when you're already full.\n\n9) If you're someone who sleeps through alarms, try light instead of sound. Put a bright lamp on your nightstand and plug it into a wall-plug timer.\n\nAnd now for the insatiable readers and chatty bitches :)\n\n[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcheswithtaste/s/NaVymmtRh2) excellent recent post got me thinking about my personal life hacks: simple things I wish somebody had told me to start doing a decade ago that have made my life easier with minimal effort. Not all of mine are free, so they don't belong in the previous discussion, but they were all less than $100. Some of them are just a matter of changing my attitude.\n\nI want to hear not just your secret life hacks, but also the success stories behind them. It can be just as hard to start a good habit as it is to break a bad habit, and for me, it's so much easier when I can envision the end goal.\n\nEven if it seems way too obvious, please share anyway! Sometimes the answer to a problem is staring you in the face and you still can't see it.\n\nHere are the low-effort, high-reward tricks I wish I'd learned ages ago:\n\n*Motivated bitches with no dirty dishes*\n\nI used to come home, rip off my work clothes, ditch the bra, and slip into something super comfy—sweatpants, worn-out tee, ancient oversized hoodie, mismatched fuzzy socks. And then I'd maybe watch some TV, grumble my way through \"chores\" like dishes and laundry, lounge around, go to bed.\n\nOne day about six months ago, my husband (also wearing sweats) made the offhand comment that we must be slobs, because whenever our neighbors step outside to check the mail or something, they are at least wearing jeans and a properly fitting tee. I got to wondering whether we are the outliers and everyone else really is at home dressed like a sitcom character instead of walking around in pajamas.\n\nSo I tried it the other way, partially out of pure curiosity and partially because I couldn't get the word \"slob\" out of my head. I'd come home, take off my work clothes, and put on some nice jeans, cute top, maybe a necklace or bracelet.\n\nIs THIS how you unstoppable bitches have been doing it this whole time?! Wearing my nice jeans, I wouldn't dare crawl into bed for some Netflix, so I found myself wandering the house looking for something to do. Washing the dishes or vacuuming seemed easy and obvious. If I needed to run to the grocery store, I didn't dread it because I was already dressed for it.\n\nI feel like a completely different person just because I started dressing up as one. Turns out this is a real thing, it's called \"enrobed cognition,\" and I was the last one to get the memo.\n\n*Your own personal tailor... someone to mend your tears, hemmin' your flares*\n\nI used to ruin my life with clothing. While folding laundry, if I noticed something damaged or just thought to myself that it didn't suit me anymore, I'd hang it up in the back of the closet and promise to deal with it soon. Of course that never happened and I would find myself with a closet full of clothes and nothing to wear. So I'd impulse buy something new and the cycle continued.\n\nMeanwhile, my sewing machine sat in the closet, only to be pulled out if I want to make a garment for a special occasion or if I bought new curtains that need hemming.\n\nRecently I started tackling the project of decluttering my closet and curating my wardrobe, and I took out my sewing machine and set it up on the end of my laundry folding table. Now, if I find a pair of jeans with one of the belt loops ripped off, or a dress hem coming undone, I just toss in the correct color thread and fix it right then and there. Takes five minutes.\n\nIf the issue is more time consuming than that, like a pair of pants that fit better 10 pounds ago, or are a bit too long now that I'm in my ankle pants era, I put them in a designated basket next to the sewing machine and come back to them that weekend.\n\nMy clothes fit better, I feel more stylish and less wasteful, and I don't feel the need to buy new clothes because I actually enjoy wearing the ones already in my closet.\n\nApparently this is ALSO a thing—\"shopping your own closet\"—and once again, I missed the memo.\n\nBonus round on this one: I've also discovered how cheap and easy it is to dye clothing. Now that I know my best colors, I hate to wear anything that just makes me look blah. Why wear grey ever again when I could absolutely glow in cobalt?\n\nBut not everything comes in cobalt, coral, and emerald, and I already have otherwise flattering sweaters and dresses in colors that wash me out. Takes me half an hour with a big pot on the stove and a $6 bottle of Rit Dye to get the exact color I want.\n\nYou don't even have to start with white. Recently I bought a super cute sweater on clearance but it only came in pink. I wanted coral. Threw in a few drops of yellow dye, and now I've added a coral sweater to my Bright Spring capsule wardrobe!\n\n*One-trip wonder*\n\nGrocery shopping is a pain in my ass.\n\nBut I upgraded from my retro-stripe Aldi reusable grocery bags to a few sturdy canvas totes with extra long, ✨padded✨ handles. Now instead of carrying all my grocery bags in my hands or on my elbow, I can comfortably throw them all on my shoulder and still have both hands free for my keys or phone.\n\nIt also dawned on me that grocery totes don't have to be just literally for the grocery store. I bring them in on every shopping trip now, like at the hardware store or liquor store, and solve the same problem when I'm buying paint, wood glue, or car parts...\n\nSimple light bulb moment but it took me long enough.\n\n*Cleanliness and meowiness*\n\nWe have two cats. Constant vacuuming is not optional. I dread vacuuming the stairs, dragging my stupid upright vac with me—so of course the stairs seem to be where the cat hair accumulates fastest.\n\nI finally did myself a favor and spent $89 on one of those little handheld pet vacuums. Now I just do the stairs with that in 90 seconds every day and save the upright for everything else.\n\nAs a bonus, the handheld vac is perfect for detailing your car.\n\n*Some Hate it Hot*\n\nI have saved a fortune on electricity during this heat wave. I used to just blast the climate control throughout the whole house and get hit with a $300+ electric bill. Shame on me, I know.\n\nThis year I'm just bringing a 10-inch desktop fan with me from room to room. The breeze feels cooler than the AC anyway, and my electric bill is more like $170.\n\nWhen a fan isn't enough, I use the zone settings on the climate control and keeping it a few degrees warmer than I used to. In most of the house I don't run the AC at all, just in our bedroom and bathroom because we both can't sleep when it's hot.\n\n*Unbothered*\n\nI have to keep my phone on me at work in case my boss or colleagues call or text me, but it also looks unprofessional to be constantly checking my phone. I used to just silence my notifications so that I'm not looking at it every time it beeps, because the majority of beeps are from friends and family. Instead I'd glance at it every half hour or so to see if I have a work text.\n\nEvery once in a while I will check it and find out that somebody texted me about something relatively urgent and is now annoyed that I haven't replied for 20 minutes. Sure, they could have called, but is anybody still doing that in 2025?\n\nSo I finally set aside a few minutes and manually gave all my work contacts a loud text tone, then set everyone else on silent. Now I know for a fact that if my phone beeps, I'm supposed to look at it. And when I'm at home, I can reply to friends or family on my own time, when I want to look at my phone, instead of hearing a beep and feeling the pressure to respond instantly.\n\n*You're making me blush*\n\nI've wasted hundreds of dollars trying to find the perfect eyeshadow to achieve that minimal, glowy, barely-there natural makeup. Everything that works on other people seems to be too dark or too dull or too brown. I have spent hours Googling \"no makeup looks for fair skin\" and \"clear spring natural makeup palette\" just to find the same unflattering recommendations.\n\nRemember I said coral is one of my best colors? I've been barking up the wrong tree.\n\nPeachy-coral blush is my perfect eyeshadow, and it brings out the green in my eyes.\n\nIf you have a blush or bronzer that really makes you glow, it's probably also a candidate for a subtle smokey eye. You can skip the liner, dab it on with your fingers, and tone it down with your blender.\n\n*Lead us not into temptation*\n\nI used to cook dinner, put food on my plate, and leave the pan on the stovetop or in the oven. Then I'd wander back to the stove, take another little plateful, eat that, feel way too full, and waddle back to put the leftovers in the fridge.\n\nMy new and improved routine: if eating alone, like when my husband is working late, I mindfully put food on my plate with the intention of being satisfied but not stuffed, and immediately put all the rest into a tupperware and stick it in the fridge. Empty pan goes right into the dishwasher before I even sit down to eat. When he gets home, he can take it out of the fridge to reheat.\n\nIf we're eating together, I fix a plate for each of us and I know he will want seconds, so I leave exactly enough in the pan for his portion, then immediately tupperware and refrigerate the rest.\n\nIf it's not right there in my line of sight, still hot and way too convenient, it takes away my temptation to go back and keep grazing. I feel so much better in the evenings when I'm not feeling full and bloated after dinner.\n\nBonus on this one: breaking news, feeling full and bloated every evening is terrible for your sex life. The tupperware trick is also a relationship hack.\n\n*Get lit*\n\nI've always had to wake up at 5 am for work. I have also managed to sleep through a tornado touching down half a mile from my house, so you can imagine how easy it is for me to sleep through even the loudest alarm. So embarrassing.\n\nOn some trip years ago, I got on the plane and immediately fell asleep after takeoff like I always do, and then woke up instantly when they turned the cabin lights back on before landing. I realized I always wake up when the lights come on.\n\nSo I ditched the alarm clock and put a crazy bright lamp on my nightstand, then plugged it into a wall-plug timer. Never overslept my alarm again. Career blosssomed.\n\n...if you got through all of these, congratulations. I hope they inspire you to live your best life in good health and good taste.\n\nNow tell the rest of us bitches your own overnight success stories and lightbulb moments.",

I work from home most of the week and for a long time I would try to fit in eating with work and meetings. And I would end up gravitating to something fast and unhealthy. Now I make some hard boiled eggs and some veggies (spinach or peppers or whatever I have that needs cooking) a few times a week and it lasts a few days in the fridge. I eat this as a brunch and it keeps me full until about 4. Then I can grab a light snack to tide me over until dinner.

It’s quicker and easier for me to get ready, 2. I’ve vetted the outfit ahead of time, 3. Im spending less money on impulse purchases because I have everything I need with my completed outfits.\n\nSecondly, I purchased a little device called “brick” (I’d insert a link but can’t 😭). It basically locks any app of your choosing and you can’t undo it unless you have the device present and “unbrick” your phone. I’ll leave the brick upstairs or in the other room so I’m not tempted to open a distracting app. It will tell you how many hours your phone has been “bricked” and it’s motivating to keep you off your phone when you see it’s been 3 hours or so. Nothing is better than setting my phone to allow only texts or calls. Do not disturb isn’t enough for me and neither is the app limit on my iPhone because I can easily bypass it.

    "body": "Some background: I run a fairly popular tumblr blog that I made the mistake of creating a discord server for (the server isn't about the blog, it started out as an overwatch server that devolved into more of a general chat discord). There are over 100 people in the discord, but only around 15-20 active members, none of whom know each other in real life. I'm not in the discord often, because stuff like this (okay, not QUITE like this), happens way too often, but I check in on it occasionally.\n\nOur story starts with a new member joining the server. His discord nickname is \"genius Russian man\", but I'll be calling him Dmitri. His nickname slides by unnoticed, because we figure he's joking. Dmitri begins to be fairly active on the server, and strikes up a friendship with most of the server members. He's nice, and  speaks really good english. He also tells us he's really good at math and science, hence the discord nickname. He claims to have just turned eighteen.\n\nOne day, Dmitri tells us that he's managed to create a fully functional ai. Understandably, everyone tells him he's full of shit, and he responds with indignation that we would doubt his abilities, and creates a channel for his \"ai\" which is basically a discord bot that doesn't function all that well. Everyone thinks this is unintentionally hilarious, and lets him carry on. This isn't super relevant to the overall story arc, but I figured I'd include it to paint a picture of his character.\n\nThe second player in this story is another discord member named James. James has been active since pretty much the very beginning of the discord, and is universally liked. James is also a transgender man (female-to-male) who can't access testosterone due to being underage and his parents not consenting. \n\nDmitri tells James, pretty much out of the blue, that he's managed to synthesize testosterone. This isn't actually *impossible*, but certainly improbable for an eighteen year old, and requires getting ahold of some things in not-at-all legal ways. He tells James he would be willing to sell him some testosterone for $30, a pint of his blood, and **one of his eggs**.\n\nJames points out that removing eggs is a medical procedure, to which Dmitri insists ovulation \"pushes them to within grabbing range\". James then asks to see any proof of his managing to make testosterone, to which Dmitri sends him a piece of paper covered with hastily-handwritten equations, which end in a chemical formula that someone else in the discord server googles and finds out is not testosterone, but yellow dye. \n\nBy this point, everyone's pretty much had enough of his shit, Dmitri is banned, and an entire google docs document is drawn up documenting the reasons he was banned. He creates a new discord user and messages again telling us that we will soon regret our decision to ban him, and is banned again, less ceremoniously this time. He hasn't reappeared yet, and has become a discord inside joke, but I suspect we'll regret it when his fully-functional ai is unleashed upon the world.\n\ntl;dr: Guy tries to sell a transgender man yellow dye disguised as testosterone through my discord server in exchange for $30, a pint of his blood, and one of his eggs, is banned, probably training his ai to kill us right now.\n\n\n",

If you take away all ideas of the crafting tables recipes and reduce to only the ones in your inventory from spawning into the game you have far less which narrowed down my search. I then decided to look for early game thing you can get which took me to flowers, I found that dandelions are the most commonly spawned in Minecraft which you can break in an instant and open the inventory in an instant as well, I conclude that you could probably craft yellow dye (or any dye) in about 3 seconds depending on how fast you find the flower, if this isn't a speed run category, it should be. I want to know if you can beat the time I think is possible. ",

    "body": "There should be a block called \"game board\". This block would sometimes generate in villages and could be sold by librarians for 36 emeralds, similar to bells. It can be mined with anything, no need for silk touch, and the axe is the fastest tool. This block would allow you to play board games against villagers, provided that you have the correct rulebook, more on that later.\n\nThe block itself doesn't work unless you add 2-4 stairs of any kind around it. They do not need to be the same type of stairs either, but they need to be oriented in such a way that they look like chairs. Once you've done that, you can click on one of the stairs, and if there is any villager nearby, they would come close and a game would start. As many villagers as there are chairs and the game would allow to play wil show up, if there are enough nearby. If there are more than needed nearby, some villagers will just assist the match looking from the side.\n\nThe game board block can store a rulebook, and the way it works is similar to banner patterns in looms, except it will persist even if you close the UI. The rulebook will determine which game will be played. If a game is started without a rulebook, the game will be checkers. Rulebooks can be obtained, again, in a similar way to banner patters, usually by crafting a book with other items, but also in other ways.\n\nThese could be some ideas for rulebooks:\n\n* Chess rulebook: crafted with a book, 1 polished diorite and 1 polished blackstone.\n* Backgammon rulebook: crafted with a book and 2 pointed dripstone.\n* Ludo rulebook: crafted with a book, 1 red wool, 1 blue wool, 1 green wool and 1 yellow wool.\n* Go rulebook: sold by wandering traders for 9 emeralds or by librarians for 12.\n* Reversi rulebook: crafted with a book, 1 crafting table, 1 stone button and 1 polished blackstone button.\n* Hex rulebook: crafted with a book and 1 honeycomb block.\n* Poker rulebook: occasionally dropped by pillagers and vindicators when killed with at least Looting I (similar to pumpkins on Halloween).\n* Royal game of Ur rulebook: found as loot in desert temples.\n* Mahjong rulebook: dropped by iron golems if killed by the ender dragon.\n* Shogi rulebook: same as the chess rulebook but using any enchanted book instead of a regular book.\n* Connect 4 rulebook: crafted with a book, 1 red dye and 1 yellow dye.\n\nYou can add more ideas in the comments. *(don't)*\n\nThe skill level of the villager depends on its profession. From easiest to hardest: farmer, butcher, shepherd, fisherman, leatherworker, armorer, weaponsmith, toolsmith, fletcher, stonemason, cartographer, cleric, librarian. Nitwits and unemployed villagers will have a random skill level, potentially being better than librarians or worse than farmers. In addition, you can play against illagers, too, including witches. They will turn passive (including to villagers) for as long as you are playing against them, or are watching a game, but they'll turn hostile immediately afterwards, so be careful. Evokers and witches are actually more skilled than librarians, while pillagers and vindicators are about the same level as an armorer. Ravagers can also play, but they will be the least skilled.\n\nWinning a game improves your reputation in the village (that also includes winning against illagers if you are in a village). Losing or leaving early has no effect.\n\nFinally, you can play with other players if they are fast enough to join before the villagers. But that will prevent you from improving your reputation in the village, if there is one nearby.",

I think it's back! \n\nTL;DR: my favourite ES shoe since the ES2. A snug, light upper combined with a fairly firm but adequately cushioned and snappy midsole that enjoys picking up the pace but can still handle slower paces. Despite it's weight increase, it doesn't feel like a heavier shoe on the run. \n\nMyself: 31yo male, 65kg, midfoot strike, 5k pb 17:31, 10k pb 35:56, race on trails. Current active shoes are the Mizuno Neo Vista 1, Neo Vista 2, Neo Zen, Rebellion Pro Low, Adidas Takumi Sen 10, Saucony Kinvara Pro, ASICS Novablast 4, Puma DNE2, On Cloudeclipse.\n\nThe run: 19km at 4:40-4:50min/km with 4x1k repeats at 3:50-4:00min/km. All on dry road/footpath. \n\nBackground: My first foray into the Endorphin Speed line was with the ES2 and that shoe is still possibly my favourite shoe of all time (the Neo Zen runs it close). That shoe just felt so raw. Granted, it had it's issues. It wasn't very stable which just added to the fun in my opinion, and it ran very narrow which again, wasn't too much of a problem for me but was for many others. Annoyingly, once I wanted a second pair of ES2s, they were all gone locally and so I put them away and took them out every now and then for a bit of nostalgia and only retired them earlier this year. \n\nI then went through three pairs of ES3s which was a very different shoe to the 2 but one I still liked obviously. It was softer, more stable but just wasn't as fun as the ES2. Funnily enough though, it's the shoe I ran my 5k pb in, in the days before I owned a pair of carbon shoes. Then came the ES4 which I just didn't like. The upper felt baggy, it got a bit firmer but not a fun, fast firm, more like a bottoming out type of firm and it just felt like a cumbersome shoe. I only made it to about 400km in my pair of those before I felt that the midsole had died and I donated them on. \n\nNow to the ES5. I honestly wasn't planning on getting a pair but the shop I work in got them earlier in the week before release and I loved the look of them. The ES line has been a bestseller time after time for the shop too so I thought it would be a good idea to get out and give them a try myself. I paid full price. Most of all, who doesn't love the mutant colourway?! \n\nThe look: I love it. The easiest way I can describe my affection for the aesthetics is that the shoe looks proportional. The ES4 just looked all midsole with a heel tail to me. This could well be just because the top of the midsole in the mutant colourway is white and blends with the upper but whatever it is, I'm loving it. I think I might swap out the yellow laces for white though, they're a bit much for me even as a 1\" BOA wearer. \n\nThe upper/fit: A huge improvement over the ES4 for me. Despite weighing 5g more, it just feels like less shoe and I think that's primarily down to the upper. It's a much lighter material with plenty of holes in the mesh and a really cool hexagonal pattern that is actually quite transparent so the insole colour is clearly visible through it. Also, there's less upper, gone is the baggy feeling and having to cinch way down as I had to in the ES4. The first thing I noticed when I slipped them on is that the heel cup is really snug and really nice, the shoes just automatically felt like they were secure on my feet.  Width wise feels narrower but I don't think it actually is, I just think it's because there's less material. One thing I did suffer with during the first 20-30km in both the ES3 and ES4 was a dull pain on the outside of my foot in line with the arch, I could only ever put it down to the winged plate. The pain did go away in both shoes but was annoying nonetheless. I had no such pain in the ES5 and I'm glad for it. True to size fit perfectly. One note I will make is that the yellow dye from the tongue gusset did leak onto my socks, just FYI if you're wanting to keep that white pair of socks completely white.\n\nThe ride: it's early days but I really enjoyed it. It's still firm underfoot, there's no doubting that, but it's a fun firm that still has plenty enough cushion to not feel like you're hitting the ground hard. It felt just as good running 4:50s as it did at sub 4. During the repeats, the shoe did feel snappy especially the further forward in the shoe I was landing. I had no issues with instability. I also had no issues with the forefoot feeling flat as I did in the ES4. There is absolutely no hint or feeling of running in a heavier shoe compared to the ES4. The nylon plate is pretty flexible but definitely adds some structure to the midsole. The rocker is nice, it's apparent but not aggressive. They rolled through their stride really smoothly and less clunky than I found the ES4 to be. Probably a combination of the lighter, snugger upper and the less cumbersome platform underneath, the ES5 feels really light on the run. Time will tell as to how the midsole plays out over a few hundred kms but hopefully these will retain some life well past 400km. \n\nThe outsole: no issues on anything I ran on but everything was dry so I should hope not to see any issues. Saucony's have never been too good in the wet so I'm not holding out much hope for these but thankfully we don't see too many wet days here. \n\nConclusion: Without doubt, my favourite Endorphin Speed version since the ES2. I sort of lost hope in this line after the ES4 and then when I heard that the new version was getting a price increase, I was worried with how many great shoes now are priced at a lower price point (Neo Zen, DN3 etc.). But, I think they've justified their price point and in my opinion, the magic seems to be back. This shoe will sit nicely for me as both a daily and a tempo option. ",

        "body": "It's difficult to overstate exactly how fun the original Endorphin Speed was. It was bouncy as hell and wildly unstable, which made for a positively delightful running experience at a time when most companies really hadn't figured out super shoes yet. Basically it was lightning in a bottle that couldn't really be replicated in later versions as product development teams figured out \"solutions\" to the \"problems\" inherent to it.\n\nThe second iteration was pretty close though. It didn't quite capture the magic the same way as the original, but all the DNA was still in there. Version 3 is when it really started feeling watered down. And not to throw shade or anything. I'm sure it was probably a better shoe by every objective metric, but objective metrics aren't what made the Endorphin Speed great. I didn't bother trying the fourth version.\n\nIf the 5 manages to recapture some of whatever secret sauce was poured into the original, I'm all for it.",

    "body": "Background: This was a snobby high class apartment community in the Southern California Orange Curtain filled with residents and managers who think every problem is balanced by money and anyone else (contractor, service employee, or other) was below them and expendable. As the Security contractor we were expendable, and they made it clear because we were hired to replace the previous contractor that we found out were set up to fail by the same managers that hired us. We weren't hired to provide security so much as for the company to have someone to blame as their liability shield if something went wrong.\n\nThe Conflict: Among the many residents thinking that their high rent entitled them to the right to complain about anything they wanted was one that we will refer to as 4323. He would call in and complain at any hour he wanted, most commonly 15+/- minutes from 10 pm when the pools closed to complain about people in the pool or to tell us how to do our job (the pools close at 10 pm and most of the time he called before that just to say we needed to close them). He would complain we weren't doing out job, didn't do out job, he couldn't sleep because a neighbor was screwing too loudly, all sorts of ridiculous things. He also left his window open which was probably why he supposedly could hear everything and later became his Achilles heel. The property managers offered to move him to a different apartment but he refused because of his view of the pools on the top floor and the managers would always settle because he paid a really high rent anyways. After over a year of this we retaliated.\n\nConflict resolution/Revenge: The previous month 4323 had called in 3 times a day every day so I told the other security guards to pee in a bucket or contribute something virile and liquefied to the \"gag bag\" every time he called and it would be put to good use after 3 days we had enough. I was still in college as an engineering major at the time and after enough fluid mechanics and hydraulic lab work, I had designed a prototype revenge machine: basically a giant super-soaker with a .5\" nozzle powered by compressed gas (I used a propane tank because it was convenient). As security guards we had access to the roof and I already had a vantage point in mind for. I had a previously calculated set of tables to make the perfect shot, a little bit of trigonometry and a partner to help set up the shot and with the pull of the trigger we sent over a gallon of piss, fish guts, yellow dye, and left over Indian food through the window and onto their rug without even grazing the window edges all while under the cover of night. 4323 apparently didn't have any idea what had happened the following morning, complaining got them nowhere but they got pegged with the cleaning fine because 4323 couldn't prove they didn't make the mess themselves and they were at home at the time (which was even more surprising they did not hear a splash after all the noise complaints they made that year).\n\nTL;DR: \n-Guy #4323 complains too much too long to security guard\n-security guard uses 'engineering': makes giant putrid filled super-soaker\n-guy #4323 gets fined for cleaning mysterious stinky yellowish stain on rug\n\nedit 11/25/13:\nfor those asking more about the \"bad baby\" super soaker device: \n\n-The closest existing commercially available water gun I can think of to what I used would be the \"stream machine\" if you can imagine a preassurized gas chamber behind the plunger (http://www.jmcremps.com/images/StreamMachineQF_WEB.jpg). It also had a main spring in the gas chamber connected to the media divider behind the fluid reservoir but it didn't actually contribute force but assisted the assemble of the device. \n\n-this actually wasn't the first time I fired this contraption before, just the first time I used the equipment off campus off record and using a fluid that wasn't entirely water. The first time I tried it on a grass lawn on campus I didn't take into account the recoil (impulse momentum principle: sum of forces = pQv) and the \"bad baby\" ended up recoiling backwards and shot some of us in the back of the knee with the stream of water. This problem was solved by standing on the mounting plate. Also this contraption was originally part of a lab experiment and occasionally used to encourage prospective students to enroll in engineering.\n\n-thankfully the jet nozzle at the end of the tube was enough to keep the flow laminar but there was a system of about 40 parallel straws each 2\" long at the end of the chamber just before the shut off valve before the nozzle similar but not the same as a fireman's hose. These straws also had the double feature of stopping the plunger before it hit the end of the chamber like a shock absorber if the shut off valve was left on before the chamber emptied. It also means that there was about 1/4 liter of fluid left in the straw and nozzle.\n\nfor those asking why we felt #4323 deserved the wrath of the bad baby:\n\n-It wasn't just his calling in and complaining, he was telling us how to do our job and how to solve problems before they were even a problem on a neurotic scale. He often did make phony calls to us about a trespasser in the pool area while we were already watching it, this is one of the most selfish things you can do to call security attention to a knowingly false problem and forcing us to leave other areas vulnerable. If we were law enforcement he would've been cited for harassment or false reporting. And we weren't the only people troubled by 4323, the management and other residents had growing problems as well. Management would not act because of money, and his making enemies made it harder for him to think of a suspect. He also had a bad habit of smoking off the balcony and raining ashes onto the cabana area below, which we witnesses and did eventually cause comparable level of property damage, but 4323 money meant more to the management. Also last I checked, 2 years after this incident and he was still making the same BS calls and complaints and still refused to move to another apartment, clearly bitching was his hobby.\n\n-and for the people asking about the distance we used a 3-4-5 triangle to measure the 30' shot. (30' hypotenus)\n\n-Props for the literal Revenge Machine!",

I know what goes into making various sweet treats, and since I've started baking, I've paid more attention to the ingredients on the label of desserts I buy at big stores like Publix and Kroger. Since I've started doing that, I've literally stopped buying desserts there. \n\nA key lime pie my family got from Publix today literally contains **palm oil, red dye, yellow dye, blue dye, corn syrup**, and more. I mean, why the hell does my key lime pie need to be a sickly shade of green?? For what reason???? \n\nI turned to the tiramisu, hoping for something better, only to find that the first ingredient was *cream cheese* instead of *mascarpone*. Filled with corn syrup and some dye to make it more yellow too. \n\nWhat is wrong with these places? When I buy a baked good, I want to be buying a baked good, not some mass produced, dyed, corn syrup filled nonsense. So tired of these big grocery stores swapping out delicious ingredients for cheaper alternatives. My local bakery never engages in these practices, and although their prices are a little higher, I'll gladly indulge if it means avoiding unnecessary dyes and palm oils.",

Capitalism *only* produces for a profit. \n\nThus; If a shitty palm oil, food dyed, corn syrup filled, earth-killing tasteless shitberg of a cake is what is required for a large grocer to turn a profit; then that is *exactly* what it will produce. \n\nIts 2023 and we need to stop going around in mindless consumerist circles which only end up feeding capitalism our ignorance as well as our exploited wages. Capitalism is a one-way road to collapse and degradation. If capitalism needs to produce starvation for a profit to be made; then that is *exactly* what it will produce.\n\nShitty products aren’t your problem. The profit motive which demands shitty products be overproduced to deny you access to quality or durable goods is your problem. Your small local bakery doesn’t have the means to over produce shitty products to maximize their profit, so their quality still matters to make something sellable at their higher price due to real ingredients. Hence the higher price and fewer items on their shelves. If you want something better, made with real ingredients, hopefully made by people earning a living wage; then the costs are going to go up, WAY up - which is anathema to capitalism’s endless mode of production, and why your small local bakeries get gobbled up by real-estate grocery monsters the same way Amazon killed every local book, gift, and toy shop and Starbucks and Caribou killed local coffee shops and diners. Ironically Caribou started as a local coffee shop, but that profit motive… The local bakery still needs pride to turn a small profit or stay afloat, a very anti-capitalist idea. Pride has no place in capitalism if it diminishes profit. 😉\n\nWhy, where, and how matter existentially more than the what. Capitalism is the producer which makes consumption a problem.

Is there a safe way to remove dye without hurting the dress? She said it used to be white but dyed it yellow so she could wear it as a guest at Someone's wedding. This dress basically is what i would want my wedding dress to be. Which is why i would like to dry getting the yellow out. Ultimately i dont want to harm the dress.

Although the physalis berries are edible when ripe, not all of them are enjoyable – like the *Physalis alkekengi* – so you should always proceed with caution. Unripe berries, however, are poisonous and should not be eaten. They contain alkaloid solanine which can lead to the same poisoning symptoms mentioned above. Nevertheless, there are some exceptions to the rule – take for example tomatillos (*Physalis ixocarpa*), which can also be eaten when unripe.\"\n\nAnd here from Backyardlarder :\n\n\"The fruits of Chinese lantern, *Physalis alkekengi*, are often described as poisonous but are actually edible ***if fully ripe***. The rest of the plant including the calyx (the lantern) is toxic. The usual advice is to wait until the calyx is skeletonised\"\n\nWhat seems to be agreed upon is that the unripe fruit is poisonous.

Tartrazine, however, slows light to just the right speed, allowing it to pass through the tissue without scattering, especially in red and orange wavelengths.",

Here's specific comment by /u/boylookingfordaddy[1]  that I found especially helpful:\n\n\"For the place I used to work at, as far as sauces go, you need to make sure that you have a base down: sugar, oyster sauce, salt, msg, and garlic (and either potato or corn starch). Depending on whether its brown or garlic depends on how much you need of either sugar or salt, as brown is more salty and garlic is sweet. You also need to add WATER, at least half needs to be water, sautee and then boil a few star anise, some ginger slices, carrot slices, and celery to flavor the water. then strain the water into the sauce and mix, let cool, and before serving add a bit of whicever starch you are using to the sauce as you are heating it up, if you dont the sauce will be to thin and wont coat the veggies and meat. (Pro-Tip: to get that bright red color in garlic sauce, you need tomato shade)\nNow for the lo mein noddles, we dont make ours personally but we buy bags of lo mein noodles uncooked, and boil them in water in a big wok, then we drain them when they are tender and add a bit of oil to them.\nFried rice: about 5-6 pints of long grain rice (for a full pot of rice in a commercial cooker) Wash the rice once, fill to the 20 cup line. Add 7 tablespoons msg and salt, 3 tablespoons of sugar, Few shakes of white pepper, some vegetable oil, put in the rice cooker after mixing in seasoning, then add some thick soy sauce, (probably same as the dark soy you use OP), then add some yellow dye for the color, You need to be pretty heavy handed in the soy and shading, if not the color of your rice will look like pee and not like dark yellow, delicious fried rice.\nand finally chicken wings, not very special, same seasoning as rice, salt sugar msg, and white pepper, let that marinade for a little while with some water, then add flour to coat and then fry.\nHope I helped out!\nAnd super sorry for the shitty ass grammar.\"\n\n\nOriginal comment and post : http://www.reddit.com/r/askculinary/comments/2d489i/an_important_discussion_about_chinese_food/cjlzvgo",

You shouldn't need any soy or yellow food colouring to get it that nice fried rice colour.\n\nI'm an apprentice chef at a big place and had a day in one of the aisan kitchens last week. This is how we made fried rice:\n\nHot wok, add 2 tbsp veg oil, 2 lightly whisked eggs and stir about the pan to break it up as it cooks. When the oil starts to separate from the eggs you add in a handful of the red bbq pork and cook until that starts to look glossy from the fat coming out of it. Now add your rice, about 2 cups, and break it up with the back of a ladle/spoon/whatever. Keep on shaking the wok until the rice is the colour you want and add a tsp of chicken stock powder (no doubt includes MSG) and just a little white pepper. Add a handful of pre-blanched vegetables and toss through. Chuck in some spring onion before a final shake and then it's ready to serve.\n\nThis was some of the best tasting fried rice I've had.

The first one was in for the full half hour; the final one was only in for two seconds. Then I immediately drained them and dumped them in ice water.\n\nThe whole process was surprisingly straightforward, and I’m pretty sure it’s the only cheap way to get decent quality Choc caps in a nice color.

    "body": "Hello everyone! Today I'd like to make a neat suggestion that may be beneficial to Free-To-Play players. As an 11 year RuneScape veteran, I've played my fair share of Free-To-Play and I know how tough it can be sometimes to obtain certain items. Well, just this month, Jagex made Mystic gear craftable and F2P. So, without further a-do... I'd like to make a suggestion on adding a F2P boss that drops Mystic Cloth and other magical items! I am suggesting this due to Mystic Cloths current horrid rarity and low stock for the Free-To-Play market. \n\nFirst, I feel that since Mystic Robes are for those mid-tier magical players, it's only fair that the requirements be simple, but, somewhat challenging due to the nature of the robes. These requirements would be:\n-Completion of Rune Mysteries\n-Completion of Shadow Over Ashdale\n-Completion of Dragon Slayer (Due to the requirement to wear the Mystic Robe Top)\n-39 Dungeoneering\n\nSecond, Ashdale is completely dead content except for the likes of the weekly Kraken boss, Agoroth. So... Let's give it some use! For the location of this boss, I think it would be ideal to go back to Ashdale to fight a new evil in town... This evil is the Mystic Mage. The Mystic Mage lies in a new cavern that would be located north of Agoroth's cave. Closer towards the tower that we climbed down during Shadow Over Ashdale, a new Dungeoneering door will be located. Inside this cave, you will face the boss itself.\n\nInside this cave will be the Mystic Mage, many book shelves, and a wall layout similar to Lexicus Runewright's room during Dungeoneering (hence the 39 Dungeoneering requirement).\n\nOutside of this cave resides Lily... The Mystic Mage's daughter. Lily is tired of her father's hot headed antics and wants a noble adventurer to defeat him once and for all. A player must speak to her and receive an item called \"Magic Dust\" in order to let the player inside of the cave. The player must meet all the requirements in order to receive the dust, otherwise, they will be told \"Shut up, [----].\" The player must then sprinkle the dust onto the cave entrance in order to enter. This only has to be done once.\n\nThird, lets talk about mechanics and how it would fight. The Mystic Mage should pose a threat to anyone under the combat level of 90. He would have 35,000 health and would be fairly less intense than the King Black Dragon, however, would still have a fairly challenging fight.\n\nPlayers should note that the Mystic Mage hits MODERATELY with a combined max hit of 6000 (see below) and is 75% immune to magical damage.\n\nAttacks: \n\nBasic - The Mystic Mage casts a fire spell on the player as well as EoC abilities such as Combust. The fire spell can hit a maximum of 750 damage. Combust would hit a total of 0-900 damage on the player with the base max hit dealing 0-180 damage. This would tick 5 times. These cannot be avoided, however, would be halved by the Protect from Missiles prayer.\n\nModerate - One of these two abilities will activate when the boss is at the following health: 30,000 , 25,000 , 15,000, and 1,000\n\n1.He's fed up! The Mystic Mage traps the player with Asphyxiate after teleporting 3 squares in-front of the player and shortly after will stun the player for the duration of the attack. This attack can damage the player with a base max hit dealing 0-400 damage. This can tick upwards to 6 times in 3 seconds, however, it can be avoided by running behind a wall in the Mystic Mage's cavern. The damage input of this ability by the boss can be halved by using the Protect from Missiles prayer. \n\n2. The Mystic Mage runs towards the player with a magical barrel. The Mystic Mage shouts \"I've had enough of you!,\" and then begins to charge at the player. This barrel detonates twice during his run. The initial hit to the player would deal 1,250 damage followed by an additional hit of 750 damage after 2 seconds. The player can avoid both hits by simply running behind a wall or running in a different direction than what the Mystic Mage is headed. If the player manages to be behind a wall when the Mystic Mage begins to charge, the barrel will detonate on the Mage instead causing 750 damage to him and causing him to teleport to the other side of the room in a fit of anger. This move can be avoided by standing behind a wall, or, casting the freedom ability 1 second prior to him landing his attack. Casting freedom before the attack will cause the boss to fall back. Both the player and boss will be dealt 500 damage.\n\nUltimate - Twice per encounter, the Mystic Mage will cast his ultimate ability. This ability will be activated when the boss has reached 20,000 health and 5,000 health. The Mystic Mage teleports the player into the middle of his cavern. He appears in front of the player and says \"Prepare to be eliminated!\" Shortly after, the player would experience a 1 second stun. This stun can be broken by the \"Freedom\" ability. When this ultimate occurs, 8 books, from each angle of the room, will fly off of the bookshelves and aim towards the middle of the room. Each successful book to hit a player will cause 750 damage a piece. The books will take approximately 2.5 seconds to reach the middle of the room, so you have very limited time to react and run! If a player runs into one of the books, the player will take 750 damage. This ability can be avoided and can be reduced in damage by the Protect from Missiles prayer.\n\n\nWeaknesses/Defence:\n\n1. The Mystic Mage hates magic users other than himself. He will be almost completely immune to any magical attacks. The Mage has to prove he is the mightiest of them all, so, he takes a 75% reduce in damage from Magical attacks.\n\n2. The Mystic Mage is scared of needles! His weakness would be ranged weapons, however, would also fall weak to melee combat.\n\n-Range would be the most ideal towards the Mystic Mage due to his absolute terror of needles. One time, at band camp, The Mystic Mage slipped on a cabbage and landed right on a needle sending him screaming all the way home to mum. \n\n-Melee would be alright against the Mystic Mage. Stabbing weapons would be the most effective due to his fear of needles! He would have complete immunity over crushing weapons due to his hard headed antics. Show him who's boss.\n\n-Magic... Oh Magic... OH OH OH IT'S NOT WORKING!\n\nFinally, lets talk about the drops! The Mystic Mage has been stashing some of his Runecrafting, Magic, Prayer, Fletching, and Crafting knowledge in the back of his cavern. However, the grand old magician has an overabundance of Mystic Cloth after robbing the Grand Exchange! Whatever will we do? Well... You kill him of course.\n\nALWAYS DROPS:\nMystic Cloth - x2 (Unnoted)\nBig Bones - x1\n\nCommon Drops:\nCoins - 2,000 to 45,000 (45,000 Rare drop)\nMystic Cloth - x3 (Noted)\nPure Essence - x50 (Noted)\nThread - x20\nAir & Fire Runes - x75/x35 (Dropped together)\nAdamant Helm - x1\nNature Runes - x15\nFlax - x50 (Noted)\n\nUncommon:\nRune Full Helm - x1\nMystic Cloth - x6 (Noted)\nDragon Bones - x5 (Noted)\nBark - x3 (Un-noted)\nUncut Gems - x2 (Un-noted)\nYew Logs - x50 (Noted)\nBowstrings - x25 (Noted)\n\nRare:\nMystic Wand - x1 (1/128)\nMystic Orb - x1 (1/128)\nMystic Robe Set Piece - x1 (1/128)\nMystic Cloth - x15 (Noted) (1/75)\nMagic Logs - x25 (Noted) (1/75)\nRune Platebody - x1 (1/75)\nAdamant Platebody - x1 (1/75)\nMagic Logs - x2 (Noted) - (1/128)\n\nUltra Rare:\nMystic Mushroom - x1: This unlocks the Tiny Wizard pet. (1/1,000)\n\nMystic Jar - x1: This jar is filled with the magic blue dust of the Mystic Mage. The player can give the jar to Lily in return for 50 mystic cloth or 20,000 bonus experience in Magic. This item may also be traded to Lily in exchange for a \"Mystic Dye Recipe.\" [See below] Receiving this item notes that you failed at a pet drop. (1/1000)\n\nMagic Cog - x1: This item can be attached to any t50 armor (legs & plate) to upgrade it to t57 armor. Once this is done, it will become untradable and can only be taken off by Lily for a cost of 500k. The player will NOT receive the cog back. (1/500)\n\nMystic Dust - x1: This can be traded to Lily in exchange for a Mystic Robe Set to be dyed either Dark or Light. (1/200) [Is NOT the same as the dust given to the player upon talking)\n\nLight or Dark Mystic Robe Set Piece - x1: Any item inside of these sets as a drop indicates that a player would have received Mystic Dust. (1/200)\n\n\nWhat is \"Mystic Dye:\"\nA brand new dye that can be unlocked by trading Lily a Mystic Jar. This dye can be made by Aggie in Draynor village for the cost of the following ingredients: Blue Dye, Red Dye, Yellow Dye, and 75 Mystic Cloths. The dye will have 5 uses and can be made as many times as the player chooses to make it. The dye can be used on any Blue Mystic Robe items to dye them either Light or Dark.\n\nThat's all guys! I hope you enjoyed this little suggestions (or big suggestion). Hope to see everyone's feedback! Cheers!\n\nIf this post gets a J-Mod's interest, I will surely be willing to talk to them for any more details that I can think of.",

    "body": "New items, resources, reworks and rewards incoming! \n\nFor this update, we wanted to focus on improving Everdale for the long haul, while adding a boost of new content. \n\nValley management is getting a lot friendlier thanks to the removal of the Leader position. Now everyone votes together and no single person has the power to derail a whole Valley.\n\nTrade Relations have been seriously buffed, with added depth, perks and events. The Iceberg Isles offerings have changed: they are now your #1 source for a brand new Everdale resource, Iron Ore. And the Summery Woods? Well, now they sell Potion Ingredients, too. Otto has lost his iron grip on the potion ingredient market! \n\nSpeaking of Otto, he’ll no longer ask you for certain higher level products… The man went too far and now he’s taking it down a notch.\n\nBut the Everdale economy is much bigger than Otto, isn’t it? All resource values have been reworked, with many recipes changed. This includes the dye economy, which has been a pain point for more advanced Villagers. Similarly, the potion economy should feel less random now that we’ve dedicated an entire trade ship to supporting it. \n\nWe’re also making events more valuable by boosting the rewards earned by completing tasks. We hope that makes them more attractive than ever. Even more attractive than Platurtle in a bespoke sundress.  \n\nIf you’re hoping for new items to trade, we’ve also got you covered there. We added a Blacksmith and Smelter to go with that shiny new ore of yours! Along with some valuable new products. Is it hot in here, or is it just my smelter? \n\nReputation decay, which annoyed everybody, is GONE. Now, any excess Reputation Points you earn will go to the Everchest, a repeating source of rewards. \n\nFor the shop, we’ve added the Gem Tree. It’s an amazing value, offering gems for 30 days at a discount from standard gem packs. We also added Deco Gems, a new resource used to purchase cosmetics. Plus, a whole bunch of other offers in different price ranges. \n\nIt wouldn’t be an update without tons of balance changes and bug fixes. For example, we’ve rearranged the research trees, more specifically for high level players. \n\nAnd now… if you’re a brave soul with time on your hands, the (nearly) full list of details going into Update 2. Strap in. You’re in Stefu’s funhouse now. \n\nTrade Relation Rework:\n\n* All new Trade Relation roads with new perks for all trade partners\n* The simple trade relation progress with +X to rewards has been removed and replaced with Trade relation roads\n* Final perks are repeating and each trade partner has their own unique repeating perk\n* Iceberg Isles and Summery Woods will be reset and locked for existing players\n* They are both unlocked from special events that spawn in the Valley soon after researching trade relations\n\nFavorite Products:\n\n* All trade partners have two products that they favor over others\n* There's a slightly higher chance that the trade partner requests their favorite products\n* Tasks for favorite products are larger than normal\n* Completing favorite product tasks yields better rewards\n\nIntroductory Events:\n\n* The introductory events for Iceberg Isles and Summery Woods have some new rules\n* They don't have timers\n* You can’t use gems to instantly complete tasks\n* They request products that are not necessarily unlocked yet\n* They spawn separately from the normal event pool when their conditions are met\n* There are two follow-up events for the Iceberg Isles introductory event\n\nResearch Swap Perk and Trade Relation Research Tree Branches:\n\n* New research tree nodes – these are locked until you reach the Research Swap perk for the corresponding trade partner\n* Note! it is possible to lose the Research Swap access if you switch to a Valley that hasn't unlocked it yet. You will keep any previous research but can't start new ones in the branch locked by the Research Swap\n\nThe Iron Economy:\n\n* You acquire iron ore by trading with the Iceberg Isles\n* Iron ore is stored in the Warehouse\n* Iron ore is NOT used for trading. \n* You refine iron ore in the Smelter.\n* You can build the Smelter in the village (acquire it from the Iceberg Isles Research Swap)\n* Smelter produces and stores Iron Ingots from Iron Ore\n* Iron Ingots are used for trading, crafting and construction\n* Valley has a new building: The Blacksmith\n* The Blacksmith has 3 recipes: Iron Sculpture, Iron Nails and Reinforced Plank\n* They are all used for trading but Iron Nails and Reinforced Plank are also used for mid and high level Valley construction\n\nExisting Trade Relation Progress Will Be Reimbursed:\n\n* All points for Glimmering Dales and Highland Academy will remain the same\n* All points for Iceberg Isles and Summery Woods will be evenly distributed to Glimmering Dales and Highland Academy\n\nThe Biiiiiiig Resource Economy Rework:\n\n* Resource valuations have been thoroughly reworked with a fundamental change in the principles of how e.g. villager time is valued\n* Essentially every resource has a different valuation now and their relative values are very different\n* Several recipes have been reworked to improve the balance and to adapt to the new valuation principles\n* Production areas have been rebalanced to new values resulting in all resources being faster per resource (except wheat, wheat is the same)\n* Roughly speaking, this results in village construction materials being less valuable \\*relative\\* to Valley products\n* This affects multiple things like: how much rewards you get, how much is requested in tasks, how much they cost in the shop etc.\n* Also event jobs and rewards have been adjusted accordingly resulting in e.g. event jobs giving more than double the rewards\n* Removed the concept of recipe tiers for everything but potions. This means that you can also craft high level products in a level 1 crafting building if you have the recipe\n* Dye economy specifically has been reworked quite a lot\n* Rainbow Dye uses Blue Dye, Red Dye, Yellow Dye and one Nectar (the missing magical ingredient to make it Rainbow color instead of brown!)\n* All products using Dyes now use a maximum of one of any specific Dye (e.g. Rainbow Suit uses one Rainbow Dye instead of the old three)\n* Note! because values of all products have been adjusted and there's lots of recipe and timer changes, it means that the absolute value of many products has been reduced (e.g. Rainbow Suit is significantly less valuable but also a lot easier to make)\n\nResearch Tree Reworks:\n\n* Both village and Valley research trees have been reworked for mid and high levels\n* Changes have been made to incorporate the new Research Swaps from trade relations\n* Changes have also been made based on feedback from players talking about their experiences with their journey through the research tree\n* Tech costs and building costs have been adjusted accordingly\n* Note! This rework might make some old progress look weird because you might have completed research at high levels or uncompleted at low levels. But don't worry! You keep everything you've researched so far but you just now have to research the \"gaps\" at early levels to continue with the higher levels.\n\nValley Building Tasks:\n\n* Changed parameters for how Valley building tasks are split\n* In general, resource amounts are split into smaller tasks\n\nReputation Road Reworks:\n\n* Removed reputation decay\n* Added “Everchest” to the end of the reputation road (a repeating chest that can be earned and reclaimed over and over again)\n* Everything above 20,000 has been reworked and reorganized because of the removed reputation decay\n* Some chests reworked to include deco gems\n* Potion ingredient rewards in chests increased\n* Old players will be able to reclaim all chests and perks above 20,000\n\nPotion ingredient economy rework:\n\n* Potion recipes completely rebalanced and reworked\n* Mandrake only used by research potions to make it viable to craft also other potions\n* Farming and no-food potions share ingredients\n* All resource harvesting potions share ingredients\n* Raven Feather and Sea Shells are included in normal potion recipes and are no longer solely tied to 2 and 3 star potion recipes\n* Potions use a little bit of nectar in their recipes\n* Otto gives more potion ingredients\n* Summery Woods gives mainly potion ingredients\n\nDeco Gems:\n\n* Deco gems are a new resource that can be used like gems but only for cosmetics in the shop\n* Visible costs for cosmetics in the shop have been changed to deco gems, but you can always use normal gems instead (communicated in the confirmation pop up)\n* Deco gems can be gained from reputation road chests, offer bundles and once per week for free. You can also purchase them from the shop with coins\n\nGem Tree:\n\n* For now, the Gem Tree is a limited time offer that can be purchased once per player\n* You can collect 20 gems per day for 30 days (600 gems for the cost of 180 gems)\n* Note! You can miss out on gems if you skip days (but it’s still easily good value even if you’d miss a few)\n\nShop and Offers:\n\n* Extend Franz the Fixer’s on-the-job time while he’s working\n* Potions in the shop are always discounted\n* You can buy normal cost potions directly in the potion usage user interface\n* Free decos removed from shop (replaced by deco gems system)\n* Every Sunday, you get a few free deco gems and the chance to buy a limited amount of deco gems with coins\n* Potion ingredients can appear in the shop among daily resources\n* Daily purchase limits of staple resources scaled up for higher levels\n* Removed old Starter Pack\n* New starter pack introduced at XP 3\n* Shop opens at XP 3 instead of XP 4\n* New level up packs introduced at levels 5 and 11-14\n* New offer bundles that appear after unlocking certain village research\n* Old players should see new research based offers appear randomly, max two at a time\n\nOther Bug Fixes and UI/UX Improvements (too many to list, but here are some selected ones):\n\n* Potion usage UI reworked. Highlights the relevant potions for the job at hand and allows you to buy potions if you don’t have them\n* Fixed situations where you can get stuck for not having inventory space for products (e.g. crafting buildings and events)\n* Lots of fixes and improvements to art and graphics\n\nWe'll have some more details coming in the next few days so keep your eyes open! :)  \n\n\nCheers,\n\nNick",

Have yet to unlock summery woods so its possible that will balance it, but on first look, 24 mandrake is ROUGH.\n\n\\- It'd be great to have the cumulative boosts to each trader nation back. Like the progress tree design is great but i'd be nice to have something at the bottom with \"+40% gold, +6 extra tasks\" (for glimmering dales for example)\n\n\\- Are the preferred trades permanent or will they cycle. Are they per ship or per nation. If they're permanent won't that put particular stress on certain resources?\n\nOverall, update looks very promising and I'm excited to get into it more! <3",

    "body": "This happened in 2004, I was 23 at the time.  My wife and I had just moved to Alabama and we were staying with my Mother while going through the final stages of the hiring process and looking for a place to live.  We had 3 dogs, yellow labs all of them.  \n\nOne evening I was sitting on the floor playing with our oldest dog when he jumped up to grab a baseball cap I had on, at the same moment I leaned over to grab him.  He missed and instead of grabbing the bill of the cap he bit down on my left eyeball.  It was very sudden and we more or less bumped heads so from my end I didn't even know what happened at first, all I felt was *Bonk* BLINDING PAIN.\n\nThe first sensation was intense stabbing pain in my eye, the kind of intensity that immediately tells you something is bad wrong and dumps a double shot of adrenaline into your system, which combined with the shock of the moment confused me a lot.  I could see, but my vision was uneven and splotchy, kind of like trying to look through wadded up cellophane.  I blinked and the pain went from excruciating to mind shattering.  I could FEEL the skin of my eyeball lose against my eye, but in the moment I thought it was something else ON my eye, something I MUST wash out NOW.  I also started screaming at this point.\n\nMy wife helped me up and to the kitchen, I put my head under the sink and ran water across my face.  When I opened my eye again the water flowed across and finished ripping my cornea the rest of the way off the surface of my eye.  The pain was so strong I vomited and collapsed to the floor, I didn't black out but I couldn't stand up.  This is the point when everyone decided it was time to go to the ER.\n\nYou have to understand what the pain is like.  Its unique.  Normally when you cut your arm you can put pressure or pinch or rub and generally distract your body from the pain.  This isn't like that.  This was more like a tooth ache in how no matter what you did, no matter how you moved, the pain stayed with you.  Only it wasn't an ache, it was razor sharp, imagine how you feel when you get something stuck in your eye, now imagine that across the whole surface of your eye, now imagine it to the greatest intensity you can, it was worse than that.\n\nOne of the first things I realized was that any pressure against my eye or any movement of my eye would cause the pain to go from a 10 to FuckYou.  ANY pressure.  ANY movement.  I tried to close my left eye and see with my right, but the pressure from the clenched eyelid alone was enough to make me scream and vomit.  So before we even made it to the hospital I had decided to wrap both eyes closed, lightly, so I could keep them closed, lightly, and wouldn't be tempted to move my eyes to look in another direction.  \n\nThe ER was mostly empty and we didn't have to wait long.  The doctor quickly put drops in the eye which completely numbed the pain and I could open it and look around.  At this point I could see normally, there wasn't anything obstructing the vision like before I washed it out.  The Doc put a yellow dye in my eye so he could see the scratches to the cornea.  His first reaction was \"Jeez its the size of Australia.\"  He tells me that basically its been ripped off pretty cleanly and the hole is more or less the size of my iris.  \n\nThe Doc says that the cornea is one of the fastest healing tissues of the body and that as long as it stays clean and isn't infected it should grow back to normal on its own without any loss to my vision.  He gave me an antibiotic drop, a saline drop, and a pain killer, he then tells me the pain killer is toxic and using it will prevent the cornea from healing, so if I used it to kill the pain it would hurt for that much longer.  WTF indeed.  He said it will continue hurting like this for about two weeks, then it would be a month until my vision was back to normal.   He was wrong.\n\nAs we are leaving the ER nurse tells me that cornea pain is worse than childbirth, that it is quite possibly one of the worst pains you can experience.  \n\nI decide to keep my plan of keeping both eyes wrapped up.  The pain is constant and unrelenting, oral pain killers do nothing.  Four times a day I have to open the eye so I can put the antibiotic drops in, it is truly torture, the first week or so my wife has to basically hold me down and put the drops in because the instinct to close the eye is too great.  I use the pain killer sparingly, maybe once a day, as the pain becomes too great.  \n\nIt takes 3 months before I can stand to open my good eye through the pain.  So for 3 months I live as if I was blind, with both eyes wrapped and closed.  It wasn't as hard as I expected it to be, but that may be because of the pain, my first instinct was to keep the pain as light as possible at all times, so I didn't so much care about not seeing, sight wasn't my highest priority. \n\nTo keep myself entertained I listened to DVDs.  I had recently inherited my late father's 400+ title movie collection.  So I went about listening to movies I had already seen.  In my mind's eye I could see the films from memory, but with only listening to them there was a lot that I hadn't noticed before.  I know everyone knows Star Wars has great sound direction, but if you haven't listened to it with your eyes closed, you need too, it is a whole other experience.  \n\nIf any of you ever lose your sight and need help adjusting in those first few months.  Listen to movies, listen to movies you know and love, your imagination will let you see them and it will give you a familiarity in a very unfamiliar world.\n\nSo for 3 months I was totally blind.  By the 4th month the pain had abated enough to open my right (good) eye for short periods of time.  The pain also went from being a knife like staccato, to more of a roiling ache which would build up the more I tried to use my good eye.  By the end of the 4th month I could start to open and use my left (bad) eye.\n\nIn the 5th month my vision in my bad eye was like looking through wax paper.  You couldn't see anything at all, not even color unless it was an inch from my face.  It was just 100% milky blur.  Slowly across the span of the month it came back to being just fuzzy vision, which introduced a whole new problem.\n\nI would get motion sickness from my own depth perception.  My brain would try to mesh the fuzzy vision with the good and it ended up having a real nausiating effect, almost like really bad 3d glasses.  My depth perception was horrible, things would look like they were right in front of me, but would be 6 feet away.  This lasted for about 3 weeks.\n\nBy the 6th month my vision was back to normal and the pain was gone.  But that is when the residual problem started.\n\nIt seems almost like the cornea on my left eye isn't stuck to my eyeball very well.  So if my eye dries out too much over night, it can stick to my eyelid, then when I wake up and open my eyes, I end up tearing it again (to a much lesser extent).  This causes pain and irritation for a day or two, sometimes it hurts VERY badly.\n\nThis used to happen about once a month, now it only happens about once a year.  Today is one of those days, this is the first time its happened this year and it is annoying as fuck.  That is what finally convinced me to write this AMA.  I woke up about 3am to my eye screaming at me, then spent a few hours putting in eye drops and making sure there wasn't any dirt or anything in there before giving up.  If the original pain was an 11 and \"normal\" pain a 5, this is about a 3.  Only enough to be extremely annoying and get in the way of daily life.\n\nThat's my story of how I had my cornea ripped off.  I would never wish it on anyone ever.  I'm lucky I didn't lose my vision.  Today I have 20/20 vision and no need for glasses or contacts, there is no noticeable artifacts or scaring in my field of vision.  \n\nAMA\n\n**EDIT 1:  Finance**\n\nWe got lucky, I guess, or as lucky as you can get and almost lose an eye.\n\nWe had just moved into town and were staying with my mom. I was at the start of a hiring process, still doing interviews with a company, my wife had just been hired.\n\nMy mom was great and let us stay there the whole time. My wife worked.\n\nMy job process basically froze. I had to delay the interviews. They were good about it and said I could continue the process when I was healed but they made it more or less clear that I couldn't fill the position without my sight. It worked to my favor also because they had a EXTREMELY long hiring process, so while I may have postponed one or two interviews, I still more or less fit into their time table. I wasn't getting a specific position and I wasn't cherry picked, I was basically off the street and they wanted me but didn't know where to put me. So the situation worked out.\n\nBy the 5th month when I could open both eyes but only \"see\" out of the good one, I finished the final interviews, which was kind of awkward because I was in my dizzy spell and couldn't drive.\n\nIt was the 6th month when I started and I was pretty much 100% by the first day.\n\nWe also stayed home the whole time. Or at least I did. So there wasn't much in the way of expenses. We didn't even have a car loan at that point. Everything my wife made went to help with groceries for the family or to savings so we could move out ASAP.\n\nIts also worth mentioning that since we weren't working, we didn't have insurance.  It took us 5 years to pay off the hospital bills and even those were minimal because it was only 1 visit from the doc and a 'script write. \n\n\n**EDIT 2: My Dog**\n\n[Here is the doggy that did it](http://i.imgur.com/jffBH.jpg) this is taken about a year after this all happened.  We still have him, he's older now, about 9 or 10.  His face is almost all white now and his coat is much lighter shade.  He still has the same personality and is caring and attentive.\n\nWe never held it against him.  It was my fault really, I was playing with the hat then put it on my head, he wanted it still and thought it was a part of the game.  I should have known better.  \n\nWe have 2 others, they look a lot alike actually, except one is about two sizes bigger.  (I call him my \"Dire Lab\")",

I had to see over 5 ophthalmologists to get mine fixed and was in and out of the hospital about once a month over a 2 year period. I would say the most frustrating part about it is the cornea doesn't totally heal itself even though you regain your vision over 1 or 2 weeks; in my case the initial tear never healed properly, so as I was sleeping my subtle eye movements will cause my cornea to catch on my own eyelids due to dryness and it would tear me a new one.\n\nAlso another thing OP didn't mention was after being given anesthetic drops the doc would literally force your eye open with a metal clamp device while he uses a pair of tweezers and messes around with your eyeball while you are fully conscious. Imagine staring at point blank range into tweezers pulling bits loose cornea out as unbearable pain slowly creeps in as the anesthetic wears off. I remember one of my ophthalmologists drawing a circle representing my eyeball and just colouring in about 75% of it to show me the extent of my tear.\n\nOh yea the fix after 2 years of repeated tears? I had to surgically scrape of my entire cornea so it would heal evenly, so instead of tweezers, it was a scalpel going across my eye while the doc tried to make friendly conversation with me.",

The next thing was the pain.  I screamed and hit the floor but my eye hurt so bad I could barely open it to get to contact out.  The solution is: Micro-filtered Hydrogen Peroxide (3%), Sodium Chloride (0.79%), Stabilized with Phosphoric Acid, Fluronic 17R4 (a cleaning agent).  So I went to my eye doctor and I had burned off a layer of my cornea in the exact shape of my contact lens.  It sealed it on and since I had so much of the solution on there, it made a little burny pool.  Icky.  Still, that pain was bad but it wasn't ANYTHING close to what happened to you.

        "body": "I have only had cornea \"injuries\". All stemming from my use of contact lenses.  I had initially been prescribed 1 single vision normal contact and one toric back in 1999ish.  I used those for a couple years, not the greatest vision, and went back to glasses for the most part until 2002. I was prescribed gas perms for my (roughly) -3.25 -2.25 x170 and -2.5 -2.25 x160 eyes.  Those actually worked very very well for about 3-4 years, but I hit financial hard times and the massively expensive lenses (Apparently I had bitorics or some odd GP's that cost 175 per lens, back when prescribed I was making a lot of money but come 2005, not so much). So glasses again until 2007. Now I mention GP's and the doc looks at the script funny and says \"OK we can make it work.\" And this time they are only likd $35 each - wtf?? So off I go for about a year, these lenses are always popping off, getting dry and bubbles, and overall not working well. I get haloes, bad focus, its like my eyes aren't working well, and I keep getting BAD spectacle blur (that is that you cannot see as well, even with glasses, after I take out the lenses)  I live with it pretty much, and I can see well, but not nearly as well as that first set of bitoric gp's. \n\nI ramble on only to explain how I came about to wearing this odd creation, as they are apparently really only for folks who cannot otherwise wear GP's, and that torics are not appropriate. \n\nSo I tell doc all this and he gets to looking at my eyes, and says \"well your cornea is all banged up, so lets see what we can do.\"  He fits me for \"Synergeyes\" hybrid lenses.  Its this really odd combo hard lens with a soft lens skirt.  I see about as well as I did with the normal GP's, that is that its a little odd focussing and things are sometimes unexplainably blurry.  So doc fits again - this time the \"high profile\" version.  Things go fairly well, still not the best, by now I'm sick of missing work for the eye doctor. \n\nFF a couple months. I have 8 hours of wearing endurance, tops.  They just stop feeling good and unless I yank em out at 5pm, the spectacle blur is so bad I'm feeling around.  One thursday I notice a little tickle like theres an itch on my eye, I pull em out wash em and put em back in.  No big whup right? No that annoying itch, twitch, tickle, whatever it was is now unignorable. By Saturday I KNOW something is wrong. Eye doesn't \"feel bad\" but damn does it suck going outside! The bright is incredibly bright and my eyes start to water. By Sunday I'm laying down in the dark in the living room trying to stare at TV and not to move much. I called the eye doctor and he tells me its likely a corneal tear or scratch, to keep it moist and covered with a damp rag and try not to move around or go outside.  I ended up with 2 days off work functionally blind and really pissed about it.  Doc says \"it happens\". \n\nIt repeats itself again about 6 weeks later (same lenses), this time doc replaces them. I wear for a couple weeks and am so fearful it'll repeat I just stop. \n\nIts been a couple months my wedding approaches.  Wife hates the glasses so begs me to wear them \"just for the weekend\".  OK. We have a small beach wedding so lets do it, on the thursday before the Monday of my wedding, I put them in to make sure everything is good. Bad move.  By Sunday I'm unable to walk outside.  The wedding went off with me in 1980's clip on mirror sunglasses over my tiny glasses. It was actually quite ridiculous. \n\nI laid off contacts again until just this past winter. I go see a brand new eye doc, who turns out to be an even better contact god.  Rips on my old doc about prescribing synergeyes to someone who doesn't \"need them\".  Tells me GP's aren't even required for my script (really what the hell?) prescribes me soft torics, best comfort, 14 hours endurance and at least 95% vision compared to my original super gp's. \n\nBest of all, haven't scratched my cornea in years. \n\n(EDIT:  A little bit of googling leads me to think the Synergeyes lenses actually caused \"Iritis\" and not a cornea scratch or tear.  This jives as other than the brightness, there was no real pain with my multiple events.)",

I go through a much much much lesser version of what you went through roughly 5 times a month.\n\n\"It seems almost like the cornea on my left eye isn't stuck to my eyeball very well. So if my eye dries out too much over night, it can stick to my eyelid, then when I wake up and open my eyes, I end up tearing it again (to a much lesser extent). This causes pain and irritation for a day or two, sometimes it hurts VERY badly.\"\n\n^This sounds very similar to what happens to me. I will just wake up and blink once and suddenly I feel pain ranging from mildly annoying to extremely intense (a few times). The way my optometrist described it is that the times that I have poked my or have been poked in the eye, my cornea hasnt healed correctly and a scar has been left. The scar is uneven with the rest of the cornea, so if my eyelid becomes really dry it can catch on the uneven scar areas. This happens to me in both eyes and sometimes happens in both eyes at the same time >_< The only thing I can do is put this vaseline type cream in my eyes for lubrication before I go to sleep but often even that doesn't help. They said their are certain special contacts you can wear at night that prevent this sort of thing though so maybe I should look into that :P \n\nThe thing I hate most about it (besides the pain lol) though is that people dont seem to understand how painful it can be. Like I've missed school before because of it and when I explain what happens I know for a fact that some people dont really believe that it can be painful enough to warrant missing school and that I'm just using it as an excuse.\nAnyways thanks for the inspiring story, next time it happens to me I'll just think about how my eye pain is, at worst, probably like 1/20th of your eye pain and be thankful that I havent had to go through the awful experience that you were forced to go through.",

Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.), calling it the “Louisiana MAHA bill”—a reference to his own “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) agenda that aims to crack down on food colorants, food additives, and seed oils.\nPer Senate Bill 14, beginning in 2028, Louisiana public schools and nonpublic school receiving state funds will be prohibited from serving in school breakfasts, lunches, and aftercare meals any foods containing one of 15 ingredients:\n\n- Blue dye 1\n- Blue dye 2\n- Green dye 3\n- Red dye 3\n- Red dye 40\n- Yellow dye 5\n- Yellow dye 6\n- Azodicarbonamide (ADA)\n- Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)\n- Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)\n- Potassium bromate\n- Propylparaben\n- Acesulfame potassium\n- Aspartame\n- Sucralose\n\n\nThe prohibition does not apply to foods sold in vending machines or at concession stands.\nSenate Bill 14 also contains a provision for the disclosure of “harmful ingredients,” which requires labeling of food products to disclose when they contain one of 40+ ingredients, beginning in 2028. The bill also requires foodservice establishments to display disclaimers on their menus or in a visible location when they prepare foods with seed oils (i.e., canola/rapeseed, corn, cottonseed, grapeseed, rice bran, safflower, soybean, and sunflower oils).\n\nRegarding the ingredient disclosure provision, manufacturers must label foods containing any of 40+ ingredients with a QR code directing consumers to a webpage that displays the following disclaimer: “NOTICE: This product contains [ingredient]. For more information about this ingredient, including FDA approvals, click HERE.” The disclaimer must link to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) webpage on food chemical safety. The 40+ ingredients covered by this provision are:\n\n- Acesulfame potassium\n- Acetylated esters of mono- and diglycerides (acetic acid ester)\n- Anisole\n- Aspartame\n- ADA\n- BHA\n- BHT\n- Bleached flour\n- Bromated flour\n- Calcium bromate\n- Canthaxanthin\n- Diacetyl\n- Dimethylamylamine (DMAA)\n- Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DSS)\n- Interesterified palm oil\n- Interesterified soybean oil\n- Lactylated fatty acid esters of glycerol and propylene glycol\n- Lye\n- Morpholine\n- Olestra\n- Partially hydrogenated oil (PHO)\n- Propylparaben\n- Sodium aluminum sulfate\n- Sodium lauryl sulfate\n- Sodium stearyl fumarate\n- Stearyl tartrate\n- Sucralose\n- Synthetic trans fatty acid\n- Thiodipropionic acid\n- Toluene\n- Potassium aluminum sulfate\n- Potassium bromate\n- Potassium iodate\n- Propylene oxide\n- Canthaxanthin\n- Blue dye 1\n- Blue dye 2\n- Citrus red dye 2\n- Green dye 3\n- Red dye 3\n- Red dye 40\n- Yellow dye 5\n- Yellow dye 6\n- Certified food colors by FDA\n\nAlthough several states have passed bills inspired by MAHA in recent months—such as Oklahoma, Texas, and West Virginia—the movement is controversial. Some stakeholders have disputed MAHA claims, calling them “an oversimplification without a clear understanding of the myriad complexities facing the production of safe and nutritious foods” that “ignores current food and animal food regulatory systems designed to promote public and animal health.”",

Yesterday I opened it up to take photos and list. \n\nI always look up medicines/chemicals I don't know, to make sure they're ok to ship. I looked up [Picric Acid](https://www.google.com/search?q=picric+acid+gauze+pad&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS932US933&oq=picric&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCAgAEEUYJxg7MggIABBFGCcYOzIOCAEQRRgnGDsYgAQYigUyBggCEEUYOTIHCAMQABiABDIHCAQQABiABDIHCAUQABiABDIHCAYQABiABDIHCAcQABiABDIHCAgQABiABDIHCAkQABiABKgCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) because I had a 3x3 inch gauze pad in the kit. \n\nSo we called 911, as the internet told us to. of course the dispatcher was confused, transferred us to fire. They were confused, transferred us to Hazmat (you could hear each person furiously googling in the background). Hazmat told us to wait outside for them, and they called the bomb squad as well. \n\n3 police cars, 2 hazmat trucks, 2 bomb squad trucks later.... they saved me from the first aid kit of death! Suited up and took the kit out in a magic box, took it to the range to detonate. \n\n\nSo BOLO for this shit, and please call the authorities if you've got any. I posted about this on my instagram last night, and had a customer there message me a few hours later saying the bomb squad just left her house, too! \n\n\nPicric Acid was widely used in the 1930s-40s as an antiseptic/burn treatment. it was also a commercial yellow dye, and a military grade Explosive. When it's dried out and crystalized it becomes highly unstable, especially reactive metal (like a first aid steel box), and there is a high danger of spontaneous explosion with percussive force.",

Basic high-school chemistry knowledge, a minimal amount of safety equipment and a brain can keep you safe most of the time. \n\nSome of my more entertaining discoveries: A moderately large collection of clocks and other instruments with radioactive dials, various explosive and oxidizing materials, and most recently enough potassium cyanide to poison by my rough math around 10,000 people at a photographers estate sale (no I didn't buy it).",

And it seems that if you just add enough resin dye and mica powder, with some occasional drops of alcohol, you'll eventually end up with very flexible resin. It does tear after prolonged over-bending. \n\nI reckon it's the yellow dye that has caused this, on picture 3 you can see the previous test on the right side. This test was from before I added yellow resin dye, and does not share the bending characteristic. \n\nIs there any chemist that can tell me what's going on?",

    "body": "###Your monthly reminder that yes, there are suggestions and ideas that do get over 200 upvotes from the Minecraft Community. Truly crazy, innit?\n\nIn this post are showcased all the suggestions that have achieved beyond 200 upvotes, as well as the 10 closest stragglers that were just shy of making the mark.\n\n---\n\nHello and welcome to this month's TMS!\n\nBefore we start, we're changing some of the formatting to something new from this month - for the post flair counts and the upvote counts, instead of presenting the data with the usual text, we're going to be using images of graphs! This will:\n1. Reduce the amount of characters, making it less likely to reach the character limit\n2. Make the TMS look more pretty and easier to read :D\n\nLet us know if you like the new changes!\n\n***edit:** I was going to include the images as embeds, but it turns out when making posts in the Markdown Editor, image embeds are impossible, so you have to use the Fancy Pants Editor, but if you use the Fancy Pants editor, you can't do complex formatting (such as different sized headings), which is a bit of a problem. Nonetheless the image link can still be included - it just means you might need to click on it to see it.*\n\nAlso, I can't take full credit for this month's TMS: u/TitaniumBrain *massively* helped on a lot of the work, such as counting up all the points from the monthly challenges and checking the wiki changes, and this month's theme and challenges were brought to you by u/Planemaster3000! Thanks to you both! :PufferThumbsUp:\n\n---\n\n**So, let's see how the new upvote and flair data looks:**\n\n### [Upvote Bands of Posts with 200+ Upvotes](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/741618183827619850/849549443774414848/unknown.png?width=868&height=612)\n\n### [Post Flair Data of Posts with 200+ Upvotes](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/689715753783394364/849208305671077958/unknown.png?width=910&height=567)\n\nThere were a total number of 92 posts which passed the 200 upvote mark, which is less than usual, but once 1.17's released in a week's time, maybe the ideas will start cooking back up again for the rest of Caves and Cliffs! And interestingly this month, the top two most popular flairs: **Blocks & Items** and **Mobs** have tied.\n\nAnd for those of you who prefer to sort via flair rather than upvotes, or maybe prefer the old lists rather than bar charts, we've got that covered too by the bot: **[here it is!](https://www.reddit.com/user/TitaniumBots/comments/npgy9o/top_monthly_suggestions_of_may_sorted_by_flair/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=minecraftsuggestions&utm_content=t1_h0pbpjj)**\n\n---\n\n#THEME: \"Structures New & Old\"\n\n> Many of Minecraft structures are amazing, and it's always exciting when you encounter one, but sometimes, they can be a bit underwhelming and disappointing. How can existing structures be improved to be more interesting and exciting? Could there be some small tweaks, or a massive overhaul? Alternatively, should the current structures be kept as is and make way for some new and more interesting structures? Get ready to structure your ideas!\n\n> **Monthly Challenges June 2021** (this month, there's four!)\n> \n> 1. Earn the high quality flair on a post (+50 points [limit of 1 post])\n> 2. Include sketches, in game build screenshots, or other art to represent your themed suggestion (+15 points [limit of 3 unique posts])\n> 3. Gain 100 upvotes on one post, best post of the month only counted (+5 points [max 20x])\n> 4. Make a post based on a [discord](https://discord.gg/R37Br7U) prompt (+10 points [Limit of once per prompt])\n\n\n> **Steps to participate:**\n\n> * Your post must be in r/minecraftsuggestions. Your post will also automatically appear in the “monthly-workshop” channel of the [MCS Discord](https://discord.gg/R37Br7U) - we recommend that you join.\n> * Be sure to check the rules before you post\n> * Make sure your post has the [Monthly Theme] flair\n> * Must be posted within the correct month\n\n- - - \n\n#Special Mentions\n\nCongrats to **u/VG_Chat** for being **MVP for the month** thanks to their [2500+ post](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/n9h67d/the_ender_chests_opposite_the_nether_chest/)!\n\nAnd we also have the winner of **last month's Monthly Challenges** (Theme: Arthropods). *Last month's* challenges were:\n\n 1. Get more than 200 upvotes on a monthly theme post (+20 points once, +5 for 50 more upvotes)\n\n 2. Include a concept art, models, or textures of your mob idea in your post (+30 points once) \n\n 3. Come up with a unique idea involving revamping existing mobs or adding a new and challenging one based on the theme of this month (+20 points once) \n\n\nThere are two winners for this month, who are tied with **50 points** - \nthey are u/Chris_The_Alligator (for their [Skullcrab suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/njckxf/skullcrabs_a_new_nether_mob_for_soul_sand_valleys/)) and u/TheTaciturnRogue (for their [Whip Scorpion suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/njxyia/the_whip_scorpion_plus_a_new_block_and_changes_to/)) , from [this post about insect sounds in lush caves](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/nd1efb/insect_sounds_in_lush_caves_such_as_cicadas_and/), placing them pretty high up in the [Top Monthly Challengers leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/wiki/topmonthlychallengers)! \n\n**Great job, suggestors!**\n\n---\n\n#IN OTHER NEWS:\n\n### Moderators\n\nThe mod applications have made a return! If you're interested, check out this post for details: [[LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/nj4yz3/mcs_mod_applications_are_open/)]\n\nAnd talking of moderators, we have one new full moderator (subreddit + discord mod) and one new discord moderator: u/ThatOneKirbyMain2568 (A.K.A. ~~cherry man~~ Microsoft_PowerPoint on the discord), and u/TheDragonWarrior2284 (A.K.A. The Dragon Warrior on the discord)! The former is a subreddit and discord moderator, and the latter is a discord moderator exclusively. They have been trial moderators for the past month and now they have been promoted to the official status of moderator. Feel free to say hi to them if you wish!\n\nAt the same time, we unfortunately saw u/MrOzone2020 step down from moderator for personal reasons this month. But do not fear: he's still very much active on the discord, so he's still available to talk to.\n\n### Custom Awards\n\nYep, we've finally added some custom awards that you can give out to your favourite suggestions! (though unfortunately only if you have enough coins - they cost the minimum possible amount of 500 coins). If you're on the discord, you might recognise some of these fishy friends...\n\nThe custom awards we've decided on are as follows:\n\n- Poggerfish\n- PufferSax (puffer holding saxophone)\n- Well Crafted Idea (a crafting table)\n- Emerald\n- Nether Star\n\nTo hand these out, click on the \"Give Award\" button under the post, go to the \"Community\" tab and choose an award.\n\nWe'd also like to hear your feedback on these. What are your thoughts on these awards? Do you think there could be more awards? Should we set up a moderator-only award to give for the best posts? Let us know in the comments below!\n\n\n### This month's wiki changes:\n\nQuite a big chunk of FPS changes this month:\n\n**[FPS](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/wiki/fps):**\n\n* Adjustable light blocks and/or invisible light source block (partially implemented in Bedrock Edition as light blocks obtained using /give) [implemented, so removed]\n\n* Some way to transfer enchantments, **or choose specific enchantments** (e.g.: a grindstone or new block that takes enchantments from armor/weapons/tools and puts them onto books).\n\n* **Chocolate** or chocolate milk/cake (cocoa beans + milk/cake)\n\n* Shooting stars\n\nAs well as that, there's also a new **Hot Topics** section for ideas that are frequent due to recent snapshots/news, but may or may not stay on the list depending on whether it dies down. The following points were moved to this category:\n\n * Smelting raw ore blocks\n\n * Scoped bows/crossbows\n\n * Torch arrows, or making spectral arrows emit light\n \n * Glowing ink/dye used to craft glow stick/coloured lamps etc.\n\n * “Stealth” enchantment/potion or feather falling/slow falling reduces/cancels player noise, making it harder to be noticed by the Warden\n\n * Wardens get stunned by any source of sound, such as jukeboxes, TNT, fireworks, bats, etc.\n\nAnd now for another reminder for everyone, [please read the FPS List before making any suggestions just to be sure that your idea hasn't already been covered or posted frequently in the past.](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/wiki/fps) \n**Also, if you have a Discord account, we'd also like to invite you over to our [official MCS Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/R37Br7U) if you ever feel like doing some real-time brainstorming.** Or, you know, just put up some memes, we have those too (just keep them SFW and in the proper channels. ;)\n\n\n####***[KEEP IT UP, FELLOW SUGGESTORS!](https://media2.giphy.com/media/GCvktC0KFy9l6/giphy.gif?cid=790b76115d084e896473347132b2c06e&rid=giphy.gif)***\n\n---\n\n#♦️ Beautiful Suggestions 200 and Beyond ♦️\n\nIf there was a suggestion that was missed, please let us know below. Despite our best efforts, we haven't yet reached infallible perfection (we're still trying, impossible as it might be), so some mistakes are still within the realm of possibility.\n\n* [**2500✨** The Ender Chest's Opposite: The Nether Chest](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/n9h67d/the_ender_chests_opposite_the_nether_chest/)\n* [**2500✨** If you buy a wandering trader's whole stock, he moves in and becomes a villager.](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/nf8edj/if_you_buy_a_wandering_traders_whole_stock_he/)\n* [**2400✨** Candles could be used as an alternative recipe for lanterns](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/n3s1ft/candles_could_be_used_as_an_alternative_recipe/)\n* [**2300✨** Beacon Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/n6t91f/beacon_update/)\n* [**2300✨** When you die in nether over a netherrack block this block should be replaced for a soul sand block](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/n39ar5/when_you_die_in_nether_over_a_netherrack_block/)\n* [**2300✨** Arrows shot by bows with the Flame enchantment should activate Nether portals](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/nj73jk/arrows_shot_by_bows_with_the_flame_enchantment/)\n* [**2200✨** make slimes dyeable like sheeps.](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/ndm0a2/make_slimes_dyeable_like_sheeps/)\n* [**2200✨** If a crop is fully grown, passive mobs will eat its top layer, if the crop's type is their breeding food](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/n4pizl/if_a_crop_is_fully_grown_passive_mobs_will_eat/)\n* [**2100✨** Axolotls should NOT attack glow squids](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/nbiabh/axolotls_should_not_attack_glow_squids/)\n* [**2100✨** Villager kids should play in the snow](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/nct3yu/villager_kids_should_play_in_the_snow/)\n* [**2000✨** /enchant should let you apply normally incompatible enchantments.](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/nbxui9/enchant_should_let_you_apply_normally/)\n* [**1900✨** Hydrothermal Vents](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/n771ev/hydrothermal_vents/)\n* [**1900✨** Shooting stars at night.](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/nlcq74/shooting_stars_at_night/)\n* [**1900✨** You should be able to bucket baby striders, but using a lava bucket instead of a water bucket](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/njvx7w/you_should_be_able_to_bucket_baby_striders_but/)\n* [**1800✨** A way to write item lore without commands](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/nani47/a_way_to_write_item_lore_without_commands/)\n* [**1800✨** Player need eat cake to complete “A Balanced Diet”](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/ng1ae2/player_need_eat_cake_to_complete_a_balanced_diet/)\n* [**1700✨** Worn out Roads Seemingly Leading Nowhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/nafek1/worn_out_roads_seemingly_leading_nowhere/)\n* [**1700✨** standard galactic alphabet should be a language option](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/nkfjm9/standard_galactic_alphabet_should_be_a_language/)\n* [**1600✨** Petition to make off-hand slot line up with the inventory slots](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/nh63f7/petition_to_make_offhand_slot_line_up_with_the/)\n* [**1600✨** The Atlas -

I used lemon juice for acid as I was out of citric acid powder. I brought some water to a simmer with a little Sour Apple, Radioactive (which is UV reactive - see pic #4), and Mustard Yellow dye to the water, added some lemon juice, and then let her soak until the dye partially exhausted. It's been a while since I've dyed but I definitely added too much dye to the water. Normally, if I add the proper ratio, the dye bags would exhaust and I'd end up with almost clear water. I washed the hair with warm water and synthropol (a soap that binds to free dye molecules so they wash out and the dye doesn't bleed when wet at a later date). \n\nI love how it turned out! 😍",

Here's specific comment by /u/boylookingfordaddy that I found especially helpful: \n\n\"For the place I used to work at, as far as sauces go, you need to make sure that you have a base down: sugar, oyster sauce, salt, msg, and garlic (and either potato or corn starch). Depending on whether its brown or garlic depends on how much you need of either sugar or salt, as brown is more salty and garlic is sweet. You also need to add WATER, at least half needs to be water, sautee and then boil a few star anise, some ginger slices, carrot slices, and celery to flavor the water. then strain the water into the sauce and mix, let cool, and before serving add a bit of whicever starch you are using to the sauce as you are heating it up, if you dont the sauce will be to thin and wont coat the veggies and meat. (Pro-Tip: to get that bright red color in garlic sauce, you need tomato shade)\n\nNow for the lo mein noddles, we dont make ours personally but we buy bags of lo mein noodles uncooked, and boil them in water in a big wok, then we drain them when they are tender and add a bit of oil to them. \n\nFried rice: about 5-6 pints of long grain rice (for a full pot of rice in a commercial cooker) Wash the rice once, fill to the 20 cup line. Add 7 tablespoons msg and salt, 3 tablespoons of sugar, Few shakes of white pepper, some vegetable oil, put in the rice cooker after mixing in seasoning, then add some thick soy sauce, (probably same as the dark soy you use OP), then add some yellow dye for the color, You need to be pretty heavy handed in the soy and shading, if not the color of your rice will look like pee and not like dark yellow, delicious fried rice. \n\nand finally chicken wings, not very special, same seasoning as rice, salt sugar msg, and white pepper, let that marinade for a little while with some water, then add flour to coat and then fry. \n\nHope I helped out! \n\nAnd super sorry for the shitty ass grammar.\" \n\n\nOriginal comment and post : \nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/askculinary/comments/2d489i/an_important_discussion_about_chinese_food/cjlzvgo",

    "body": "This happened in 2004, I was 23 at the time. My wife and I had just moved to Alabama and we were staying with my Mother while going through the final stages of the hiring process and looking for a place to live. We had 3 dogs, yellow labs all of them.\n\nOne evening I was sitting on the floor playing with our oldest dog when he jumped up to grab a baseball cap I had on, at the same moment I leaned over to grab him. He missed and instead of grabbing the bill of the cap he bit down on my left eyeball. It was very sudden and we more or less bumped heads so from my end I didn't even know what happened at first, all I felt was *Bonk* BLINDING PAIN.\n\nThe first sensation was intense stabbing pain in my eye, the kind of intensity that immediately tells you something is bad wrong and dumps a double shot of adrenaline into your system, which combined with the shock of the moment confused me a lot. I could see, but my vision was uneven and splotchy, kind of like trying to look through wadded up cellophane. I blinked and the pain went from excruciating to mind shattering. I could FEEL the skin of my eyeball lose against my eye, but in the moment I thought it was something else ON my eye, something I MUST wash out NOW. I also started screaming at this point.\n\nMy wife helped me up and to the kitchen, I put my head under the sink and ran water across my face. When I opened my eye again the water flowed across and finished ripping my cornea the rest of the way off the surface of my eye. The pain was so strong I vomited and collapsed to the floor, I didn't black out but I couldn't stand up. This is the point when everyone decided it was time to go to the ER.\n\nYou have to understand what the pain is like. Its unique. Normally when you cut your arm you can put pressure or pinch or rub and generally distract your body from the pain. This isn't like that. This was more like a tooth ache in how no matter what you did, no matter how you moved, the pain stayed with you. Only it wasn't an ache, it was razor sharp, imagine how you feel when you get something stuck in your eye, now imagine that across the whole surface of your eye, now imagine it to the greatest intensity you can, it was worse than that.\n\nOne of the first things I realized was that any pressure against my eye or any movement of my eye would cause the pain to go from a 10 to FuckYou. ANY pressure. ANY movement. I tried to close my left eye and see with my right, but the pressure from the clenched eyelid alone was enough to make me scream and vomit. So before we even made it to the hospital I had decided to wrap both eyes closed, lightly, so I could keep them closed, lightly, and wouldn't be tempted to move my eyes to look in another direction.\n\nThe ER was mostly empty and we didn't have to wait long. The doctor quickly put drops in the eye which completely numbed the pain and I could open it and look around. At this point I could see normally, there wasn't anything obstructing the vision like before I washed it out. The Doc put a yellow dye in my eye so he could see the scratches to the cornea. His first reaction was \"Jeez its the size of Australia.\" He tells me that basically its been ripped off pretty cleanly and the hole is more or less the size of my iris.\n\nThe Doc says that the cornea is one of the fastest healing tissues of the body and that as long as it stays clean and isn't infected it should grow back to normal on its own without any loss to my vision. He gave me an antibiotic drop, a saline drop, and a pain killer, he then tells me the pain killer is toxic and using it will prevent the cornea from healing, so if I used it to kill the pain it would hurt for that much longer. WTF indeed. He said it will continue hurting like this for about two weeks, then it would be a month until my vision was back to normal. He was wrong.\n\nAs we are leaving the ER nurse tells me that cornea pain is worse than childbirth, that it is quite possibly one of the worst pains you can experience.\n\nI decide to keep my plan of keeping both eyes wrapped up. The pain is constant and unrelenting, oral pain killers do nothing. Four times a day I have to open the eye so I can put the antibiotic drops in, it is truly torture, the first week or so my wife has to basically hold me down and put the drops in because the instinct to close the eye is too great. I use the pain killer sparingly, maybe once a day, as the pain becomes too great.\n\nIt takes 3 months before I can stand to open my good eye through the pain. So for 3 months I live as if I was blind, with both eyes wrapped and closed. It wasn't as hard as I expected it to be, but that may be because of the pain, my first instinct was to keep the pain as light as possible at all times, so I didn't so much care about not seeing, sight wasn't my highest priority.\n\nTo keep myself entertained I listened to DVDs. I had recently inherited my late father's 400+ title movie collection. So I went about listening to movies I had already seen. In my mind's eye I could see the films from memory, but with only listening to them there was a lot that I hadn't noticed before. I know everyone knows Star Wars has great sound direction, but if you haven't listened to it with your eyes closed, you need too, it is a whole other experience.\nIf any of you ever lose your sight and need help adjusting in those first few months. Listen to movies, listen to movies you know and love, your imagination will let you see them and it will give you a familiarity in a very unfamiliar world.\n\nSo for 3 months I was totally blind. By the 4th month the pain had abated enough to open my right (good) eye for short periods of time. The pain also went from being a knife like staccato, to more of a roiling ache which would build up the more I tried to use my good eye. By the end of the 4th month I could start to open and use my left (bad) eye.\n\nIn the 5th month my vision in my bad eye was like looking through wax paper. You couldn't see anything at all, not even color unless it was an inch from my face. It was just 100% milky blur. Slowly across the span of the month it came back to being just fuzzy vision, which introduced a whole new problem.\n\nI would get motion sickness from my own depth perception. My brain would try to mesh the fuzzy vision with the good and it ended up having a real nausiating effect, almost like really bad 3d glasses. My depth perception was horrible, things would look like they were right in front of me, but would be 6 feet away. This lasted for about 3 weeks.\n\nBy the 6th month my vision was back to normal and the pain was gone. But that is when the residual problem started.\nIt seems almost like the cornea on my left eye isn't stuck to my eyeball very well. So if my eye dries out too much over night, it can stick to my eyelid, then when I wake up and open my eyes, I end up tearing it again (to a much lesser extent). This causes pain and irritation for a day or two, sometimes it hurts VERY badly.\n\nThis used to happen about once a month, now it only happens about once a year. Today is one of those days, this is the first time its happened this year and it is annoying as fuck. That is what finally convinced me to write this AMA. I woke up about 3am to my eye screaming at me, then spent a few hours putting in eye drops and making sure there wasn't any dirt or anything in there before giving up. If the original pain was an 11 and \"normal\" pain a 5, this is about a 3. Only enough to be extremely annoying and get in the way of daily life.\n\nThat's my story of how I had my cornea ripped off. I would never wish it on anyone ever. I'm lucky I didn't lose my vision. Today I have 20/20 vision and no need for glasses or contacts, there is no noticeable artifacts or scaring in my field of vision.\n\n[Here is the link to the AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/jbhwl/iama_person_who_had_their_cornea_ripped_off/)\n\n**EDIT 1:  Finance**\n\nWe got lucky, I guess, or as lucky as you can get and almost lose an eye.\n\nWe had just moved into town and were staying with my mom. I was at the start of a hiring process, still doing interviews with a company, my wife had just been hired.\n\nMy mom was great and let us stay there the whole time. My wife worked.\n\nMy job process basically froze. I had to delay the interviews. They were good about it and said I could continue the process when I was healed but they made it more or less clear that I couldn't fill the position without my sight. It worked to my favor also because they had a EXTREMELY long hiring process, so while I may have postponed one or two interviews, I still more or less fit into their time table. I wasn't getting a specific position and I wasn't cherry picked, I was basically off the street and they wanted me but didn't know where to put me. So the situation worked out.\n\nBy the 5th month when I could open both eyes but only \"see\" out of the good one, I finished the final interviews, which was kind of awkward because I was in my dizzy spell and couldn't drive.\n\nIt was the 6th month when I started and I was pretty much 100% by the first day.\n\nWe also stayed home the whole time. Or at least I did. So there wasn't much in the way of expenses. We didn't even have a car loan at that point. Everything my wife made went to help with groceries for the family or to savings so we could move out ASAP.\n\nIts also worth mentioning that since we weren't working, we didn't have insurance.  It took us 5 years to pay off the hospital bills and even those were minimal because it was only 1 visit from the doc and a 'script write. ",

Now I know you're arching a brow. (Such a show off, most of us have never had eyebrows.) Humans are responsible for most of every calamity that has ever befallen any of the Ten thousand sentient planets, a number that grows by three planets every million years or so. As the saying goes in the planet Gothra, found North of the three star nebula. \"The difference between good and bad luck is whether or not you're in the presence of the Earth ape.\"\n\nI didn't want to do this. I didn't want to write about humans because just thinking about your scale-less bodies, oval eyes and unending mucus makes me want to barf. An impossible thing to do, barfing, since I long ago evolved beyond the need for a physical body. Now you're wondering how I identify as a lizard if I have no body? That's the problem with humans. Always wondering and seeking an identity. For the rest of us life is easy. We eat, sleep, breed, shit and occasionally commit suicide. Humans on the other hand  need to know the 'how' and the 'why' of things, seeking an identity and if lacking one, inventing one of  their own. No wonder humans almost wiped themselves out during the nipple wars of 10005 A.C (After Cybernetic) When humans with three nipples sought to wipe out those with two, claiming them a hindrance to full evolution.\n\nTo make you understand my purpose for writing this, I'll need to tell my tale from the beginning. Now I know this is a prologue but what I shall disclose here will occur somewhere in future chapters and not before. Hence taking the human word 'Prologue' and shitting on it just as how the Second Expansion humans converted planet CIPO900 into their personal waste deposit planet. Simply because they deduced that the inhabitants of said planet fed on waste, they didn't, the poor creatures didn't know how to get rid of all the waste and since they excreted not through solid matter but gas, they just kept eating the shit dumped on them and farting it away. They eventually evolved to become dependant on actual human waste. Sigh, do not let me get into the whole Fecal wars of planet CIPO900. It's too sad a tale and this book isn't about them and their begging for poop. \n\nNow, about me, I was once a humble lizard- Stop imagining me being human sized, urgh, does everything have to relate to you? I was a lizard. A half a foot long lizard, basking on a rock. That's what lizards did, we lay on rocks  and enjoyed our existence without the need for comprehending it. My scales were green, except for those about the crown of my head that were golden. My planet had two suns, one that was very far away and was always fixed on the sky and another that was close but ringed with debri so it seemed to have a dark stain to its midriff. I did not know what a sun was then but I enjoyed the warmth they brought. I was happy and not much hungry since I'd just come from devouring my father's carcass. (Yes we ate each other, what do you want us to do while hungry? Judgmental bastards. Oh.. So you're saying your species has never fed on itself? Thought so.)\n\nSo there I was, a lizard on a rock. In a planet without a name for it had no sentience or valuable resources hence didn't capture the attention of the Three Star Galactic Empire. The only other species my kind had encountered were birds that came to lay eggs in the crannies of our rocks. We loved feasting on those eggs so we were always excited when we saw those purple feathered creatures flock to our basking spots.\n\nThis one particular day I basked with my tongue slithering in and out of my mouth, the urge to mate overwhelmed all my bodily functions and a frustration I couldn't quite understand at the time that stemmed from the fact that I had the shortest tail among all males (A characteristic that made me the least desirable male to all females) plagued whatever tranquil warmth offered by the two suns of my home planet.\n\nAs bad luck would have it, on this particular day I sat alone at the basking rocks. Majority of my fellow species were mating in dens and I hadn't found any female willing to participate in the act with me. (I'm not an incel, okay? Just because nobody wants to have sex with me despite me wanting to have sex with someone doesn't make me an incel. It just makes me an involuntary virgin. I identify as an involuntary virgin.)\n\nSuddenly, there was a sound behind me that I'd never heard before. Like the fabric of space itself was being ripped apart and out of the dark hole that sharply contrasted with the daylight emerged three men. I could see them with my 360° vision. The shortest of the three who looked like a hobo in dirty brown clothing approached me at my rock where I sat frozen, too confused by the emergence of beings I had no inkling of. Not knowing how to process what was going on.\n\n\"Fella, tell me, do you want to expand your consciousness? Do you want to see with new eyes and feel things you've never felt before?\" The short man with pale skin and rusty red hair asked.\n\n\"Leave the lizard alone, Honey Badger. We need somewhere to - Hey! Don't give it the pill! Don't! Honey! Don't! Aaaaargh Fuck, you gave it the pill! Aaaaargh, that was our last hope! The last thing we could barter with for our freedom and Earth's salvation! You drunk fuck! You've killed us all!\" A lanky man of dark skin who wore a blue shirt complete with an ugly yellow tie with red spots said while shaking his fists at the sky. \n\nThe short man who'd been called Honey Badger had forced my jaw open and dropped a glowing blue pill in then proceeded to clasp his hand around my snout, tilt my neck up and laugh as the pill made its way down my gullet. In his other hand he held a bottle half full with brown liquid, he tilted his head back and took several gulps, then he forced my mouth open once more and filled it with the bitter burning liquid. \n\nThe third member of the trio approached me, I couldn't see his features well as the pill's effects made my vision fragment but I could tell he was larger than the pair. \"Honey, Tweek is right. We should have used that pill to get out of this mess. And are you sure you should have mixed whiskey with that pill? That lizard looks like it's dying.\" \n\nThe hobo laughed. \"Relax, Juice. The only thing I'm sure of is we just made the biggest mistake of our lives and are therefore doomed to wander the cosmos with knowledge of the fact that we brought about the extinction of the human race. Heck! Every race on Earth! Haha! Damn, where will I get whiskey from now?\"\n\n\"You're the one who urged us to fuck them!\" The one in the hideous tie said, Tweek, while placing a shaky dark palm over his eyes.\n\n\"Enough!\" Juice said, his deep voice bounced around my skull and a clarity came to my sight, the fragments came together, forced together by his deep voice. I could see Juice. he wore a blue T-shirt with dark pants. His skin was copper and his hair jet black. His towering height and larger build made him dwarf his two companions. Darkness crept into the corners of my eyes and their words started to become faint with every utterance. \"We all messed up, we thought we'd have a decent night out. Drinks and stories but in the end we ended up having sex with Alien royalty, they looked human so-\"\n\n\"We never believed them.\" Tweek said. \"They kept telling us that their suitors will destroy our planet if we even touched them. We ignored their warnings, taking it for some mass form of insaniy.\"\n\n\"They were insanely hot women though.\" Juice said. \n\n\"True dat.\" Honey Badger said and Tweek nodded. \n\n\"Sucks about the destruction of earth, who'd have thought the word would end in 2023? God what will we eat here? I'm starv-\" \n\nSound twisted itself and I couldn't differentiate it from taste and smell. I came back to my senses upon the rock, but my senses weren't the same. I realised this because of the fact that I could realise something. Normally I had gone through life sitting on a rock, waiting to get laid. I forgot things, couldn't even see my pattern. My species only needs to eat once in an Earthly year. And in that period a lot of us die. So we just sit, breed, birth and bask on rocks, waiting for the weakest to collapse so we can feed on them. The high humidity of our planet meant we didn't drink water, our skin just absorbed it from the atmosphere. So a lot of the time you're just sitting, waiting to die. A simple life, a good life. No comprehending anything other than the fact that I wasn't getting laid because of my short tail. That didn't even bother me much because I didn't even understand what such a thing as 'bother' meant. \n\nBut now I could see with new eyes and feel things I've never felt before. I could connect dots, see patterns and a spark lit within my mind. \n\nI had an idea. My first idea. An idea that would change the direction my species was heading towards for millions of years to come. I crawled off the rock and dragged my slithering form to where my father's carcass lay. Even the bones were gone but none could eat the tail, too hard for the teeth to crack and indigestible if swallowed whole. I dragged his tail between my teeth to a tree that leaked sap that glued anything to the tree for its slow consumption by the plant. I looked around for a leaf of the same pigment as me and My father's tails. I spotted some on a bush and crawled to it, biting one large one off, I took the leaf to the tree's sticky sap. Rubbed it over it, then took the leaf and lay it flat on the ground. I then dragged my father's tail severed end onto the leaf, crawled to the other side and put my tail end to my father's severed end. \n\nI rolled my body, flailing my limbs and digging faster into the ground, friction driving me into a wild spin. The leaf curled around me and my father's tail with the help of the tree sap glue. I inspected my work and found it pleasing to my eyes. It looked like I had thrice the size of the largest male's tail. The two tails bound neatly together with the sap smeared leaf. \n\nI went back to my rock and sat staring up at the suns. I noticed that the larger sun dipped slowly towards the horizon and I just knew that when it vanished a dimness will envelop the land as the distant smaller sun's luminous glow will be the only available source of light. After a while the larger of the suns will rise again and things will brighten once more. The first female approached me as I studied the sky, backing her behind at me and raising her tail, an invitation to have her. \n\nAs I was thrusting within her, four more females approached with raised tails. I found it odd for such a thing was rare but I also felt overjoyed. Within one dimming and brightening of the sky the rocks all around were filled with females numbering in the hundreds, all with raised tails and behinds facing me. The males gathered on a distant rock, croaking and chattering their teeth and watched as I mounted female after female. \n\nI mated for a very long time. Too long a time, I started becoming aware of things, like a lack of interest with the whole mating thing. I turned to face the suns and ignored the females, they slithered away and returned occasionally to stir my interest but to little or no success. To the extent where they even killed and brought me a carcass to feed on in return for giving them my seed. I only occasionally gave in, but most of the time I faced the suns, watching the larger one dip and rise within the horizon. \n\nSomething stirred within me, a wearyness about the whole awareness thing. The females saw what they sought, and I'd used that to draw them in. I fashioned a lie that they believed in for it was what they sought. I had spilled my seed within thousands and still they came. I no longer felt the lure of the mating thing and during my idle lounge upon the rock, surrounded by females, I felt angry. \n\nI had had one thing, one thing only and it had been simple. I bask in the sun, eat my fellow dead lizards and hope to get laid. Then three goddamn fucking humans came and changed all that for me. Now as I observed the distant horizon I found myself questioning things, like why we never leave the rocks or whether other creatures tasted better than our own flesh. A complexity assailed my being, mingling and eroding the simplicity I'd known for so long. Fucking humans! \n\nWhat's worse, two of the humans came back. Stepping out of a sudden rip in space to find me surrounded by females and numerous carcasses of their offerings all around me together with egg shells from the stolen bird eggs that had also been made into  offerings. The hobo was a hobo no more. I recognized him because of his red beard and freckled pale white face, and the smile he gave me. He wore metal I'd later learn was called 'Gold tears' fashioned from a star made liquid. A suit of armor capable of enabling a being to walk on a sun. \n\n\"Well stick a feather up my ass and tickle my heart, its the lizard!\" Honey Badger said. \n\nThe lanky dark skinned man approached but he was lanky no more. He wore a suit of armor known as the 'Mechanic's kiss.' A suit that merged with one's flesh, fed off it and enhanced every aspect of one's body. It was worn only by those who'd pledged their lives to war. His armor was black save for a yellow dye with red spots fashioned around the neck that dropped down his torso in the mimic of a tie. Tweek observed me and Honey Badger looked up at him with a waiting smile. \"Damn it Honey Badger! You just had to fucking give the damn thing whiskey! The liquor ensured the pill's slow digestion, this thing has probably gained sentience by now.\"\n\n\"He is not a thing! His name is Puchpuch and I love the chubby fella, look at all those lizards around him. Lifting their tails to him, he is a conquerer like us!\" Honey Badger said with a laugh. \"Say, how many years have passed on this planet?\" \n\n\n\"A day here is one earth year, so I'm guessing this lizard has seen several thousand earth years. The pill must have augmented it biologically, enabling it to live longer and feed less.\" Tweek said. They paused for what seemed a long moment, Honey Badger smiled at me and Tweek just stared with a blank look. \"And mate more. Fuck, it just might work.\" Tweek said after a while. \n\n\"We conquered Galactic Empires, Tweek, we always find a way.\" Honey nodded at me. \"Juice will love this, Puchpuch is the key!\" Honey Badger said with a laugh. He approached me, his Golden tear armor made not a sound as he moved. The other lizards scattered but I didn't move. I waited for him to get close so I could bite him though it was to little success provided his armor can't be pierced by a lizard's teeth. He picked me up and the pair walked towards the tear in space.\n\n The fucking humans kidnapped me from my home world! Was there consent? For a species that coined the word they sure do know how to ignore it. \n\nThe pair took me and led me to what I can only describe as a life of suffering complete with a gruesome death. \n\nYes. I died. \n\nHow am I writing this then? There you go again being human. After I left my planet, majority of the females I'd mated with gave life to my offspring. Offspring who also carried with them whatever it was that had expanded my consciousness. Evolution went beyond just tying two tails together. As the majority gained sentience and became aware of consciousness the smarter lizards of my offspring kept finding new means to enable them to breed more, hence giving rise to more offspring with the expanded consciousness. \n\nFive hundred million years later and our species ruled the planet, venturing into every ecosystem and taking over it with the recognition that our weapon of power wasn't the size of our tails but the power of our minds. We domesticated every other creature, created a system where they existed to serve our needs. We evolved to the point where we held wars and had invented various ways of destroying ourselves and also preserving ourselves. Five hundred million years later and the awareness of our expanded consciousness made us long to conjoin and become one. Abandon our bodies and exist purely as what you may call a 'Soul' but is actually just a seven dimensional state. \n\nConjoining into the seven dimension took the 'us' of the whole lizard populace and made it into 'me.' Doing so unlocked genetic memory and the history of my entire identity became available to me in all its forms. This destroyed the ability to perceive time for I saw the past as the present and could determine the future in a collective accuracy that ensured even the future was the present to me. This also made me aware of other seven dimensional beings all through the galaxies, those who'd ascended beyond everything and through our connection that went beyond the vacuum of space, we shared existence itself. \n\nAnd let me be frank with you, all of us Celestial beings (That's what we call beings who exist purely in the seven dimension I.e the highest state of consciousness.) We agreed on two things, the first is that humans are generally such a horrible species. The second is that the tale of the three human men who'd given my species its sentience should be told. Only to remind the universe that anomalies existed, even within something as horrible as humans. And to ensure humans of the third expansion know this fact. That's you by the way, you're a human of the third expansion. Though you're yet to expand into space. What? You thought you're the first kind of your race? Haha. Two of your previous generations have already left the planet Earth and terraformed other planets. Your generation is yet to discover how it's done and frankly the other two generations keep you guys in the dark simply because they think you're too backward and they also sort of use your planet like a zoo to see the horrendous place they've come from. See, in the grand scheme of things you're all assholes, all three generations of you.",

Recently I noticed that the shorts started looking yellow in some spots - it was really gross looking. I thought it was from my sweat, but my wife noticed that all the yellow color was in the areas where the shorts were stitched. We determined that the stitching must have some yellow dye that leaked out into the white fabric in the wash.\n\nI opened a support issue describing the problem and sent several pictures. Defects happen, and I figured a company charging $70 for shorts would probably value a loyal customer enough to make it right. In the meantime, I bought 3 more pairs because I couldn’t wear the yellow ones anymore. I spent 4 months going back and forth with the “product educators” who took 3+ weeks to reply to each of my messages. After about 4 back and forth emails, they offered me a 20% discount code on a purchase to replace the shorts. I told them that I already replaced the shorts and asked if they could retroactively apply the coupon to my purchase. Nope. This is what really got me. They told me they’re unable to apply this coupon to an existing order. They took 4 months to resolve my issue, and their resolution didn’t even help me.\n\nI had a “feedback-only” call with one of their support staff and she told me that lulu changed their policies back in December, and now they’re having a lot of these calls with upset customers. It’s a shame because I generally like their products. This is no longer a luxury brand, yet they are still charging luxury prices.\n\nDoes anyone have recommendations for other brands that offer comparable men’s yoga shorts?",

    "body": "TLDR: Didn't know anything about beeswax and bought from Amazon. Turned out to be fake wax. Pic at bottom.\n\n# Beware of Amazon Beeswax!\n\nI bought two pounds of beeswax from amazon recently to make some candles for my UCO candle lantern (replacements are crazy expensive). I had never bought beeswax before so I did not know what to expect. I thought I found a really good deal. I really felt I had found real beeswax.\n\n**The sellers claimed:**\n\n* 100% Pure Natural.  From our centennial bee farm, our beeswax pellets are cosmetic grade, all-natural organic and triple-filtered. pesticide free, chemicals free, nontoxic, and cruelty free.\n* Made without additives or synthetic ingredients, our yellow beeswax pellets maintain their natural, sweet, refreshing scent of honey.\n* Smokeless\n\n   Between their 3, 4, and 5-star reviews they had almost 80% approval rating. These points were enough to sell me on it. Boy, was I wrong.\n\n   I made some candles using the Amazon wax. When burn testing, they burned extremely fast for \"beeswax\" and ended up producing a huge flame with smoke/soot. Not safe at all to burn in a tent all night. I had calibrated everything correctly and was unsure where I went wrong.\n\n   I ended up finding someone local who was selling beeswax candles they made.  I asked them where they got their wax and what they though about my problem. They hooked me up with their supplier and I ended up buying 2 more pounds locally.\n\n   What a difference! The wax came in solid blocks and smelled amazing! It was sweet/honey/flower smell and was slightly sticky to the touch. When melted it turned a much darker amber. After making a few candles with it, it was time for the burn test - start to finish. I made the candles the exact same way as I did with the Amazon wax. They passed the test with flying colors: flames stayed consistent and never over 3\". Burned slow and without soot/smoke. No weird plastic/rubber smell. I was happy and now safe to use them in a tent for extended periods of time.\n\n**Some key points about the Amazon fake beeswax:**\n\n* You can see the yellow dye rubbed off all over interior of the bag.\n* Almost a bright neon yellow in color.\n* It's made in China.\n* It's very cheap.\n* There is no honey/sweet/flower smell. It smells like plastic/rubber.\n* When melted is not a dark color. Maintains same color as when in pellet form whereas real wax turns darker when melted.\n* Could not find a website for the company selling the wax.\n* Could not find any information on where the wax was harvested.\n* Zero certification labels on the bag.\n* Nearly 20% of the 1-star reviews come from experienced candle makers all saying the same thing - it's fake. This is what clued me into my problem.\n\n**About some of the 1-star Amazon reviews:**\n\n* One reviewer had been a professional Aromatics Compounder for decades, using beeswax for their Biblical Skincare products online. They had to order fast and did not have time to get any from their normal supplier.  The wax did not blend in their commercial equipment and as for turning it into cream it just remained a separated liquid.\n* One reviewer said: *\"This is probably the furthest thing from beeswax I’ve ever seen. It looks like plastic, it smells like plastic! And much to my curiosity….YEP it even tastes like plastic. I would not only recommend you not purchase this for any reason other than needing plastic but I would recommend Amazon remove this product entirely \"*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pfzr97w3s9pc1.png?width=3144&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad1662cbdfe9c913f9fa0772f54ad0b09be7c34e",

But in the process, I learned a ton, and can do a much better job next time. Here are all the things I learned so you can make a grill cake that looks better than mine.\n\n-Carving and shaping: If you have a bowl to bake the cake in, you're very lucky--use it. If not, to get the round shape, carve the cake AFTER you stack. Several of the how-to videos I watched said to cut the three layers before stacking and filling, and boy, was that advice terrible. Your angles will be MUCH better (and your cake will be more centered) if you carve after stacking.\n\n-Making the grill support: That ring around the top where the grill sits (the part that holds the charcoal) is made from the inch-wide ring of cake that I carved from the bottom layer, so I tried to keep the edge as intact as possible while trimming it off. I needn't have bothered--just take the cake trimmings and turn them into cake pop mix and sculpt it into the ring shape. You could even use fondant.\n\n-Making the grill: The metal grill part was originally made out of fondant. However, fondant that's thick enough to hold weight, like the fake foods, takes much longer to dry than I'd realized. I tried the oven light trick, but it still wasn't fast enough. For something like this, you should leave it in the oven for at least two full days. I only had five hours, which wasn't nearly long enough, so I had to resort to using a chunk of the wire mesh that I keep in my kitchen for cake emergencies (I got it at Home Depot--it's in the gardening section next to the tomato cages. Great for making wire armatures that support cake.)\n\n-Making the charcoal: There's a lot of talk online about how to get the perfect color for the charcoal briquettes inside the grill--black food coloring, silver spray, etc. You don't need any of that. Just take some Oreos, mash 'em up with a dollop of buttercream, and roll them into balls. Stick them in the fridge for a bit to take out the stickiness, and then you can smoosh them into shape. Voila--perfect gray charcoal.\n\n-Hot dog details: When you're making the fondant hot dogs, the key detail is the indentation at the ends. Take a toothpick and press it into both ends to make it look like the ends of a sausage (like a \\*). Then use that toothpick to draw on the grill marks with black food coloring. Also, dying them the right color required more yellow dye than I'd expected. I wonder if you could do this by melting and mixing yellow and pink Starbursts. Might be a good fallback if you run out of fondant.\n\n-Forming the burgers: The burgers are made from cocoa krispie treats, but I've always struggled with shaping those--they're so sticky that I can never get them to hold their form. Instead, take a 1/4 cup measuring cup, spray it liberally with Pam, and pack the krispies in there. Then whack it out onto some baking paper. Spray between each patty.\n\n-Making the corn: Finding the jelly beans for the corn was harder than I expected. If you live in the south, Publix has them year-round, but Kroger doesn't. Using a mixture of all the jelly belly beans that have white or yellow bases will give you a more convincing final product than all beans of the same color. These are on a Little Debbie roll (any roll cake or Twinkie will work). One standard bag of Jelly Belly beans just barely had enough to make the corn convincing, and even then, I had to trim the cake roll down a bit.\n\n-Missing touch: Handles. If I'd had 20 extra minutes, I'd have figured out a way to make handles. Maybe out of marshmallows and toothpicks? Not sure, but I think it needs that to really convey that it's supposed to be a grill.\n\nMay your summer cake decorating experiments be more successful than mine! If you've done a bbq grill cake before, what are your tips?",

You could also allow them to take on the signal strength that a comparator feeds into them (move a block of redstone in front of a comparator, it changes to match the signal strength the comparator is putting out, then you move the block of redstone somewhere else and it retains that signal strength).",

    "body": "The brand:\n\n>Tender Co. was created by William Kroll in the summer of 2009, although its first run of clothing was not until autumn/winter of 2010. Kroll’s designs tend to revolve around the Great British Steam age, but there are certainly vintage American workwear influences in many of his pieces. Tender’s name is derived from the tender of a steam-train, which was the fuel-carrying car directly behind the engine.\n\nThe man behind the brand:\n\n>Kroll began making his own clothing when he was fourteen. He attended an art college where he got a degree in menswear before apprenticing with a bespoke tailor for eighteen months. He worked for a “pretty big jeans brand” before leaving to learn about indigo dying in Kojima in 2009. It was this trip to japan that spurred the start of Tender. [Source.](http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php/topic/98577-tender-co-denim/page-6#entry2124686)\n\nHow it works/one-man-brand analysis:\n\n>Tender is a one-man-brand, but he doesn’t do all the work himself. Rather, he is a brilliant designer who works with artisans to create the best product possible. Some may say that he isn’t a true “one-man-brand” because he doesn’t make everything himself, but this is only half true. No brand does everything. Whether it is buying rivets or buying denim, at some point every brand has outside help. What matters is who the outside help is. Kroll works with only the best, and it shows in his final products.\n\nThe Details:\n\n1. [The Tender Cuff,](http://i.imgur.com/cogz3SM.jpg) [“not to be taken seriously.”](http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php/topic/98577-tender-co-denim/page-18#entry2657759)\n\n1. Rivets: Tender uses domed copper rivets produced by UNIVERSAL Japan®. Domed rivets were chosen for a few reasons: bar tacks are less strong, donut rivets scratch furniture, and Kroll believes that hidden rivets go against the true workwear aesthetic. [Source.](http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php/topic/98577-tender-co-denim/page-6#entry2140092)\n\n1. Reversed inseam inlay: you may have noticed that your jean’s inseam is stacked, with one half of the leg folded and sewn over the other. Tender jeans have reversed the direction of this inlay. This has several structural benefits, such as the inseam not getting caught on bicycle saddles as easily.\n\n1. The fly uses only two buttons, which are vintage Levi reproduction fly buttons. This two-button design was often seen on overalls and can be easily undone while wearing gloves. [Source.](http://vimeo.com/27771897)\n\n1. The pockets and belt loops are lined with selvedge calico from Lancashire. Most of the pocket bags are made of denim.\n\n1. [Snob’s thumb pocket](http://i.imgur.com/xh2o6Ga.jpg): this pocket is about the size of a coin pocket but is placed on the inside of the waistband. The idea was taken from late 18th/early 19th century trousers, where a snob’s pocket was present to keep a watch or place one’s thumb. It also allows the “coin” pocket to be easily accessed when wearing a thick belt or sitting down. [Source.](http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php/topic/98577-tender-co-denim/page-12#entry2345642) \n\n1. Continuous stitching: the idea of continuous stitching is present in many areas of Tender product’s construction. Part of this came from a book on penmanship that Kroll inherited, which talked about the importance of flow and not removing the pen from the page. This concept was translated into stitching; for instance the back snob’s thumb pocket is sewn on with a single continuous stitch, as are the back pockets. [Source.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5on_tb9ETmU&feature=youtu.be)\n\n1. [The logo](http://i.imgur.com/W8AN8H2.jpg): The Tender elephant logo comes from a vintage source book of advertising designs, which was an old way of distributing editable images. The text on the logo could be edited to match any company’s needs. [Source.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5on_tb9ETmU&feature=youtu.be)\n\n1. [The button](http://i.imgur.com/VIMMEu6.jpg): Tender uses [removable buttons](http://i.imgur.com/7Q66fwV.jpg) on their jackets and the waistbands of their jeans. The idea for this came from railway worker’s jackets, which had removable buttons supplied by their employers. The design on this button is known as [Platus](http://i.imgur.com/p6JmVmb.jpg) and comes from the same source image as the Tender elephant. The buttons are created in Devon, using the “lost-wax” method, which is slow and destroys the mold with each casting. This same “lost-wax” method is used to create Tender belt buckles and various other metal pieces used in their products. [Source.](http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php/topic/98577-tender-co-denim/page-7#entry2146581)\n\n1. [Selvedge Inseam, no outseam:](http://i.imgur.com/OFMypvP.jpg) These are from a pair of trousers made in collaboration with For Holding Up the Trousers. Morten V. Kristensen, the man behind For Holding Up the Trousers, used to be an intern for Kroll.\n\n1. Tender also produces [loopwheeled in England tshirts.](http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php/topic/98577-tender-co-denim/page-4#entry2094105) The neck and cuffs on these shirts do not contain any stretchy material, but rather the cuff material is pulled to match the body when sewn. This increases longevity, but is difficult to sew properly. [Source.](http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php/topic/98577-tender-co-denim/page-12#entry2368518)\n\nThe Denim:\n\n>The majority of Tender ‘s jeans are made from an unsanfornized, Japanese selvedge denim. It is a 17oz right hand twill denim, and shrinks considerably more than many other unsanfornized denims (15-20%). [Source.](http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php/topic/98577-tender-co-denim/page-16#entry2633533)\n\nSizing:\n\n>Jeans and jackets are sized as 1 – 5. This was deliberately done to prevent vanity-sizing confusion. Some sizes are regional, such as size 1 being only available in Japan. \n\nJean cuts:\n\n>Note: Many different overdyes are available.

Logwood produces both [purple](http://i.imgur.com/mhElJZl.jpg) and [black](http://i.imgur.com/YM3PM4L.jpg)  tones.\n\nLeather products:\n\n>Their belt leather is sourced from a local British tannery that has been running since the Roman ages. The tannery sources their hides from Devonshire beef cattle and tans with oak bark form Somerset. This oak tanning takes longer than many other forms of tanning, but the resulting leather is magnificent. All the stitching on their belts is done with Tiger thread, which is a “tubular knitted and heavily waxed.” [Source.](http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php/topic/98577-tender-co-denim/page-3#entry2063416)\n\n1.

I do not mean to say that we don't have some very astute cheese tasters/lovers, but these are not your average, everyday Americans. White cheddar and regular cheddar should taste identical. When they don't taste identical, the manufacturer is playing with flavors.  \n  \nThink of it like chocolate. Milk chocolate v. chocolate flavor (you can even go as far as saying \"American chocolate v. British chocolate\") are vastly different in taste, texture, smell, etc.   \n  \nWe've come to expect a muted, creamy flavor from cheddar. Cheddar is meant to be a sharp, hard cheese with a creamy taste (IMO; the cheddar I've eaten in England/Wales is vastly different from the most \"real\" cheddar in the U.S.).  \n  \nMy ex-husband is British and when he came to the U.S. and I put cheddar in front of him, his first question was, \"Why is it yellow?\" The next question was, \"Where can we get regular cheddar?\" His third question was, \"Where can we get English cheddar?\"",

For background, I don't have sensitive skin at all.\n\nI had my bisalp and ablation almost two weeks ago (3/13). I started noticing it around day 4 in a little line of red bumps under my breasts. Very itchy but didn't think anything of it. Fast forward to now and holy shit I am covered on my whole belly and thighs and SUFFERING. The itch is unbelievable. They should really use this as a method of torture omg. I got this with a prior surgery, but thought it was a one off and it wasn't terrible. I had to get a prescription cream from my PCP. Didn't know if it was from the Dermabond glue\n\nThe surgeon said it could be from the cleanser because wherever I was colored orange on my abdomen after surgery, was where the rash is. Very clear lines of red raw rash. They put me on a strong antihistamine that didn't do anything, no cream did anything and I tried two (I'm now on my third). I finally went to a dermatologist last evening and she put me on oral steroids for two weeks and a stronger cream. She could not believe what she was seeing and just kept saying 'omg you poor thing'. She promised that this would knock it out and I'd feel so much better once the prednisone kicks in.\n\nLet me tell you that this was the worst thing about this recovery and it had nothing to do with the procedure at all. The scrub they used was Chloraprep which can cause a reaction to the alcohol, dye, or chlorhexidine in it. I use chlorhexidine every day so it's not that. Alcohol never bothered me either so I'm convinced it's the yellow dye that turned me orange like an oompa loompa. If it doesn't get better PLEASE IM BEGGING YOU see a dermatologist. \n\nI went to my surgery post op today and my  surgeon said this is the worst reaction she's ever seen. She took off some of the surgical glue too. This did not affect the healing or my incisions which is good. She actually wants to see me back in two weeks to make sure this gets better because she said it's really bad. \n\nJust wanted to put that out there for anyone who may or may not have allergic reactions to anything skin related. If you see red bumps or an itchy rash, do not wait. Go get it taken care of ASAP.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk/rant 😂",

What helped was going to urgent care and requesting steroids like prednisone: since your body's immune system is likely going into overdrive and creating the rash, the steroid should calm it down by suppressing the immune overdrive response. I had 5 days on prednisone and it started reversing the rash in about 6 days. They also prescribed a topical cream but I believe the most immediate relief was due to the short term steroid. I didn't bother with antihistamines since the last time I had a medical rash like this, it was the prescribed steroids that helped me the most.\n\nOral steroids take a few days to show results in reducing a rash. The butt injection shot would work faster, like in 24 hours, and if you have it really bad, IV is even faster. I can't imagine an IV needed unless you got a full body rash.",

As the youngest feeds the oldest does the very important task of napping more\n\nAs the foal feeds the mare looks up. She notices the sign listing the building as fluff TV. She remembers in the mil some of the fresh mares in between whining about missing daddeh and being sorry for whatever landed them in trouble would speak of fluff TV. Suddenly a door opens and a woman sprints out grabbing the family. The mare fights back but the woman only places a hand on the neck of the youngest and squeezes till the foal starts struggling to peep for the lost milk. The mare stops fighting to ensure the survival of the children\n\nAs the family is brought deeper into the facility, the mare begins watching for escape routes. The woman enters a room full of tiny bins full of foals yet sorted by color. She sets the brown foal inside the bin of brown foals. The foal crawls over to the teet of the milkbag\n\nThe woman carries the remaining family members into a white wing of the facility. She asks if the people inside can remove the identifying marks from the yellow foal. They respond they might\n\nThe woman takes the mare to cages full of mothers. She opens a empty one and before placing the mare inside she is approached. The man asks the woman if he can have the mare and if she will take the mare he already has to disposal. The woman asks why before being informed that the mare had started arguing for its original foal. The other individual in the room, a new hire that was refilling the food asks why didn't they just give it its foal? The others chuckle stating that foal had died long ago\n\nThe mare is handed to the man and he brings her into a room. He sets her in a pen with some foals. 2 walking and 3 chirps. The walking play silently as the chirps peep hungrily. Upon seeing the mare the walking foals grow even sadder. The chirps however just wander over and feed\n\nShe sits in that strange situation. Being guided to play and feed random foals. She feels disgusted at the strange situation but she puts up with it. Until she is placed with a familiar smelling yellow foal. She recognizes the scent. She plays with its fluff until she notices the roots of its fluff are stained brown. When being brought to her pen she keeps track of the path taken\n\nWhen she arrives to her pen they latch it and leave. She uses her tounge to open the latch. She leaps from the cage causing others to notice and begin begging for help. She runs from the room and hides in the halls from the humans coming to shut up the mares\n\nShe sneaks into the foal pens. She manages to identify her foal via calling for chocolate and sorting from there. She brings her found child to the yellow pens. She calls out for banana. When those few arrived she began grabbing them and dipping them in the water bowl. She keeps going until the yellow dye washes off of her foal\n\nShe takes her foals and makes the yellow keep the youngest quiet. She sneaks past the humans and as she nears the exit she notices the cannibals. She runs up and opens the nearest cage. The cannibal inside considers consuming her before realizing the humans are a better lunch. The cannibal runs over to the other cannibal cages and opens them. The mare takes this as her cue that she properly created a distraction and now can leave.

Still I cannot bring me to like fat boy armor... and there is more to it:\n\nFor me this - like Toussaint armor or many heavy armor pieces you can loot - is not lore compatible. Geralt in the books is using light, leather armor, not a knight´s armor. I also do not like the look from behind, the armor straps around his tights look uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. And I do not like the golden details in the upgraded versions. For me Geralt always looks more or less like a christmas tree in this armor, especially when undyed. A dye like this can therefore only improve the looks of it. (Well, apart from pink. I remember dying my Griffin armor pink once, because I did not intend to wear it ... and in the end I needed it despite everything around the time when I had to collect Uma and go to Kaer Morhen. This was the only time I grinded 2 levels in W3. I could not send Geralt to meet his brothers in pink Griffin armor... no way!) My favorite dye for it is black, though.",

Ocean would have a \"Coral Reef\" variant and Deep Ocean would have a \"Kelp Forest\" biome. \n\nCoral Reefs:\nThe biome would contain a variety of different sea plants of different shapes and colors. They include:\n\n- Purple/Cyan/Orange Coral, used to craft the dyes (based on their color) \n\n- Sea Anemone, a plant that looks like little colorful worms, crafts yellow dye\n\n- Regular/Purple Fluorescent Aqua Plants, give off light and crafted into either purple or cyan dye. \n\n- Starfish and Sand Dollar, both flat (like lily pad) blocks that can be used for decoration (or sponge bob jokes). \n\n- This biome would also generate sponge blocks, because people want them function or not. \n\nKelp Forest:\nA deep ocean variant, which is a dense forest of kelp from 1 to 4 blocks tall (randomized based on a noise pattern). \n\n- Kelp, please refer to my older post on kelp: www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/1m9pnj/kelp_comes_in_patches_or_forests_with_visuals_by/\n\nNow, here's that picture I promised:\nHttp://imgur.com/NUynFtx\n\n(Starfish and Sand Dollar not included because they aren't visible in a 2 dimensional environment, they would be like lily pads, but on the ocean floor)  \n\nSand Dollar: http://imgur.com/Yqd0aQs \n\nStarfish: http://imgur.com/ETJsPxZ\n\nLike the flowers we have now, these blocks would be mostly decorational, and used for dyes.

Reefs form on emerging volcanic islands (or, in the case of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, on continental shelves). As the volcano subsides back into the ocean, the shore moves further from the reef, thus creating a barrier reef and a lagoon; islands with barrier reefs usually don't have sandy beaches. When the volcano completely subsides, the remaining reef forms an atoll. Coral reef dropoffs go about 200m down.\n\nKelp forests usually grow in nutrient rich, colder waters outside the tropics as in [California](http://imgc.allpostersimages.com/images/P-473-488-90/68/6886/EJXJ100Z/posters/ian-shive-chanthe-view-underwater-off-anacapa-island-of-a-kelp-forest.jpg), [Iceland](http://www.fisheries.is/media/skjal/pictures/half/3-Ecosystem-\\(P\\)-Cod_in_kelp_forest--(copyright-Erlendur.B\\).jpg), [South Africa](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_llo65z5h0j1qib1an.jpg), [Northern Japan](http://cdn.lightgalleries.net/4bd5ec0079abc/images/Giant_Kelp_Forest-1.jpg), etc.. The giant kelp that forms kelp forests attaches itself to rocks from 2m-30m deep. Giant kelp can grow about 2m a day and forms large canopies to absorb as much light as possible (sea otters like to hang out in these canopies; I only mention this because sea otters are adorable).\n\nBecause of these differences, I think that both would be best implemented as biomes in their own right with kelp forests generating near \"cold\" biomes and coral reefs generating near \"warm\" biomes. Coral reef biomes could also generate in open ocean as atolls. This would be made even better with aquatic mobs.",

I really really really hope that the folks at Mojang take the time then to squeeze in a couple more robust ocean biomes as you have described.\n\nA few more ocean related terrain things I personally would love to see:\n\n* Rare white and pink sand beaches that spawn near coral reef biomes\n* Underwater \"structures\" including shipwrecks and colonnades of nether quartz pillars and similar sunken ruins.\n* Deep ocean rarities such as thermal vents with a new red glowing lava vent block--think cobblestone with a red hot glow in the cracks. Above this would be a special type of rising \"hot water\" that is simply water with an upward current. Both blocks only available for placement in creative. Surround the area with tube worms similar to your kelp, rising up to 2 squares high.\n* Giant bone formations at the bottom of the deep sea. Dragon ribs? Whales? Sea serpents? Something to add some mystery. These bones would be a special form of \"fencing\" that can be placed above and below water.\n* Sea urchins as another form of seabed \"plant\" life. 1 high kelp and urchins should be scattered about all sea floors, not just in kelp forests.\n* Giant oysters that are reskins of 1x1 chests, open as they do and have a 3x3 storage inside.\n\nAnyways, love your ideas and I think they would go a long way towards making the oceans a MUCH more interesting place to explore in MC.",

    "body": "I originally posted this in r/prorevenge until an awesome officer told me about this subreddit\n\nBackground: This was a snobby high class apartment community in the Southern California Orange Curtain filled with residents and managers who think every problem is balanced by money and anyone else (contractor, service employee, or other) was below them and expendable. As the Security contractor we were expendable, and they made it clear because we were hired to replace the previous contractor that we found out were set up to fail by the same managers that hired us. We weren't hired to provide security so much as for the company to have someone to blame as their liability shield if something went wrong. We did the job as best we could given the hypocritical ethics and practices of our property managers, but we knew the real reason they wanted us.\nThe Conflict: Among the many residents thinking that their high rent entitled them to the right to complain about anything they wanted was one that we will refer to as 4323. He would call in and complain at any hour he wanted, most commonly 15+/- minutes from 10 pm when the pools closed to complain about people in the pool or to tell us how to do our job (the pools close at 10 pm and most of the time he called before that just to say we needed to close them). He would complain we weren't doing out job, didn't do out job, he couldn't sleep because a neighbor was screwing too loudly, all sorts of ridiculous things. He also left his window open which was probably why he supposedly could hear everything and later became his Achilles heel. The property managers offered to move him to a different apartment but he refused because of his view of the pools on the top floor and the managers would always settle because he paid a really high rent anyways. After over a year of this we retaliated.\nConflict resolution/Revenge: The previous month 4323 had called in 3 times a day every day so I told the other security guards to pee in a bucket or contribute something virile and liquefied to the \"gag bag\" every time he called and it would be put to good use after 3 days we had enough. I was still in college as an engineering major at the time and after enough fluid mechanics and hydraulic lab work, I had designed a prototype revenge machine: basically a giant super-soaker with a .5\" nozzle powered by compressed gas (I used a propane tank because it was convenient). As security guards we had access to the roof and I already had a vantage point in mind for. I had a previously calculated set of tables to make the perfect shot, a little bit of trigonometry and a partner to help set up the shot and with the pull of the trigger we sent over a gallon of piss, fish guts, yellow dye, and left over Indian food through the window and onto their rug without even grazing the window edges all while under the cover of night. 4323 apparently didn't have any idea what had happened the following morning, complaining got them nowhere but they got pegged with the cleaning fine because 4323 couldn't prove they didn't make the mess themselves and they were at home at the time (which was even more surprising they did not hear a splash after all the noise complaints they made that year).\n\nIn case I didn't make it clear enough earlier, #4323 didn't complain based of reason, he did it for entertainment probably while going through insomnia. Security weren't the only ones having problems with #4323 but the property managers and other residents as well.\n\nTL;DR: \n-Guy #4323 complains too much too long to security guard \n-security guard uses 'engineering': makes giant putrid filled super-soaker \n-guy #4323 gets fined for cleaning mysterious stinky yellowish stain on rug\n",

    "body": "**TL;DR**  I failed to get the right color, but ended up with equally lovely color.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Intro**\n\nEdit: I'd be remiss to not credit my learning source: u/Neurophil's post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/443ijz/charcoal_dundalks_a_makeover_with_angelus_black/)\n\nI have an overlap of tan roughout boots, so I decided to dye one of them.  I was thinking of Navy dye, but ultimately decided to go for Loden instead.  Definitely influenced by the Loden Jodh GMTOs.  \n\nAngelus or Fiebing does not have 'Loden' dye available, so I have to mix several colors to get there.  [Online search](https://www.quora.com/What-color-combinations-create-the-color-loden) tells me that “a judicious mixture of yellow, black, green and a hint of red” is my starting point to get Loden shade.  I ordered the dyes I needed from Angelus (I can’t remember why I decided to go with Angelus, maybe because of the color variety).  The yellow dye is sold out, so I picked brown instead.\n\nI knew that I’d need a LOT of trial and error to get the right color, so I reached out to one of the members here for leather scraps and he [totally delivered](http://i.imgur.com/gFMPBYq.jpg).  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Supplies:**\n\n* [Angelus suede dye](http://i.imgur.com/pxgl3gr.jpg) (Green, Brown and Red).  Also pictured are the syringes for accurate measurement.  I bought them from Amazon, they come in a pack of 10.\n* [Plastic shot cups for mixing colors](http://i.imgur.com/1gqW577.jpg).\n* [Scrap leather to test the color](http://i.imgur.com/LyFpDcC.jpg).\n* Suede brush (Mine is nylon bristle)\n* Paint brush from dollar store\n* Painter’s tape\n* Old newspaper to catch the stray paint\n* Optional: latex gloves.  I opted against it because I was going for the patina on my hands.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steps involved**\n\n* [Tape the welt](http://i.imgur.com/GXncvQX.jpg) – I used a flathead screwdriver to help reach under the upper.\n* [Test the color on an obscured patch](http://i.imgur.com/w09YsHr.jpg).  Pictured is unmixed color, straight from the bottle.\n* [Mix the dyes to get the desired color](http://i.imgur.com/1gqW577.jpg).  You want to make note of the ratio of each color that you added – the shade in the picture is 4:1:1 (Green, Red, Brown).  \n* [Confirm that the ratio above is correct](http://i.imgur.com/e58smFi.jpg) by mixing another cup.  This is where accurate measurement is important.\n* Use the provided dauber and coat the boots.  I used small paint brush (the kind you use for watercolor) to coat the seams, around the hardware, and near the welts.\n* Let dry and brush to raise the naps.  By this point, any spot you missed during the first coating will show up.\n* Apply second coat and start to regret your foolish decision.  \n* After drying, the leather will feel very dry.  I diluted a dab of Bick 4 in water and brush it onto one of the panels.  It doesn’t seem to do much, so I stopped.\n* Final step: Wear your boots with pride.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nI didn’t get the loden color that I’m after, instead I end up with dark mossy green which works better for my taste.  The shade ranges from [very dark, almost black](http://i.imgur.com/FkXDqiZ.jpg) indoor.  [Greenish blue](http://i.imgur.com/gety3Ac.jpg) when hit with sunlight, and [deep mossy green](http://i.imgur.com/sC7Qe6L.jpg) outdoor.   Would I do this again?  Maybe.  These are rather frustrating mostly because mixing colors is tricky business, but seeing the end result is worth it.\n\n\n",

    "body": "Hi,\n\nI’m in my 50’s, around 75kg and did my first two half marathon races last year in the Saucony pro 3’s (1.49, 1.47). I hope to do another race soon. I tend to pronate a bit, heel to midfoot strike and am a slower runner ranging from 4.40 to 5.45 per km paces. I use a heel insert which gives me extra stability.\n\nI use various shoes for the training - Saucony triumph 20, Saucony speed 3s, and NB SC elite v3, Hoka Mach 6, Asics Novablast 1/3.\n\nLooking for another race day shoe as I have 230km on my Saucony Pro 3s (Size 11) (I do have a newer pair of Saucony’s too – 40% off as back up). I was considering the Asics Edge Paris, Nike Alphafly 3 and Puma NE 3.\n\nRecently went and tried these 3 shoes in the shop on a treadmill and a running track in the store.  \n\n**~Shoe Comparisons~**\n\n**Asics Edge Paris vs Puma**\n\nThe Asics (size 11) was a nice fit, however when running I could feel quite a lot of pronation, and the heel felt very narrow. Heel was quite firm, felt a nice push forward. The Puma however felt more stable for me, softer at the heel, felt a similar but gentler push forward. Puma - sized down to 10.5 felt a better lockdown, felt a little more cushioned and softer all round too.\n\n**Nike Alphafly 3 vs Puma**\n\nNike Alphafly felt bouncy, and loud, felt like it was a little too soft on the heel. Pretty good on straight lines but around corners felt I was collapsing, upper not secure enough. Felt very bouncy but not very smooth. Puma felt more secure for me, grips well around corners. Very smooth heel to toe transition.\n\nSo purchased the Puma.\n\n**~Three Runs in Puma Elite 3 vs Saucony Pro 3’s~**\n\n**~Summary~**\n\n**Initial Run: 8k tempo Run**\n\nTook the Puma for an 8km tempo run. Very smooth, punchy and responsive off the toes, reasonably stable, great lockdown and light. The rocker is very smooth. I ran an average of 4.51 km pace, normally run in the Saucony pro 3’s the same course between 4.54 -5min km pace, so felt was a little faster on the Puma for similar effort. A couple kms I did around 4.40 pace - very impressed.\n\n**Second Run – slower 5km run**\n\nAt 5.24 average pace average one km was at 5.37. It wasn’t clunky still quite smooth but you could tell it wanted to go faster. Heart rate was low so quite efficient. Up hills was fine, down a hill I didn’t find too much instability landing on the heel. Similar versatility to the Saucony pro 3’s, seems slightly easier to run slow in Puma.  \n\n**Third Run – ½ marathon (21km)**\n\nMy first ½ marathon distance in 10 months, so a bit unfit for that distance. Quite humid. In the saucony last week I did 18km run at 5.26 pace. Did 21 km in the Puma today at 5.18 pace. It seemed a little faster and easier at slower paces. Summary: Great lockdown, reasonably stable, bouncy, comfortable and smooth all the way – didn’t lose any pop, toes start to feel it a bit at 17km mark and the midsole did soften a little on the toes area. Puma probably still breaking in.\n\n**Vs the Saucony Pro 3’s for ½ marathon.**\n\nSaucony - I feel has a touch more protection (Wider shoe) but you do feel the plate more.  A little firmer towards the end the run, love the speedroll technology of the Saucony . The Saucony upper is slightly more breathable. The Puma does feel lighter you don’t feel the plate as much, and seems easier to pick up the pace. Puma definitely better and faster (more propulsive at 5-10km distance) and longer. I do love the Saucony Pro 3’s too for ½ marathon.\n\n \n\n**~Summary after 3 Runs (vs Saucony Pro 3)~**\n\n**Upper:**\n\nBreathable (not as much as Saucony pro 3), race fit but plenty of adjustment with laces, the tongue is better than Saucony as a bit of extra padding at the top of the tongue and doesn’t slip down like the Saucony.\n\n**Sizing/Fit/weight**\n\nThe Puma runs a little long and narrow, usually wear size 11, and went for 10.5. If wider feet - maybe true to size.  The Saucony pro 3 (size 11) is wider but has a tighter upper, similar length to the Puma’s size 10.5. Weight Puma 220g vs Saucony 230g. The heel width is 85mm (P) vs 89mm (S). Midfoot considerably narrower on Puma, forefoot slightly narrower. Puma feels lighter, Saucony feels like it’s a bigger and wider shoe which gives you confidence.\n\n**Stability/Feel**\n\nStability a bit better on the Saucony especially at the heel but still pretty good in the Puma. The rocker is slightly more aggressive in the Puma with a more explosive toe off. The plate in the Puma I read is similar to the Asics Edge Paris/Nike vaporfly/Saucony pro 3 – dips down into the forefoot. Puma’s heel is fairly soft.\n\n**Midsole:**\n\nA nice balance between soft and firm, the heel is softer than forefoot. Your feet feel flat while walking and more unstable at the heel but when running stability improved. You can feel the rocker and plate assist you moving forward and a roll. Words that come to mind - Very smooth and responsive on toe off\n\n**Outsole**\n\nPuma grip is fantastic better than Saucony. Great for cornering and imagine it be good in the wet.\n\n**Ride**\n\nCushioned and Protective similar to saucony pro 3, maybe less harsh. Very smooth transitions - versatile and forgiving. Bouncy and responsive off toe off. Rocker not to aggressive, early and seems quite natural.  The ride I feel is fairly similar to the Saucony pro 3, but faster and seem to be more responsive foam, a quick slight sink and bounce with a more powerful toe off. It seems okay at slower paces too, not clunky.\n\n**~Overall~**\n\n**~Strengths:~** Great lockdown, Enjoyable ride, efficient – propulsive snappy at toe off, versatile for various paces and distances, works for various runners. Reasonably stable. Light, Cushioned – not to firm or soft. Cheaper than a lot of carbon plated shoes.\n\n**Weaknesses:** Runs probably ½ size long, runs narrow (suit my feet), little yellow dye on my white socks after ½ marathon run.  \n\n**~So overall~** - one of the most enjoyable plated shoes, which light, protective and cushioned and reasonably stable. Efficient, bouncy with snappy toe off, quick transitions, easy to pick-up the pace and hold the pace. (Probably repeated myself). It’s a versatile shoe (Trainer/racer) for short and long runs, for training at faster paces. Tempo runs, intervals, and for races. I would use it for 5 km to ½ marathon races and for slower runners like me.\n\nIt’s a good replacement or addition to the Saucony pro 3’s and I feel it’s a little bit more responsive too. I would give them at least 9/10.  Please ask any questions you like.   ",

At slower paces, tight turns are manageable. Two things I observed though: 1) the bounciness firms up if I tie the laces too tight. 2) these are a very, very narrow shoe. At the 20th kilometer mark, I felt my toe nails dying, even with a full thumb's width. I was so happy to crawl into my crocs after the race.",

Maybe instead they could get a new daily area with both Voss and Gormak storylines, reputations and rewards. I think Voss companion and Gormak armor sets and weapons might be cool.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow back to galactic seasons, here are some ideas (i mainly tried to think of companions with species that no current companions have):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Hoth / winter themed season with Ortolan companion, mining drill - like weapons, coldwear type outfits. White/Light Blue dye, Dark Blue / Pale yellow dye.\n* Rishi themed season (Not pirates this time, more like the planet + people) with a Rishi companion, tribal weapon sets and new swimwear armor sets. White / Yellow dye, Medium red /Medium brown dye.\n* Green Jedi themed season with a Mirialan companion (There is not one yet as far as I know). This one could be dressable like Altuur, Hexid ... 2nd tier Weapons would be green colored to fit with some green player outfits. Some nice Jedi outfits. Medium Green / Medium green dye, Green / brown dye (Some special tones)\n* Ancient Sith themed season with a Massassi companion, Ancient sith lord armors and weapons. Pale red / Dark gray dye, Golden and deep red dye.\n* Killik themed season with a Killik companion (with a terminate ability), Killik staff and blades + some cool ranged weapons, some new Alderaanian armors. Pale brown / light brown dye, Light yellow / Deep blue dye. Primary and secondary golden dyes.\n\nWhat do you think about these ideas ? What would you like to see ?",

I'd really love a true neutral, \"Grey Jedi\" companion. Or more specifically a Grey Force-user, not actually aligned with the Jedi or Sith -- a character kind of like Revan, who sees the importance of understanding BOTH sides. \n\nI always thought a general 'Alliance' force-user would be cool; a neutral character who used to be either Sith or Jedi but has since abandoned their former Order for the Alliance. Or an Order of Shasa companion, because the Selkath are really cool. Once I also came up with an idea for a neutral Miraluka companion who was part of the Luka Sene. I'm just so sick of the pure \"Good or Evil\" paradigm with Star Wars in general.",

Maybe a bodytype 3/4 male mandalorian, since there is too many bodytype 2 companions already.",

I don't know how they could do it but that would make me excited. Wipe companions and start adding new companions and have the stories include those few \"deluxe\" companions, make them more detailed and have more personality. Give them more dialogue. This would also allow romances to be updated and more thorough. Romances are so empty right now. Lana is the best done romance right now but as it stands, nothing about it makes a difference in my day to day gaming.\n\nGive me a reason to bring my romance with me on my dailies or explorations. Give them more dialogue, maybe give them a bonus so anytime you play with your romance you both get some type of bonus.\n\nThis game right now is bloated with so much useless stuff. Either that or change the UI so I don't have to go through a list of companions to find the one I want. But I'd rather just an entirely different system for companions because they're just decorations at this point. Almost none of them feel like people anymore. We don't need every story ally to be a companion either.\n\nThe companion system right now needs direction. At this point it just feels like Pokemon, catching every character in the story.",
