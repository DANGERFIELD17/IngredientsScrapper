However, I didn't get along with tamanu oil in the past (this serum contains 10%) so I'd hesitate to purchase this without trying it out first. \n\nOn a superficial level I love the pump bottle + the aesthetics and the fact that it's 40ml. And Krave Beauty will also donate 2% of every sale of the GBR serum to a foundation that protects the Great Barrier Reef here in Australia! Overall I'm really interested to read the reviews for this product :)\n\n*Edit: percentages and COSDNA link*\n\n*Edit 2: here’s the YouTube video introducing the product (https://youtu.be/q_HcZm9OjJ8). It has a few before and after pics towards the end*",

It also seems weird to me that there would be lactic acid in this, as it can be bad for some with sensitive skin (which you’d think this product would want to be totally safe for) and according to the Simple Skincare Science post on repairing your barrier ( https://simpleskincarescience.com/dehydrated-skin-moisture-barrier-acne-fix/ ) would want to avoid all chemical exfoliants for a month at least while you are letting it repair and before you start to add a chemical exfoliants back in. So it’s odd to me that this would have lactic acid in it, instead of just being a super repairing moisturizer that anyone can use no matter what other actives they already use. I am on a Curology script for Tret and I’d be wary of over exfoliating with this as it has the lactic acid in it, but if it didn’t I’d love to be able to use a super moisturizing and barrier strengthening product after my Tret! 🤔",

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

    "body": "Cleansing balms\n\nUPDATE 8/20/20: I’m adding a new balm I’ve recently tried (at the bottom of the list). If anyone has tried balms that you’d like to review in the format used, please post them below!!!\n\nOk, I’ve been (still am) on a mission to try and review all of the best/most popular cleansing balms in an effort to find the very very best one. I’ve tried nearly all of the most popular ones now. I searched everywhere for a comprehensive review of all of these and couldn’t find much so I’m hoping this will be a helpful resource to others who might be looking too. I welcome any input!!\n\nBackstory:\nI had been using The Body Shop’s Camomile balm since way before cleansing balms went mainstream, for probably a decade at least. I never knew there were other options until I was given a sample of Farmacy Green Clean and that’s what started me down this path - I wanted to see what the best option truly is! I liked my Camomile but could there be a better balm out there waiting for me??!\n\nAs always, YMMV but below are my results! All prices are in Canadian dollars and I have not researched pricing or availability in other countries.\n\nAs for what I actually use it for - I don’t wear a full face of makeup every single day but I do always wear a tinted sunscreen and mascara at a minimum, usually with a light powder foundation, blush and brow gel as well. I’ve tried every balm below on little to no makeup up to a full face of special occasion makeup.\n\nA note about ingredients - I’ve copied ingredient lists below from the brands websites. It was important to me to evaluate which ones have polyethylene (plastic) as well as essential oils.\n\nI would LOVE to hear your thoughts on those below or any other options I haven’t tried yet!\n\n**TL;DR FINAL VERDICT**: for a really good clean and soft face, Drunk Elephant’s Slaii is probably the best value in terms of value, packaging, ingredients, etc. I think this will continue to be my go to in the super dry winter months (especially since I tend to wear a bit thicker makeup in the winter), but to be honest, I think I will probably continue use my trusty Body Shop Camomile Cleansing Butter in the summers.\n\n**The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter**\n\nSize: 90mL (3oz).   \nPrice: $17 CAD @ The Body Shop reg price (but it’s often on sale).   \nPrice per oz: $5.67/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a wide and flat metal tin that is perfect for storing bobby pins or things in after (no plastic packaging, yay!). I have had a few times over the years where the threads get misaligned and stuck if it was tightened wrong and have needed to use a knife or screwdriver to pry it open again.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.   \nTexture & Emulsion: When scooping the balm out, it stays a little solid as you rub it into your skin. I wouldn’t say it emulsifies 100% to an oil but it feels great on the face and it’s super spreadable once warmed up. Doesn’t feel greasy/oily, more creamy.    \nScent: Very neutral scent, I don’t believe there are any added scents, essential oils or fragrances.    \nOn the Eyes: It doesn’t sting the eyes at all, but sometimes there’s a light film, if so I just blink a few times and it goes away.    \nAmount Required: A very small amount is required for my whole face (probably about 1/2 tsp max) and one tin easily lasts me a few months.    \nIngredients: No plastic to be found here! I also love that the ingredient list is short and sweet.    \nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Citric Acid.    \n\nVERDICT: I’ve loved this forever and to be honest, now that I’ve tried some others I’m not totally sure if the grass is actually greener on the other side. Still a top contender for me and the price is amazing! I do wonder though if my skin feels a just a tiny bit less moisturized after using this (compared to some of the others below)...\n\n**Farmacy Green Clean** \n\nSize: 90mL (3oz).   \nPrice: $45 CAD @ Sephora Canada.   \nPrice per oz: $15/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes, but the plastic tray it is stored in is very flimsy (sits in top of the tub).    \nTexture & Emulsion: When scooping the balm out, it melts easily and emulsifies quickly to rub around your face. Not greasy/oily.    \nScent: Light citrusy scent (almost like a lime sherbert or something) that smells so good I just want it all over my face all the time.    \nOn the Eyes: I do find it causes quite a bit of a film if I use it on the eyes (something I’d never really experienced before with the Camomile balm), no stinging unless it gets directly in the eyes. Makeup dissolves easily with minimal rubbing or tugging.    \nAmount Required: A small amount is required.    \nIngredients: While they say it’s not “microbeads” and that it melts in water, this product does contain polyethylene aka plastic. Take that for what you will. This product does have quite a bit of essential oils and extracts.    \n\nCetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Peg-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Peg-10 Isostearate, Polyethylene, Phenoxyethanol, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Amino Esters-1, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Amber Powder, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Water/ Aqua/ Eau, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Echinacea Purpurea Root Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Moringa Pterygosperma Seed Extract, Disodium Phosphate, Citric Acid.   \n\n\nVERDICT: I like it, I love it, I want some more of it. It smells amazing and feels luxurious on the face. Even though a little goes a long way, I do have a hard time justifying spending that much money on a first cleanser (and I don’t love that it contains polyethylene and a lot of essential oils).\n\n**Physicians Formula The Perfect Matcha 3-in-1 Melting Cleansing Balm**\n\nSize: 41mL (1.4oz).  \nPrice: $15 CAD @ Shoppers Drug Mart (also find at Walmart, Superstore etc).   \nPrice per oz: $10.71/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a screw top and an internal insert underneath. The insert holds the very tiny spatula.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes but it’s tiny, about the size of a safety pin.   \nTexture & Emulsion: It melts but it’s not overly emollient and isn’t as spreadable as others I’ve tried.    \nScent: Sort of a light essential oily/green tea/citrus scent. Some say it smells like Green Clean but I completely disagree and it’s nowhere near as nice of a smell.    \nOn the Eyes: A bit of eye stinging and a definite film was to be had.    \nAmount Required: Larger amount required to effectively remove makeup/sunscreen of any I’ve tried to date.    \nIngredients: Looks like we have that ever present plastic again (polyethylene) as well as fragrance, food colouring and citrus essential oils. Sad face.    \nCETYL ETHYLHEXANOATE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SORBETH-30 TETRAOLEATE, PEG-5 GLYCERYL TRIISOSTEARATE, PEG-10 ISOSTEARATE, POLYETHYLENE, FRAGRANCE/PARFUM, CAMELLIA SINENSIS LEAF POWDER*, PHYLLOSTACHYS EDULIS SHOOT WATER**, NELUMBO NUCIFERA FLOWER EXTRACT***, CITRUS NOBILIS (MANDARIN ORANGE) PEEL OIL, WATER/EAU, PHENOXYETHANOL, SORBITAN SESQUIOLEATE, POLYGLYCERYL-10 OLEATE, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, LACTIC ACID, SODIUM BENZOATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, MALTODEXTRIN, YELLOW 5 (CI 19140), BLUE 1 (CI 42090). *MATCHA, **BAMBOO, ***LOTUS\n\nVERDICT: It’s a no from me, dawg. I couldn’t wait to finish this (relatively small) tub so I could try the next product. Having heard so many claims that it’s a perfect dupe for Green Clean, I was VERY disappointed. IMO they are nothing alike other than the colour (both balms are a light green colour). Smell, texture, effectiveness, price, ingredients - nothing wowed me.\n\n**Heimish All Clean Balm**\n\nSize: 120mL (4oz).   \nPrice: $23.95 CAD @ Amazon.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $5.99/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a flip top. Under the lid is a second lid which holds the included spatula. I like that the spatula is separated from the product but the extra lid makes it extra bulky in my cabinet.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes.   \nTexture & Emulsion: This balm I’d say emulsified almost immediately to a complete oil. It has a light oil feel (similar to say a sunflower oil, not as thick as an olive oil for example). It melts right away once it touches your face and feels like an oil face massage as you rub it in. It feels quite luxurious!    \nScent: Light floral scent (smells like essential oils). I like it and it’s not too overpowering IMO but I have heard some people find it too strong of a scent.    \nOn the Eyes: No stinging and the eye film is minimal.    \nAmount Required: I’d say a medium amount. Definitely more than the Camomile and Green Clean but it doesn’t seem excessive.    \nIngredients: There is polyethylene (plastic) in this as well as a number of essential oils which those with sensitive skin may wish to avoid.    \nEthylhexyl palmitate, cetyl ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, polyethylene, PEG-8 isostearate, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, cocos nucifera (coconut) fruit extract, citrus aurantifolia (lime) fruit extract, freesia refracta extract, iris versicolor extract, jasminum officinale (jasmine) extract, lilium tigrinum extract, leontopodium alpinum extract, nelumbium speciosum flower extract, narcissus pseudo-narcissus (daffodil) flower extract, rose extract, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) peel oil, lavandula angustifolia (lavender) oil, pelargonium graveolens flower oil, amyris balsamifera bark oil, citrus paradisi (grapefruit) peel oil, eucalyptus globulus leaf oil, melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) leaf oil, juniperus mexicana oil, boswellia carterii oil, citrus aurantium bergamia (bergamot) fruit oil, tocopheryl acetate, 1,2-hexanediol.\n\nVERDICT: There’s a lot to love about this - the scent and the texture are awesome, the price is definitely right, and I enjoy using it. My skin does always feel great after and it doesn’t dry me out. Cons for me are the bulky packaging, the amount of essential oils and the microbeads. I do like it but I’m not ready to stop my search quite yet.\n\n**Drunk Elephant Slaai**\n\nSize: 115mL (3.83oz).   \nPrice: $45 @ Sephora Canada.   \n(Note that this price includes a small vial of Bamboo Booster (physical exfoliating grains) as well).   \nPrice per oz: $11.75/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top. The spatula is magnetic and sits on top of the tub via a magnet (super handy for the makeup cupboard but also exposed/can pop off in a makeup bag while travelling).    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes.    \nTexture & Emulsion: Feels like softened butter and emulsifies to a thick oil feeling (similar to olive oil).     \nScent: Neutral, but a light olive oil type scent. I wish it had a nicer smell but it’s not offensive.     \nOn the Eyes: No stinging, easily removed eye makeup.    \nAmount Required: just a little, I’d say the smallest amount of any I’ve tried which is great news for it lasting a good while.\n\nIngredients: There don’t appear to be any polyethylene in this product and it’s lighter on the essential oils as well (good news if you have sensitive skin).\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Lauryl Laurate, Polyglyceryl-3 Laurate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Wax, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Oil, Actinidia Chinensis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Ananassa (Strawberry) Seed Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Polyglyceryl-2 Caprate, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Seed Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Schinziophyton Rautanenii Kernel Oil, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Ximenia Americana Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Glycerin\n\nVERDICT: Love love love! Definitely don’t use too much but when using a small amount the oiliness isn’t too much and it makes my face feel soft and clean. However, a second cleanse is a must.\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Balm**\n\nSize: 125mL (4.17oz).    \nPrice: $40 @ Sephora Canada.    \nPrice per oz: $9.59/oz.    \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.    \nTexture & Emulsion: Texture is comparable to a solid form coconut oil (similar to the Heimish balm in texture and colour also). Emulsified quickly to a soft oil.    \nScent: Unscented.    \nOn the Eyes: A light film, but no stinging. Takes extra rubbing to loosen stubborn eye makeup.    \nAmount Required: Medium amount (not as much as Heimish but not as little as Drunk Elephant).    \n\nIngredients: Very short ingredients list but unfortunately, those classic plastics are in this balm as well (polyethylene).\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate , Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil , Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride , Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate , Polyethylene , Peg-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate , Water\\Aqua\\Eau , Tocopherol , Phenoxyethanol\n\nVERDICT: Honestly, I have no real bad things to say. It’s utilitarian. It doesn’t feel luxurious but it works.\n\n\n**Acure Seriously Soothing 3 in 1 Serum**\n\nSize: 50mL (1.7 oz).   \nPrice: $23.49 @ well.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $13.82/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a glass jar with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.   \nTexture & Emulsion: A very soft solid serum that gets a little melty when room temperature is quite warm. It melts immediately in your hand/on your face and becomes a liquidy oil. It feels luxurious but does leave an oily film so a second cleanse is definitely required.\nScent: Strong scent due to the blue tansy oil (some might not like it but I do!)\nOn the Eyes: It’s very gentle and doesn’t sting or leave a film.\nAmount Required: Very little required. I’d say about half a teaspoon for my whole face including eye makeup.\nIngredients: No plastic here! Just very basic natural ingredients.\n\nCaprylic/capric Triglyceride, Euphorbia Cerifera(Candelilla) Wax, Copernicia Cerifera(Carnauba) Wax, Butyrospermum Parkii(Shea) Butter, Rosa Canina(Rosehip) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa(Argan) Oil, Tocopherol(Vitamin E), Tanacetum Annum (Blue Tansy)flower Oil, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant)seed Oil.\n\nVERDICT: I didn’t originally buy this for a cleanser, (just as a balm) but used it in a pinch as my first cleanse when I accidentally lost my jar of Slaai on a camping trip. I love how my skin feels soft and soothed after using it as a cleanser and it feels so silky on my skin. It is a little on the expensive side but I think it’s a keeper for sure seeing as it’s so versatile!!\n\n**Banila Co. Clean It Zero Original Balm Cleanser**\n\nSize: 100mL (3.3 oz).   \nPrice: $27.96 @ Amazon.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $8.40/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: TBD.   \nTexture &amp;amp; Emulsion: TBD.   \nScent: TBD.   \nOn the Eyes: TBD.    \nAmount Required: TBD.   \nIngredients: Doesn’t look like there’s any microbeads in this bad boy, thankfully!\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, PEG-10 Isostearate, Synthetic Wax, Onsen-Sui, Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Lithospermum Erythrorhizon Root Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Ethylhexylglycerin, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Bambusa Vulgaris Leaf/Stem Extract Aspalathus Linearis Extract, Angelica Archangelica Root Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Polydiethyleneglycol Adipate/IPDI Copolymer, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Acrylates/Methoxy PEG-15 Methacrylate Copolymer\n\nVERDICT: TBD - haven’t tried it yet but I plan to so I’ve included the info I was able to find so far.\n\n\nYour turn!

I may or may not have been keeping a weather eye on upcoming SPF releases ever since Director Ahn In-Sook mentioned in passing in a video that many cosmeceutical brands have either put a stopper on releasing new sunscreens or postponed the release of those awaiting completion to better the formula and ensure they're up to snuff, thus there will be a slew of SPF releases come March. ~~Heaven forfend we suffer the wrath of deadly solar lasers cuz finding The One is nothing short of a bluidy struggle.~~\n\nWhat I've noted in these new releases was a combination of robust formulas and new filters. *Exciting!* I've already translated the INCI lists and entered them into Incidecoder & Cosdna.

I'm pretty sure these are all  the same base sunscreen with the same protection. I would get the sunscreen with the simplest ingredient list and whichever one is cheapest. The About Me Be Clean seems to be alcohol and fragrance-free (non sure if rosemary leaf oil is an essential oil and fragrant??). I would probably go with the Innifree though because I prefer alcohol in my sunscreen, otherwise they are too too dewy and greasy looking, and the ingredient list is rather simple. If only it didn't have fragrance, but I can compromise with that. The Dr. G has too many unnecessary ingredients and many comedogenic ingredients like myristic acid, so I would stay away from it.",

    "body": "I bought my Creami to try to make low calorie, low fat and low sugar frozen treats so that I didn't feel like I was missing out. Also, because the store bought alternatives are ridiculously expensive. I compiled this ingredient guide for myself but thought that it might be useful to others with similar dietary goals.\n\nI am not vegan, so will mostly be using straight Skim Milk whenever milk is required. Because of this I have not done a deep dive into plant based milks.\n\nCountry I am based in is Australia.\n\nHope this is useful for someone:\n\n**ALLULOSE:**\n\nAllulose is a sugar substitute (technically a “rare sugar”) with a low freezing point, so that it prevents complete freezing of water. As such, it doesn’t get rock-hard like other non-sugar sweeteners can. Allulose has about double the freezing point depression of regular sugar. It contributes to a creamy texture and reduced ice crystals. It may reduce the requirement for re-spinning if you do not consume the whole tub in one sitting. Allulose is 70% as sweet as regular sugar. It contains 0.2 - 0.4 calories per gram (sources vary), compared to regular sugar, which contains 4 calories per gram.\n\nAllulose occurs naturally in small quantities in some foods, including wheat, raisins and figs. It can be made naturally when processing fructose and sucrose, or it can be chemically synthesised.\n\nAllulose mimics the properties of sugar in cooking and baking more than most sugar substitutes e.g. it browns and caramelises when cooked and it lowers the freezing point of water.\n\nUnlike sugar, Allulose does not cause spikes in blood sugar or insulin.\n\nUse 1.33 cups Allulose for every 1 cup of Sugar. 1 cup of Allulose = 160g. 1 cup of White Sugar = 200g.\n\nUse 0.8g Allulose for every 1g of Sugar.\n\nAs a guide, use 2 – 3 Tbs per pint.\n\n\\* Excess consumption may have a laxative effect for some people. There is little long-term data surrounding the consumption of Allulose. Some scientists believe that like other artificial sweeteners, it may be detrimental to heart health.\n\n**AQUAFABA:**\n\nAquafaba can replace eggs and egg whites in ice cream because it has a similar foaming texture, resulting in a light and fluffy texture.\n\nThe proteins, carbohydrates and other soluble plant solids emulsifying, foaming, binding, gelatinising and thickening properties.\n\nAquafaba can be used to replace cream in ice creams, providing a lower fat and calorie content.\n\nAquafaba is vegan and does not have a bean-y taste.\n\n**CAPELLA SUPER SWEET (Liquid Sucralose) :** A highly concentrated form of Sucralose aka “Splenda”\n\nSucralose is made from sugar, but is not recognised as sugar by the body. Sucralose is 600 times sweeter than sugar. It provides a sugar-like taste with no strong aftertaste and is a very stable ingredient in most recipes. Sucralose contains groups of hydroxyls that may provide an emulsifying action. Sucralose is considered to be one of the safest artificial sweeteners and has undergone rigorous testing. Most studies show that Sucralose has little to no effect on blood sugar and insulin levels, however some studies indicate that Sucralose could reduce insulin sensitivity and increase blood sugar and insulin levels. There are conflicting studies around the safety of Sucralose in cooking and baking. One 2010 study found that heating Sucralose with Glycerol (a compound found in fat molecules) produced harmful substances named chloropropanols, which may increase the risk of cancer. For this reason, some people may wish to use alternative sweeteners when baking at temperatures above 175 degrees Celsius.\n\n1 Drop Capella Super Sweet is Equivalent to 1 tsp Sugar\n\n4 Drops Capella Super Sweet are Equivalent to 4 tsp Sugar (20ml capacity, Tablespoon)\n\nAs per Tanya at Capella USA – 2.4ml Super Sweet = 1 US cup (237ml capacity) Sugar… Therefore… ***2.53ml (half a metric teaspoon) Super Sweet = 1 Metric Cup of Sugar***\n\nAs a guide, add 1 drop per 225g to your food or beverage to taste.\n\nCapella Super Sweet is a Zero Calorie sweetener. It has zero freezing point depression qualities and offers no bulking effect to a Creami mix.\n\nWhile Sucralose is calorie-free, “Splenda” contains the carbohydrates dextrose (glucose) and maltodextrin and provides 3.36 calories per gram.\n\n**CHICKPEAS:**\n\nLegumes contain protein, fibre and many micronutrients. Chickpeas can provide bulk, structure and a creamy texture and mouth feel to Creami blends. Chickpeas contain a protein that simulates the taste and texture of dairy better than most other vegan ingredients. The protein also stabilises, prevents crystallisation and reduces graininess and iciness. Chickpeas have quite a neutral taste in ice cream.\n\n**CONDENSED MILK:**\n\nCondensed Milk contributes to the sweetness, texture and flavour of ice cream. The high sugar content lowers the freezing point of the mixture, providing a softer, creamier texture. The higher sugar content also makes it easier to scoop. Condensed Milk also absorbs some of the liquids in the mix, preventing large ice crystals and providing a smoother, silkier texture. The gooey texture of Condensed Milk acts as a binder, holding the ingredients in the mixture together.\n\nCondensed Milk is made by evaporating 60% of the liquids from Regular Milk and adding about double its weight in sugar.\n\n1 Metric Cup (250ml) Condensed Milk weighs 320g. 1 Australian can of Condensed Milk (395g) contains 308ml Condensed Milk.\n\nTo convert recipes using Condensed Milk substitute with a 340g can Carnation Light & Creamy Evaporated Milk (1 can equals 318ml) **PLUS** 357g Sugar (1.8 metric cups) or equivalent sugar substitute e.g. 288g Allulose, 7ml Capella Super Sweet etc.\n\n1 metric cup of Evaporated Milk equals 266g. To convert 1 cup of Evaporated Milk to the same sweetness as Condensed Milk, add 1 ¼ cups Sugar (281g) or equivalent sugar substitute e.g. 266g Allulose **OR** 3.16ml Capella Super Sweet\n\n**CORN SYRUP: (Used in Recipes in the Ninja Creami Manual)**\n\nCorn Syrup behaves similar to invert sugar (a liquid sugar made from table sugar, made up of 50% Glucose and 50% Fructose). It makes ice creams and especially sorbets smoother, richer and less icy. It is more thick or viscous than sugar syrup and 67% less sweet than Sugar by weight. Unlike honey, agave nectar, molasses and maple syrup it has a neutral taste. Corn Syrup adds creaminess and improves texture. Because has less sweetness than sugar, you can use much more of it to improve the texture of the mix without making it too sweet. If Corn Syrup is unavailable, a mild flavoured Honey or Golden Syrup can be substituted. If available. Allulose Syrup can be used as a low calorie Corn Syrup substitute.\n\n**COTTAGE CHEESE:** Cottage Cheese adds is MSNF or Milk Solids Non Fat to Creami blends . It adds more protein, and some salt and water to an ice cream. Cottage Cheese can be used as a thickener and stabiliser in your Creami formulation. It adds a creamy mouth feel to low fat formulations and many people that hate cottage cheese swear that they cannot taste it in their ice cream. Some recommendations include adding approximately 150g of Cottage Cheese per pint (550ml). Regular or low fat Cottage Cheese can be used according to taste and dietary requirements. Cottage Cheese may include various ingredients that act as thickeners, gelling agents, emulsifiers, stabilizers and fat substitutes in Creami recipes, including Carrageenan, Rennet, Vegetable Gums and Firming Agents.\n\n**CREAM:**\n\nCream helps to create a smooth, rich and creamy texture. The fat in cream makes the ice cream firmer and slows melting by stabilising air bubbles. It provides a good taste and mouth feel. Fat does not freeze as hard as water, so the fat makes it easier on the Ninja Creami machine. Cream is a thickener. Most creams in Australia also contain thickening agents.\n\n***Try substituting Carnation Light & Creamy Evaporated Milk for Cream.***\n\n**CREAM CHEESE:**\n\nCream Cheese acts as a stabiliser, a thickener to provide body to the ice cream and a binder to prevent ice crystals. It helps to provide a smooth, creamy texture. Philadelphia brand contains Vegetable Gums (Locust Bean Gum \\[extracted from the seeds of the Carob tree – It Stabilises and Thickens the mixture (increases its Viscosity), and improves the ice cream’s texture, smoothness and mouth feel by binding water. It prevents ice crystals and controls how the ice cream melts. Locust Bean Gum is one of the best gums at reducing ice crystal size, however it requires heating in order to fully hydrate\\] and / or Guar Gum).\n\nUse 1 Tablespoon Cream Cheese per pint (570ml).\n\n***Substitute Cream Cheese with Cottage Cheese or Guar Gum.***\n\n**DATES – SWAPPING WITH SUGAR OR SUBSTITUTING SWEETENER FOR DATES IN A RECIPE TO REDUCE CALORIES:**\n\n* 100g Dried Dates contains 65.9g Sugars and 290 Calories. / 100g Sugar contains 100g Sugars and 382 Calories. ***Try substituting 66g Sugar (or Sugar Replacement for 100g Dates e.g. 86g Allulose / 0.83ml Capella Super Sweet / 17 Drops Capella Super Sweet***\n* 1g Dried Dates contains 0.7g Sugars and 3 Calories. / 1g Sugar contains 1g Sugars and 4 Calories. ***Try substituting 0.66g Sugar (or Sugar Replacement for 1g Dates e.g. 0.88g Allulose / 0.66 Drops Capella Super Sweet***\n* 1 Dried Date (Pitted) weighs approximately 6 grams and contains 4g Sugars and 17 Calories. ***Try substituting 4g Sugar \\[1 teaspoon\\] (or Sugar Replacement for 1 Date e.g. 5g Allulose / 1 Drop Capella Super Sweet***\n\n***To replicate the Caramel flavour provided by the Dates when substituting with artificial sweetener, try adding Roberts Sticky Date Pudding Essence, More Max Flavour Maple Fudge Essence or Caramel Essence.***\n\n* ***You can also try substituting Dates with*** **Queen Sugar Free Maple Syrup*****, which has a similar flavour profile e.g. -***\n   * ***100g Dried Dates = 62g / 62ml Sugar Free Maple Syrup***\n   * ***1g Dried Dates = 0.68g /0.68ml Sugar Free Maple Syrup***\n   * ***1 Dried Date = 3.75g / 3.75ml Sugar Free Maple Syrup***\n\n***\\* 1 cup Sugar Free Maple Syrup weighs approximately 250g, whereas 1 cup Regular Maple Syrup weighs 333g \\****\n\n**EGGS:**\n\nEggs contribute to the flavour, texture and consistency of Ninja Creami ice creams. When heated, the protein in eggs coagulates into a thick gel that traps water, providing a smooth, creamy ice cream.\n\nEggs improve the stability of ice cream, making it slower to melt. When it does melt, the fat and water do not break out of the emulsion, so the ice cream doesn’t become icy when it re-freezes.\n\nEggs prolong the shelf life of ice cream in the freezer.\n\nEggs are typically used in a custard style base.\n\n**EVAPORATED MILK:**\n\nEvaporated Milk contributes to the texture, flavour and body of ice creams. The high protein content provides a fresh-churned texture and limits iciness when stored. It provides a cleaner, milkier flavour than milk powder, which can be chalky. It provides chewiness and body to the ice cream base.\n\nEvaporated Milk is thicker and creamier than regular milk and can be a lower calorie alternative to Heavy Cream.\n\nTo convert recipes using Condensed Milk substitute with a 340g can Carnation Light & Creamy Evaporated Milk (1 can equals 318ml) **PLUS** 357g Sugar (1.8 metric cups) or equivalent sugar substitute e.g. 288g Allulose, 7ml Capella Super Sweet etc.\n\n1 metric cup of Evaporated Milk equals 266g. To convert 1 cup of Evaporated Milk to the same sweetness as Condensed Milk, add 1 ¼ cups Sugar (281g) or equivalent sugar substitute e.g. 266g Allulose **OR** 3.16ml Capella Super Sweet\n\n**GELATINE:**\n\nEmulsifies (mixes two liquids together), Texturises (gives ice cream its texture and prevents large ice crystals from forming, Stabilises (keeps ice cream fresh). Commonly used in other foods and desserts as a thickener or stabilizer e.g. can be used to simulate the mouthfeel of fat in fat-reduced foods.\n\nTo use: Sprinkle gelatine into a small amount of hot water. Whisk until completely mixed. Add the gelatine mix to the remaining liquid. The more water in a recipe, the more gelatine you will need. Do not use more than a teaspoon of gelatine per quart of ice cream (946ml).\n\n**GLYCERIN / VEGETABLE GLYCERIN (Food Grade):**\n\nGlycerine workS extremely well to depress the freezing point of Creami bases in lieu of sucrose (sugar). Glycerine is a humectant. It can be used to make Ninja Creami leftovers scoopable straight out of the bowl. Glycerine tends to make the ice cream mixture expand a bit after blending. It is OK if the container is a little bit past the maximum fill line. The extra bubbles will deflate during freezing. It is fine to leave the mixture to freeze with the lids on because humps do not tend to develop in the Glycerine mixture during freezing.\n\nUse 1.5 teaspoons per Deluxe Pint for high sugar and fat ice cream bases.\n\nUse 2.25 teaspoons for high protein ice cream bases.\n\nUse 3 teaspoons for low fat and low sugar ice cream bases.\n\n**GUAR GUM:**\n\nGuar Gum is a Thickener and Stabiliser. It minimises ice crystals in low fat ice creams and increases Viscosity. It prevents ice crystals from forming and creates a smooth, creamy texture.\n\nUse 0.25 – 0.5 teaspoons Guar Gum per Creami jar.\n\nUse a ratio of 1.5 parts Guar Gum for each 1 part Xanthum Gum when converting recipes containing Xanthum Gum to Guar Gum.\n\n\\*\\* Or buy Aeroplane Lite custard mix (in blue packet), which contains Guar Gum and sprinkle about a heaped teaspoon into your Creami base to create a soft serve texture.\n\nBe careful not to overuse Guar Gum as it has a slight taste and the product can come out gluey if you use too much.\n\n**INULIN (*****I have purchased*** **AGAVE INULIN):**\n\nInulin is a naturally occurring carbohydrate found in some bacteria and fungi, and a variety of plants (e.g. leeks, onions, garlic, asparagus, bananas, Yacon and Chicory). Chicory is the most widely used source of Inulin in the food industry.\n\nInulin is a “Fat Replacer” and “Sugar Replacer”, adding creaminess to an ice cream blend. It minimises ice crystals to give a smooth, creamy texture.\n\nSeveral types of Inulin are available, including Native Inulin, Short-Chain Oligofructose and Long-Chain High Performance Inulin.\n\nNative Inulin contains 6 – 10% Sugars (glucose, fructose and sucrose), and tastes slightly sweet. It is mainly used as a fat replacer in low or reduced fat ice creams. Fat can be reduced by 30% with 5% native inulin.\n\nShort-Chain Oligofructose is produced from Native Inulin. Its sweetness profile is very similar to sugar, and it has about 30 – 50% of the sweetness. Short-Chain Oligofructose is used in ice cream mainly as a low calorie sugar replacement. It can replace up to 30% of the sugar in full-fat ice cream, reduces ice crystals and increases the amount of air that is whipped into the mix, decreasing air-cell size and increasing creaminess. The ice cream produced however, is harder than ice creams using straight sucrose.\n\nInulin is a great, low calorie fat replacer. In milk or water it forms a particle gel network, providing a smooth, creamy texture with a fat-like mouth feel, and can replace up to 100% of the fat in a product. Large amounts of water are bound in the gel network. Long-Chain High Performance Inulin is the best form of inulin for fat replacement. It has double the effectiveness of standard inulin and zero contribution to sweetness. It increases the perception of creaminess, increases resistance to melting and extends the shelf life of the product better than Oligofructose.\n\nBecause the amount of frozen water increases, lowering the fat content of ice cream with inulin does result in a harder ice cream.\n\nAdding Native Inulin, Short-Chain Inulin *and*Oligofructose to a low fat ice cream depresses its freezing point, resulting in less frozen water, and therefore provides a softer texture. Oligofructose depresses the freezing point of the mix more than Native Inulin and Long-Chain Inulin, producing a softer ice cream.\n\nAs the viscosity, or thickness of a liquid increases, so does the perception of creaminess and its resistance to melting. Inulin increases the viscosity of an ice cream blend. This is because Inulin and Oligofructose hydrate and bind water. Long-Chain High Performance Inulin thickens mixes more than Native Inulin and Oligofructose.\n\nInulin and Oligofructose extend the shelf life of ice cream by retaining and binding water, and enhancing the viscosity of the unfrozen mix, decreasing the diffusion of water molecules and retarding the growth of ice crystals. Long-Chain High Performance Inulin extends shelf life better than Oligofructose.\n\nInulin and Oligofructose have several health benefits, including being prebiotics, suitable for diabetics, reducing the risk of diarrhea, constipation, breast cancer, colon cancer, osteoporosis, heart disease and changes to the immune system. They regulate serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels, improve calcium absorption, reduce plasma glucose levels and have anti-inflammatory effects and help prevent tooth decay.\n\nAlthough there are no safety concerns around eating Inulin or Oligofructose, excess consumption may cause flatulence, bowel movements and abdominal discomfort.\n\nAdults can tolerate 20g Inulin per day or 5-10g Oligofructose.\n\nInulin and Oligofructose contain 2 Calories per gram. Fat contains 9.45 Calories per gram and Sugar contains 4 Calories per gram.\n\n***Approximately 22 grams of Agave Inulin can be added to a Deluxe Creami pint to improve texture, melting qualities and increase the sweetness of the mix.***\n\n**JUNKET / RENNET:**\n\nJunket tablets or Rennet partially curdle milk, creating a custard base without eggs or requiring much cooking.\n\n**MILK:**\n\nMilk contributes to the texture and creaminess of the Creami blend.\n\nMilk fat lubricates the palate, reducing the perception of large ice crystals and making the ice cream feel smoother and creamier.\n\nSkim Milk can be used in the Ninja Creami to reduce the fat and calorie content, however the ice cream will taste less creamy and may have an inferior texture. Ingredients such as Guar Gum, Cottage Cheese, Pudding Mix etc will help to mitigate this.\n\n**PEANUT BUTTER POWDER:**\n\nMost brands recommend a ratio of 2 parts Peanut Butter Powder to 1 part Water or other liquid when reconstituting Peanut Butter Powder to Peanut Butter.\n\nTo substitute Powdered Peanut Butter for Regular Peanut Butter in a recipe, PB2 brand recommend using a ratio of 2 parts Peanut Butter Powder for each 1 part of Regular Peanut Butter.\n\nTo substitute / make 1 Metric Cup of Regular Peanut Butter (250ml capacity / 271g weight) using Peanut Butter Powder would require 202 grams of Peanut Butter Powder **plus** 250ml Water or preferred liquid.\n\nTo substitute / make 1 teaspoon of Regular Peanut Butter (5ml capacity / 5.4g weight) using Peanut Butter Powder would require 4 grams of Peanut Butter Powder **plus** 5ml Water or preferred liquid.\n\n**PROTEIN POWDER:**\n\nIn addition to being a high source of protein nutritionally, Protein Powder helps to create structure and can make the ice cream thicker and creamier. Structure is created through whipping, emulsification and water holding capacity. Many Protein Powders contain fat, which increases the creaminess of the mix. Flavoured Protein Powders can add thickness and flavour to the Creami mix. Many Protein Powders contain stabilisers, which improve the texture of the ice cream.\n\n**PUDDING MIX:**\n\nUse 2 Tbs / 8g per pint if not using gums or other thickeners.\n\nAccording to [aqua-calc.com](http://aqua-calc.com), 1 metric teaspoon Dry Pudding Mix weighs an average of 1.06 grams (for both regular and low calorie pudding mixes)\n\n* **Aeroplane Lite Creamy Mousse Mix** (available from Coles and Woolworths), contains –\n   * Polydextrose (a Modified Starch) used as a low-calorie bulking agent that can replace all or part of the sugars and some of the fats in foods while maintaining a pleasant texture and mouthfeel. Polydextrose can also be used as a humectant, texturiser, thickener, stabilizer, and cryoprotectant (reduces the amount of ice that will form at a given temperature).\n   * Gelatine (see above)\n   * Thickener 1442 (Hydroxypropyl-di-starch phosphate) – Stabilizer (ensures the physical properties of products are maintained and that a mixture remains in a uniform state), Emulsifier (forms an emulsion by allowing the mixing of two immiscible (i.e. unmixable) liquids such as water and oil), Thickener (gives the liquid more texture by increasing its viscosity). Forms gels without the need for heating. Has good freeze – thaw properties – after thawing and freezing foods do not lose their flavour and have a more uniform texture and colour. A type of Modified Starch.\n   * Milk Solids (e.g. Skim Milk Powder) assists with\n      * Water Balance (absorbs water, reducing the amount of \"free water\" in the mixture, preventing ice crystals from forming.\n      * Structure: (provides structure and body)\n      * Emulsification: (acts as an emulsifier, binding to both the fat and liquid in the base)\n      * Flavor: (contributes to the dairy flavour of ice cream)\n      * Stabilization: (helps to stabilize the final product by trapping air bubbles in the fat globules)\n      * Contributes to richness, creaminess, and melting characteristics\n* **Aeroplane Lite Custard** (available at Coles and Woolworths), contains –\n   * Thickener 1422 (Acetylated di-starch adipate) - a food additive of the thickening agent type, more specifically a bulking agent. Gels and improves texture. It is also used as a stabilizer. A type of Modified Starch.\n   * Thickener 1442 (Hydroxypropyl-di-starch phosphate) – See above.\n   * Guar Gum – See above\n\nSome recipes specifically use the Aeroplane Lite Custard as an ingredient. If not using Guar Gum, Xanthum Gum or Cottage Cheese, 1 heaped teaspoon of Aeroplane Lite Custard can be added per batch to thicken, creamify and stabilise.\n\n* **Cottee’s Instant Vanilla Pudding** (available at Coles and Woolworths), contains –\n   * Maize Thickener \\[1422\\] (Acetylated di-starch adipate) - a food additive of the thickening agent type, more specifically a bulking agent. Gels and improves texture. It is also used as a stabilizer. A type of Modified Starch.\n* **Simply Delish Pudding Mix** (available from Health Food Shop in Burnie, also available online), ingredients vary by flavour, but can include –\n* Starch: Corn starch / Maize Starch, Potato Starch (\\*Ingredient panels do not state that these are Modified Starches, but the fact that the puddings are mixed with cold milk indicates that they probably are).\n* Emulsifier: Sunflower lecithin - combines incompatible liquids into a suspension and prevents them from mixing with other substances.\n* Dextrin - a carbohydrate derived from starch that has many uses, including: used as a thickener, preservative, crisping agent, and anti-caking agent in many foods, such as soups, sauces, sweets, and baby food. Dextrin is more soluble in cold water than most starches, making it easier to use in food. Dextrins are carbohydrates made from starch naturally present in vegetables and grains. As do many other starch-based ingredients, dextrins have useful thickening properties, which means they help bind ingredients together in food and prevent them from dispersing.\n* **Jell-O Sugar Free Pudding Mix** (available online), ingredients vary by flavour, but typically include –\n* Modified Cornstarch - Thickens, Binds (Holds ingredients together to create a cohesive product with the right structure, texture, and mouthfeel. Can also help with moisture retention, flavour encapsulation, and gelation), Emulsifies (Combines incompatible liquids into a suspension and prevents them from mixing with other substances) and Stabilizes (Reduces ice crystal growth, Reduces air bubble size, Slows down melting, Increases smoothness, body and creaminess, Delivers flavour cleanly). Can reduce the growth of ice crystals during freezing. Locks water into place, creating a smoother, more satisfying ice cream. Often used in non-custard ice cream. Will thicken in cold liquid. Regular corn starch and most other starches (tapioca, potato, arrowroot, etc) require heat to gelatinize. Modified starches serve as “fat mi­metics”—creating “a fat-like mouthfeel”. As fat replacers, they act “directly as fat globules.”\n* Corn Maltodextrin – Another Modified Cornstarch that provides smooth, creamy texture, provides body and mouthfeel, contributes bulking or solids, produces a firmer ice cream that melts slowly during consumption and extends shelf-life during storage. Gels (turns a liquid into a gel-like state, creating a texture that is a combination of solid and liquid), binds and prevents crystallization. Assists with control of freezing, and fat replacement.\n* Maltodextrin - A non-sweet, nutritive saccharide polymer (Modified Starch) that is used as a thickener, filler, preservative, emulsifier, stabilizer and source of carbohydrates in many foods. Derived from starches like corn, potato, wheat, and rice. Used in puddings to increase volume and thicken texture. Can also be combined with artificial sweeteners to sweeten desserts. Used as a Fat Replacer in dairy products, confectionary, frozen desserts, cereal, baked goods, and meat products due to its ability to form soft, spreadable, thermoreversible gels (forms a gel when cooled and returns to a viscous fluid state when exposed to heat) with melt-in-the-mouth properties. Imparts a full-bodied texture and mouth coating. Often used as a bulking agent or a sweetener in various food products, providing a source of carbohydrates without the intense sweetness of table sugar. Can improve texture and consistency.\n* Sodium Phosphate – Used to Thicken, Stabilize and Emulsify.\n* Tetrasodium Pyrophosphate – Inorganic Salt. Emulsifier, Thickening Agent, improves Stability and Gel Strength.\n* Disodium Phosphate – A water soluble Artificial Salt. A Thickener, Emulsifier (helps to bind fats and water together, which is important for the texture and consistency of dairy products), Stabilizer and pH buffering agent A Preservative, helping to extend the shelf life of foods. An Anti-caking agent, added to powdered products to prevent caking.\n* Calcium Sulfate – A Firming Agent and Coagulant (changes proteins from a liquid to solid state – Thickens, Binds and Stabilizes. Creates a custard texture and mouth-feel.\n* Xanthan Gum (see above)\n* Monoglycerides - Produced by partially hydrolysing vegetable fats like soybean and palm oil. Commonly used as emulsifiers, stabilizers, thickeners, and flavouring agents. Monoglycerides are amphiphilic, meaning they have both hydrophilic (water-attracting) and lipophilic (oil-attracting) components. This allows them to reduce surface tension between water and oil, preventing separation and improving emulsion stability. They improve consistency and texture, helping to stabilise air bubbles and keep them small i.e. prevent foaming.\n* Diglycerides - A type of emulsifier produced from vegetable or animal fats and glycerol through partial hydrolysis. Used in ice cream to improve texture and consistency. Effective at stabilizing air bubbles, keeping them small i.e. prevent foaming. They help oil and water to blend, providing a creamier consistency.\n* Tetrapotassium Pyrophosphate - An Emulsifier, Stabilizer and Thickening Agent that helps to give ice cream a smooth, even texture. It promotes binding proteins to water. Used to improve expansion of ice cream and maintain fat dispersion.\n* Dipotassium Phosphate - A synthetic salt made by combining phosphate, phosphorus, and sodium, resulting in a white, powdery substance that easily dissolves in liquid. Used as an emulsifier, stabilizer, buffering agent (acidity regulator) and texturiser. A Chelating Agent (prevents lipid oxidization), especially for the calcium in milk products.\n* Bha (Butylated hydroxyanisole) - A synthetic, , waxy, solid petrochemical antioxidant. Used in many foods as a preservative to prevent fats and oils from going rancid.\n\n**SUGAR:**\n\nSugar provides sweetness and helps to release flavours from the other ingredients.\n\nSugar improves the Creami’s texture, providing body and structure, making it scoopable and soft.\n\nSugar reduces the freezing point of ice cream, reducing the amount of ice that forms. This also makes it easier for the Creami blade to process the ice cream mixture.\n\nSugar prevents the formation of ice crystals.\n\nAllulose is the best low calorie sugar substitute for use in the Creami because for the most part, it possesses the same qualities as sugar and behaves just like sugar. It also has a lower freezing point than sugar. Allulose is not as sweet as sugar.\n\nUse 1.33 cups for every cup of Sugar. 1 cup of Allulose = 160g. As a guide, use 2 – 3 Tbs per pint.\n\n**SWEET POTATO / PUMPKIN / STARCHY VEGETABLES:**\n\nPumpkin and Sweet Potato can provide flavour and sweetness to ice cream, as well as a rich, smooth texture.\n\nSweet potatoes can increase the firmness, consistency and hardness of an ice cream, while also increasing its dry matter content (the material remaining after water is removed). The addition of Sweet Potato can increase the first melt temperature and complete melting temperature of an ice cream.\n\nPumpkin’s high water content and low fat can make it difficult to achieve a creamy ice cream texture.\n\n**TOFU**\n\nSoft or Silken Tofu can be used as a replacement for heavy cream to create a fluffy, creamy texture. Tofu is a vegan source of protein. It creates an ice cream which is lower in fat than cream-based ones.\n\n**XANTHUM GUM:**\n\nXanthan Gum is created when glucose is fermented with a bacterium known as Xanthomonas campestris, which is found in cabbage. Its neutral flavour mixes well with nearly any cuisine without changing its original taste. It helps to add a smoother texture to liquid-based treats such as ice cream. Xanthan gum creates ice cream with a perfect, full-bodied mouthfeel, which churns beautifully, melts uniformly and keeps well in the freezer. Xanthan gum's high water-binding capacity helps limit the diffusion of water from and to ice crystals, which can make sorbet less hard and decrease the size of ice crystals. This is one of the best stabilizers to reduce ice crystal size and protect against the heat-thaw cycle. Xanthan gum is unique in its ability to hydrate and disperse at any temperature. Because it does this so quickly, it is one of the few ingredients that you can instantly see results from. As a thickener, blend it into the liquid that you would like to thicken, stir it around, and it will thicken instantly. While xanthan gum powder will work with liquid of any temperature, it may have trouble hydrating if the liquid is overly sugary. This is something to make note of when creating sweets high in processed sugars. Xanthan gum in large amounts will negatively impact the texture of goods, making them slimy, and may cause digestive upset. Xanthan gum can be dispersed into hot or cold liquids, and many grades of gum are available. The powder has a strong tendency to form lumps when added to water and a number of dispersion and hydration methods are used to try and overcome this. *For this reason, many users prefer to use Guar Gum for their Ninja Creami recipes.* Use ⅛ - half a teaspoon of Xanthan Gum per recipe.\n\n**YOGHURT:**\n\nFrozen yoghurt processed in the Creami results in a creamy texture, even when using fat-free yoghurt. Yoghurt, especially Greek Ypoghurt is high in protein and most yoghurts contain beneficial pre and / or probiotic gut bacteria. Many shop-bought frozen yoghurts are high in sugar. Making frozen yoghurt in the Ninja Creami allows you to control the amount of sugar in the blend by selecting which yoghurt is used as a base.\n\nIce cream tends to be fluffier, while frozen yogurt is tangier. The healthiest frozen yogurt will contain live and active cultures, which are beneficial to your gut.\n\nCommercial ice creams and frozen yoghurts are both made with dairy and sugar, although ice cream is made with cream, and frozen yogurt uses cultured milk.",

    "body": "Hi all!  \n\n\nI am back with another skin conditions post. This one is on perioral dermatitis.   \n\n\nAdmittedly, when I began researching this, I knew zilch about PD except that it was acne-like breakouts around the mouth,  and as I began to research it, it seems that there isn't a whole lot that is known about it. Fortunately, it is a highly treatable condition that seems to overlap to a degree with rosacea (earning it the earlier name  of \"steroid rosacea\") and even seborrheic dermatitis.  \n\n\n**As always, please feel free to correct or inform me of anything wrong, and also feel free to post/discuss what helps your PD.**\n\n# What is Perioral Dermatitis\n\nPerioral dermatitis (PD) is a chronic, recurrant inflammatory disease that most commonly occurs in the perioral region of the face (the area around the mouth). It can also affect the area around the nose, and in roughly 20&#37; of cases, it can manifest around the eyes (though it goes by another name if around the eyes: peri-orificial dermatitis).   \n\n\nIt afflicts around 1&#37; of the population of the United States, particularly those with fair skin, and predominately occurs in women between 18-45, with 20s and 30s having peak incidence.   \n\n\nIt presents as small, red, tender, sometimes itchy bumps that can flake and burn. While commonly mistaken for acne, it is distinct from acne in that it only presents in specific locations, spares the small area around the lips, and lacks pustules (whiteheads).\n\n# Causes of Perioral Dermatitis\n\nThe causes of perioral dermatitis are unclear. It is a relatively \"young\" disease that was only first described as a distinct condition in 1964. It is first and foremost an inflammatory condition, and is aggravated by ingredients and habits that can create inflammation either in the skin or in the body. \n\nWhile I was researching PD, the one constant that showed up again and again is that it is aggravated by corticosteroid use -- both topical and inhaled. To specify, that means not just creams like kenalog, triamcinolone, and over-the-counter hydrocortisone, but also asthma inhalers (including Advair, Flovent, and ProAir aka Albuterol) and nasal allergy mists like Beconase, Flonase, Nasonex, Omnaris, and Veramyst. \n\nLess commonly, but still a factor to consider are hormones, where monthly shifts can put the condition into overdrive. More frustrating is that oral contraceptives can worsen PD in some. \n\nOther causes can be fluoridated toothpaste, high SPF value sunscreens¹, sunscreens with the filters zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, the ingredient \"isopropyl myristate,\" improperly removing makeup or sleeping in makeup, occlusive ointments (Vaseline, Aquaphor, and oils, for example), heavy creams with occlusive ingredients, and cold creams (wipe-off cleansing creams that leave a residue, like Pond's). In one case, a woman's favorite lip balm (containing the ingredient propyl gallate) caused her PD.⁶\n\n# Treatment\n\nPD can look like many other conditions, such as acne, angular cheilitis, rosacea, or seborrheic dermatitis, and requires treatment of a professional due to the inflammatory nature of the condition. \n\nThe most important thing for anyone suffering from PD is to discontinue steroid use - whether cold-turkey or weened off with the management of a healthcare professional. While topical steroids can seem to improve the condition, they frequently create a rebound effect, which can make the condition worse. \n\nOnce steroids are removed, the skin will get worse before getting better. This is the toughest part of PD for most people. Topical antibiotics or topical immunosuppresants (such as Pimecrolimus or Elidel) are frequently prescribed due to their tremendously  helpful anti-inflammatory effects on PD, and azelaic acid can prove useful in some cases. In very severe cases, oral antibiotics can be prescribed in addition to topicals. \n\nWhile healing from PD, the skin should not be cleansed with any cleanser, and makeup and skincare products should be avoided completely until the condition resolves. And no matter how tempting, PD should never be scrubbed, as this worsens the inflammation. \n\nOnce treated, it is encouraged to use liquid or gel sunscreens as well as soap-free cleansers that do not dry out the skin, as TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss) is significant in people who suffer from PD.\n\n# Long-Term Care\n\nSome people have PD once in their lives, while others may combat it on and off for several years. If you fall into the latter, it is important to try to avoid triggers that can cause the condition to reoccur (particularly steroid use). That means cleansing your skin each day with gentle cleansers, always removing makeup (removing it with a wipe does *NOT* count - you need to cleanse it away thoroughly with an oil cleanser that rinses cleanly), and using light products, particularly around the areas typically affected. \n\nPrescriptions like azelaic acid and over-the-counter .1&#37; adapalene (Differin)² may  also help to manage the condition in the long-term. \n\nI've put together a list below of some cleansers and moisturizers that are recommended for people suffering from PD. Again, like with my rosacea list, this is not a be-all-end-all list. None of the products listed contain isopropyl myristate or heavy occlusive ingredients.\n\n## Recommended Products\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser** \n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Stearyl Alcohol and Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate​,​ Polysorbate 60​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Panthenol​,​ T-Butyl Alcohol,​ Tocopherol​.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Wate/Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryl Glycol/Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**Avene Extremely Gentle Cleanser Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (avene Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Serine, Cetrimonium Bromide, Coco-Glucoside, Dipotassium Phosphate, Disodium Edta, Disodium Phosphate, O-Phenylphenol, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Water (Aqua).*\n\n**Spectro Jel Cleanser for Blemish-Prone Skin - Fragrance Free**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Hydroxypropyl Methocellulose, Polysorbate 20, Cetyl Alcohol (moisturizer), Hydrated Silica, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Diazolidinyl Urea, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Sorbitan Oleate.*\n\n## Foaming Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Terastearate, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric, Glycerides, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Sodium Chloride, Phytosphingosine, Citric Acid, Edetate Disodium, Dihydrate, Sodium, Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Olay Foaming Face Wash Sensitive**\n\n>*Ingredients: Water/Eau, Glycerin, Sodium Myristoyl Sarcosinate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Polyquaternium-10, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Laureth-10, Disodium Lauroamphodiacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, DMDM Hydantoin.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate​,​ PEG-120 Methyl Glucoside Dioleate,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Hydroxide​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Capryloyl Glycine​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Citric Acid​,​ Acrylates Copolymer​.*\n\n## Makeup Removers\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm**\n\n>*Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Polyethylene, PEG-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Water / Aqua / Eau, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol.*\n\n**Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Mineral Oil, PEG-8 Glyceryl Isostearate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclomethicone, Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Isostearic Acid, Glycerin, Phenoexyethanol.*\n\n## Moisturizers\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Ceteareth-20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Phosphate, Potassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben.*\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3-Diisosterate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide 1, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium phosphate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 20, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Active - Dimethicone, 1\\%.

        "body": "I’ve been diagnosed with Peri-orbital Dermatitis by my dermatologist. I’ve had it for at least 10 years. Peri-orbital means it presents around my eyes, nose and mouth. My worst flare ups cover all three areas, my most frequent flare ups present just around my nostrils. \n\nYes, you’re correct that causes are basically unknown. Successful treatments can vary wildly. \n\n(personally, I’m convinced it has a fungal element, specially related to candida imbalance. That’s just my opinion. I have used OTC topicalS and been prescribed anti-fungal topicals and pills, none of that worked. I believe it is related to gut microbiome health. Our skin is a direct reflection of what’s going on intrinsically in our bodies) \n\nI want chime in here about Zinc Oxide. You mention it as a possible cause. I want others out here to know that high concentration Zinc Oxide Cream is the ONLY thing that stops my flare ups. So if you have PD, I recommend patch testing a high ZO cream on one or two of the papules and see if it helps you. Incidentally, I’ve found recently that micronized ZO particles actually work faster for my than larger particles. So I stopped using Desitin Max strength and started using Neutrogena Sheer Zinc for face with 22% ZO. It stops my flare ups completely in a matter of a day or so, versus 4+ days with the Desitin. \n\nI’ll list below everything I’ve tried in case it’s helpful. The other product I find helpful is daily probiotic pills containing Lactobacillus Acidophilus. I get less flare ups when I take daily probiotics. \n\nDIDN’T WORK: \nAntibacterial Rx creams, I believe I had both Erythromycin and Dapsone. OTC antifungal creams, clotrimazole, miconazole and terbinafine. I also had an oral Rx for Lamisil, it was generic and I can’t recall the generic name. OTC topical steroids, hydrocortisone. Violet extract. Cutting out SLS from from my toothpaste and hair products. (I never cleansed with SLS, always either soap or oil) Changing my diet to an acne safe diet. Getting sun. Staying out of sun. Sulphur washes. Leaving it alone.",

I had no idea what perioral dermatitis was and assumed all this redness was broken capillaries from a Clarisonic. \n\nIt wasn’t until I went to a dermatologist and asked her about it that she said it looked like perioral dermatitis. I was prescribed Finacea and in one month the results have been astounding. Redness has significantly reduced and no closed comedones or inflamed pimples anywhere. Again mine wasn’t severe but for anyone who has it I think azelaic acid is a great choice. \n\nI should point out I never use steroids, I’m 30F and I think this was due to over moisturizing after over exfoliating. I also think the occlusive nature of aquaphor made it much worse. My routine now consists of nothing but cleanser, moisturizer and Finacea. Drastic change from what I was doing before. \n\nThank you for taking the time to post this very informative breakdown of perioral dermatitis.",

I would apply a thick layer in the PM and my skin would have totally absorbed it by morning. My PD was GONE in 3 days. I really feel for those of you struggling with this...it is such a frustrating condition! Now if I detect even the slightest irritation in that area (or anywhere on my face really) I just slather on the Avene CRSC and it disappears overnight.",

This was my first sunscreen I bought after leaning about photoaging! My first baby! And we were off to a good start. It’s a white watery gel-like texture, light weight, invisible, but quite shiny (some might call this a dewy finish, but I prefer a skin-like finish). A good poster child for the typical Asian sunscreen, I guess. It is not water resistant, and you'll notice this as you sweat throughout the day: It’s like your sweat becomes heavier since it mixes with the sunscreen (you can’t see this of course, but it sure feels like it). I was also worried about touching my face throughout the day, because I felt I might rub the sunscreen off. I can’t remember it ever stinging my eyes, but I’m not entirely sure. The biggest drawback for me was the prize and how inaccessible it is in my country. At this point in time, I also hadn’t learnt about the proper amount of sunscreen you have to use, so I was probably underapplying, and the sunscreen can therefore have appeared lighter-textured in my memory. It contains a lot of fragrance and many ingredients, in general, so that could be irritating. A little bit of science: If you look at the UV filters, there are several UVB filters; many UVB (290-320 wavelength/nm) filters also “bleed into” and filter some UVA II (320-340) as well. The Uvinul A plus filters both UVA II and I (340-400), but it’s also the only UVA filter in this sunscreen, and it’s also the last ranking UV filter on the ingredient list, even though I’ve read that the upper limit for Uvinul A plus is 10% (of the total product). So, is there enough UVA protection? I don’t know, but it’s probably okay since the Pa is four pluses, so I wouldn’t worry too much about it. Packaging is nice and it has a pump, and you get 75 ml, not only the standard 50 ml.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Avène Hydrance OPTIMALE UV RICHE Rich hydrating cream**\n\n* \\- **SPF 20, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **40 ml/1.35 Fl.OZ**\n* \\- **Probably suitable for darker skin tones**\n* \\- **France**\n* \\- **Ingredients:** AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA).

It does not have high enough UV protection, and it is not designed to be used as a sunscreen, and therefore you will end up underapplying. I bought it because I was looking for a day cream at the time. I wanted something for my dry skin and this day cream worked in that regard. But never did I ever apply close to the amount of sunscreen you have to apply to get the labelled SPF and UVA protection. It is on the heavier side, so applying a quarter teaspoon to your face would not feel nice. Trust me. And even then, you’d only get SPF 20. I would not recommend anyone to use this product as a daily SPF product. It also contains fragrance even though it says it’s suitable for sensitive skin.\n* \\- **Score:** 2/5\n\n**NIVEA SUN UV FACE ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS SPF 30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

I must have gone though three of these. It has a lot in common with the MAKE P:REM one, and it also shares some of the same problems. It has a similar texture: white watery-gel, which turns translucent on top of the skin. It’s like a glycerine-rich moisturiser. I think it’s less shiny as well – more skin-like finish. The problem arises when you sweat: your sweat starts feeling even heavier than normal. I think I experienced some eye stinging with this sunscreen (nothing major), largely caused by it not being water resistant. It’s important to note that the reason it is so cosmetically elegant is also why it’s not water resistant. I was also scared to touch my face and accidently rub it off while wearing this one, too. It’s smells like sunscreen. If you’ve ever purchased a NIVEA sunscreen, you’ll know what I mean. And the fragrance doesn’t go away immediately either. My biggest problem at the time, was also that I wanted to find a SPF 50 sunscreen, and this one is only SPF 30. I think I’ve recently seen a SPF 50 version of this since, so if you live in Europe, I guess it’s worth giving it a shot. Looking at the ingredient list now, I see that it contains a lot of avobenzone. Avobenzone has a bad rep, but you cannot deny how effectively it protects against UVA when photostable. Avobenzone on its own is not photostable and will start degrading (and be used up) when exposed to the sun or UV light. In this sunscreen, however, (and most non-American sunscreens) it has been stabilised by another UV filter: In this case by Tinosorb S. I think this sunscreen might have much higher UVA protection than the EU requirement, which makes sense since it’s advertised as “ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS”.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Piz Buin Ultra Light Dry Touch Face Fluid SPF 30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Sweat and water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

This sunscreen survived me walking all around Madrid for a week in the middle of summer. Boom. What a trooper. The texture is a thick liquid, not a cream, so the opening is narrow so you can pour some into your hand or tilt your head backwards and pour it directly on your face. It dries to an almost powdery finish – it truly is dry touch. If you have dry skin, you should probably moisturise beforehand. It was also easy enough to reapply when I was out and about in Madrid; So, layering it wasn’t a chore. If you don’t apply it evenly it might dry down with some flakes even – that’s how dry it is. But I didn’t feel like it dried out my skin in the process, but that is of course a very personal observation. I would have been perfect if it was SPF 50, a little less expensive, and fragrance free. If you’ve ever tried a Piz Buin sunscreen, you’ll recognise their trademark fragrance at once: masculine and sunscreen-like. It does bring back good memories of summer and beaches for me personally, though.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**THE BODY SHOP Vitamin E Day Lotion SPF30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

And it’s not water-resistant, so it will on glide on your face as you sweat. But the absolute worst thing about this is how much it stings your eyes. I could barely open them in broad daylight, and I had to go back home and wash my face to get it off. Do not, under any circumstances apply this close to your eyes. I don’t know what caused it: maybe all the perfume, or the UV filters? Also, the way this product smells, is absolutely abhorrent. Old lady perfume, and it’s so strong.

I have very pale skin (and am therefore really scared of “universal tints”), but it blended perfectly into my skin tone, perhaps with the slightest bit of coverage. Since it’s a mineral sunscreen, I’m sceptical if it’ll blend into darker skin, even with the tint, so that’s something to keep in mind. It might also have photo flashback, you have been warned. Even though it is silicone based, I wouldn’t describe it as “silicone-y”, if you know what I mean; it has a skin like finish. However, I don’t think I ever applied enough of it to truly know what its finish is like… First and foremost: the packaging. When I bought it, they still used a dropper – I repeat a dropper. This did not work, as the product would spill over, clump up at the inner edges of the bottle’s mouth, etc. And since it clumped up at the sides, I honestly don’t know if I’ve lost some of the UV protection of the product, since it’s no longer a completely homogenous liquid. They later changed the dropper to a pump, but it’s still embarrassing that they ever sold it with a dropper. What were they thinking? You also spend quite a bit of time applying it evenly on your skin, due to its consistency and tint. You kind of have to apply it like a foundation. Since it’s only 30 ml, it means that you should be finishing one of these in less than a month – and only if you’re just applying it to your face. At least it doesn’t have any fragrance! It does have an iffy smell to it, which goes away. Taking into consideration the cost, the packaging (even though it has improved) the fact that it’s not a SPF 50, PA++++ product, you’re left with a very mediocre sunscreen. It could however serve as a daily serum on top of your sunscreen, if you’re very extra.\n* \\- **Score:** 3/5\n\n**Altruist Dermatologist Sunscreen SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I had really high expectations for Altruist, same as many others, and I was let down. It isn’t that bad of a sunscreen, but it’s also not that good. At this point in my quest for the Holy grail sunscreen, I realised I had to up my UV game. SPF 30 wasn’t enough, and I wanted as high of an UVA protection as possible. With the EU’s regulation of UVA protection (in a nutshell the UVA protection has to be 1/3 of the SPF), you could, in theory, end up with SPF 30 sunscreens that had higher UVA protection than your SPF 50 sunscreen. And as a consumer, you simply wouldn’t know the difference. Anyway, Altruist SPF 50, has perfect UV protection, and no fragrance and such. In theory it’s the perfect sunscreen. I mean, look at all those filters (seriously why are there so many, did the chemists make a bet or something?) But in practice? Not so much. First and foremost, if you have darker skin, this might leave a white cast due to the titanium dioxide. Some people have mentioned this in their reviews and some people have also mentioned it stinging their eyes (I can’t remember noticing this). Secondly, the reason I didn’t like it, is because of the texture. It’s the same sort of texture as the MAKE P:REM and NIVEA mentioned above, just less cosmetically elegant. I thought it would dry down or sink into my face, but it never did. I would wait for 20 minutes, and I would still be sticky and a little bit shiny. What worked was putting a lot of translucent powder on top, then I would finally achieve a more skin like finish. Pro tip: Translucent powder can actually make most sunscreens bearable. Since it didn’t dry down, I felt as I would rub it off if my face touched anything. Maybe this sunscreen would work for people with dry skin? Since applying this sunscreen, waiting, applying powder, would take such a long time, I ended up just using a different sunscreen. And I guess that says it all. It also has a “chemical” smell to it, but that didn’t bother me. It might not have worked for my face, but it’s still a good sunscreen for the rest of the body.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Skinnies Sungel SPF30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, broad spectrum, PA++++ (PPD 16+)**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

This sunscreen utilises a new technology called Organogel™. It contains no water, and thus it doesn’t have to dry down, and you only need 1/5 the amount of a normal sunscreen. You heard that right: 1/5! So, you only need a pea-sized amount for your entire face! But I used a little bit more than that, because real peas are actually very small, so when people say pea-sized, they usually mean 2-3 real peas. A photo from their website illustrating what they meant by pea-sized confirmed my suspicion. But it’s still a very small amount! The texture is that of a see-through slightly orange-y gel. It’s oily, but it doesn’t move on your skin (also when you sweat). And it’s completely see-though so I can with confidence say it’ll suit every skin tone. It doesn’t completely dry down, though, but it does seem to sink into your skin a little bit, if you wait a couple of minutes. You can feel the gel on your skin when you touch it, but you wouldn’t notice you had anything on otherwise. Since it isn’t water based it also feels sturdier than the others I’ve tried, so I wasn’t as scared of it rubbing off when touching my skin. I think it might work very well as a primer. It has a slight “chemical” smell, it also doesn’t contain any perfume or any nonsense like that. It’s on the pricier side, but one 100ml bottle is actually the equivalent of 500ml of normal sunscreen, when you think about it, so I think the prize is justifiable. This was the sunscreen I kept on using when the Altruist one wasn’t working for me, by the way. It’s definitely the quickest sunscreen to apply of all the sunscreens I’ve ever used. A con is that is a little bit difficult to gauge if you are using enough, and that you’ve applied it evenly. Turns out there are two versions of this sunscreen: An American one and a New Zealand one. I somehow ended up with the American one, and it has worked just fine for me. The NZ version uses non-FDA approved filters, but it still has the same UVB and UVA protection listed, but I would still recommend you buy the NZ version, since there must be a reason why they chose to not just use the same formulation as the American one, right? Since I bought my bottle, they have also released many new products, like an SPF 50+. If the SPF 50+ behaves the same way as this one, I think I might have given it a score of 5/5. But keep in mind that it does not have a dry-touch finish (more of an immovable oily finish), but at least it has a sturdy one.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**The Balm BALMSHELTER TINTED MOISTURIZER (Shade: Lighter Than Light)**\n\n* \\- **SPF 18, broad spectrum**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **64 ml/ 2.15 Fl.

Note that this tinted moisturiser is much lighter than any of The Balm’s other products labelled “Lighter Than Light”. It’s really is a pale shade (it appears darker before you spread it over your skin), and it blends perfectly into my skin: I’ve never seen a tinted moisturiser or BB cream this fair before. However, it is so sheer, that the tint almost doesn’t matter. A little goes a long way, and that’s why you shouldn’t really use BB creams, tinted moisturisers and foundation as UV shields. I intended on using this on top of my sunscreen, but since it has next to none coverage, I never find myself reaching for it. If you’re pale as I am, and you want to experience the novelty of owning a tinted moisturiser, this is a good pick. No fragrance, and I haven’t used it close to my eyes.\n* \\- **Score: 2/5**\n\n**La Roche-Posay ANTHELIOS SHAKA ULTRA-LIGHT SPF 50+**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50+, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), PPD 42**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

This sunscreen was bought in Europe. America/Canada/Australia/Asia might have a different version of this sunscreen, because of the country’s different restrictions on UV filters and sunscreen criteria (especially American sunscreens). These versions are not always equal, both in UV protection and cosmetic elegance. It also turns out that I have bought two versions of this sunscreen: A new and an older version. I actually bought the newest version first – and I loved it. I couldn’t understand how people hated it (the skincare community is very split when it comes to the Shaka fluid). Of course, everyone’s skin is difference and can have a lot to say on how a sunscreen feels and behaves on the skin. It’s a fluid, so you have to shake it thoroughly. It takes a little bit longer to apply, since it’s a fluid. It dries down matte, and you can’t see that you’re wearing anything. Easy peasy. Its biggest downfall is the prize (I bought it on sale) and that it only comes in a tiny 50ml, so you can’t buy it in bulk, so to speak. But this was the newest version (as of this year)… and then I ended up accidently buying the older version online (which might still be in production?), and oh boy, was that a different experience! Not dry-touch, but oily! They looked so similar, but I instantly felt the difference on my face, because it didn’t dry down. Absolutely horrible in comparison, I felt so gross. You can tell the new version from the old from the packaging: The newest version has “ANTI-OXYDANT” written underneath the “UVB + UVA” text. It has a similar texture as the Piz Buin mentioned above, but I personally think the Piz Buin is superior in texture: even more dry-touch. But the shaka outshines almost all sunscreens in terms of UVB and UVA protection, and it doesn’t have any irritating fragrance to boot. I thought this would be my final HG sunscreen, because it couldn’t get any better in terms of UV protection and cosmetic elegance.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5 (new “ANTI-OXYDANT” version, 2019) (old version: 4/5, because it still has great UV protection, okay?)\n\n**EVY TECHNOLOGY SUNSCREEN MOUSSE SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl. OZ**\n* \\- **Probably suitable for darker skin tones**\n* \\- **Sweden**\n* \\- **Ingredients:** Aqua. Butane. Octocrylene. Propylene glycol. Palmitic acid.

Propane.\n* \\- **UV filters (organic):** Octocrylene (UVB, short wave UVA), Uvinul A Plus (UVA), Avobenzone (UVA), Tinosorb S (UVB and UVA), Uvinul T 150 (UVB)\n* \\- **Pros:** Excellent UV protection, 5 Boots stars, very water resistant, hydrating texture, antioxidants\n* \\- **Cons:** Difficult to measure amount of sunscreen, some stickiness when overapplied\n* \\- **Review:** This is my Holy grail sunscreen. I found it. Perfect texture, high UV protection, and relatively affordable. It also comes in a 100 ml bottle, not a 50 ml, which I appreciate. According to EVY, their sunscreens work differently than other sunscreens, because they don’t lay on top of your skin and form a film, but instead they sink into the skin (stratum corneum, I presume). Because of this, they’re very water resistant and sturdy. You shake the bottle, turn it upside down, and squeeze out a golf ball-sized blob of mousse. (This mousse holds its shape pretty well and you can play with it.) Then I just rub the mousse into my face: first it turns into a light-weight white cream… and then it disappears into the skin. After a couple of minutes, there is no trace of it, but if I’ve applied to much there might be some stickiness. It certainly feels like it sinks into the skin, because it’s very hydrating. The other sunscreens I’ve liked, I’ve liked for their dry-touch finish, but with EVY I don’t need to worry about it, because I can’t feel it on my face when I touch (well, technically my face feels like it’s been hydrated) and it doesn’t do anything when I sweat. A Youtuber reviewed EVY and said that the Boots star system is only marketing – it’s not. While we have a universal measurement of UVB: SPF, we’ve later realised that UVA also causes skin damage and cancer, but we still haven’t been able to agree on one universal measurement or requirement. The Boots Star Rating system with a maximum of 5 stars requires much higher UVA protection than the European Recommendation, where the UVA protection only needs to be 1/3 of the SPF. Gothamista, however, really liked EVY. It has no fragrance, but a light aerosol smell that goes away. Because of the packaging, no preservatives are needed. It also contains some antioxidants. I’m already on my third bottle of EVY, and I will continue to purchase it in the future.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5\n\nSome sunscreens I’ve heard good things about and might want to try one day: Anessa sunscreens, Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50 PA ++++, Ultrasun sunscreens, Bioderma Photoderm Max Cream SPF50+.",

However, it does not always get rid of everything on the first try, so another cleanse may be necessary.\n\n**Repurchase?** No. It did not bother my sensitive skin too much, but I'm cutting out all essential oils from my skincare + not effective enough as a first cleanser.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Naive Botanical Olive Cleansing Oil 230mL / 7.8 oz\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ovky561y6251.png?width=207&format=png&auto=webp&s=fecf9195af66872bce90dabfe904de2a500678a5\n\nI found out about this [here, ranked #4](https://my-best.net/15468).

Even at double the price for me in the US, I have had this since **July 2019** (June 2020 now) and I am only *halfway through* it because of how incredibly effective it is with small amounts. I would run out of other cleansing oils relatively fast because of how much it takes to remove all my layers of waterproof makeup. Am shocked tbh.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, ethylhexyl palmitate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, glyceryl tri (caprylic acid / capric acid), PEG-8 glyceryl isostearate, sorbeth tetraisostearate-30, olive leaf extract, olive fruit oil, squalane, BG Water, cyclohexane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid bisethoxy diglycol, **perfume.**\n\n**Texture:** A cleansing oil of medium thickness, not overly greasy. Smooth, spreads very easily. Not super thin like something like Kose Softymo Speedy.\n\n**Efficacy:** Not drying at all on my very dry skin. SUPER effective at removing waterproof sunscreen and makeup. Takes absolutely NO TIME AT ALL, which is very different from other cleansing oils that required me to massage it in for a while. Color me beyond impressed. This is honestly the best first cleanser I've used so far. ZERO residue of any trace of makeup after removal.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes and no. It did not bother me personally but it does contain fragrance. I'm unsure if the current ingredient list is accurate as the Japanese ranking site states it contains essential oils but the list from Yesstyle does not.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy, woodsy. Not so strong that it is super bothersome.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Absolutely. As soon as it becomes affordable again when the pandemic dies down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Moistage W Cold Cream 270g / 9.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tcxvpzp1y6251.jpg?width=249&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0996cc355ecab1a721c0c6316ef76089e89c8b6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q416df74y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd8cd5a3d8cf58c3c0822eb9da142611c5826bc\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $16 on eBay. Currently about $19 on [Yesstyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/kracie-moistage-w-cold-cream-270g/info.html/pid.1069419619). Very cost-effective bc of its huge size.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, water, polysorbate 65, microcrystalline wax, glycerin, DPG, glyceryl stearate, dimethicone, stearoyl glutamate Na, stearic acid, polysorbate 80, beeswax, xanthan gum, olive oil, squalane, hydrogenated castor oil hydroxystearate, silk extract , Ethanol, hydrolyzed collagen, cetearyl alcohol, EDTA2Na, methyl paraben, ethyl paraben\\*\\*, perfume.\\*\\*\n\n**Texture:** A rich, thick white cream.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a huge NO from me, dawg. This is terrible. It barely removes anything waterproof and leaves a heavy residue. However, if you're the type of person who doesn't mind using a more stripping cleanser afterward to wash this off, or using a washcloth, I guess I can see it as being, um. Acceptable?\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** It is gentle but slightly fragranced. No reaction from my skin other than disgust at being left in a thick film after wash off.\n\n**Scent:** Very light floral.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** YES.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter 76g / 2.7 Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/znms9m83y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45f6d28d2958c8133b26a2ab363b88bcf71d065e\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $13.65 on Amazon. Currently [$14.85 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F165210/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea  (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, **Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene,** Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Citric Acid.\n\n**Texture:** A thick, opaque white balm, not overly greasy or waxy.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a good first cleanser. Quite travel friendly but I have not traveled with it in weather that would melt it so I don't know if it would leak through. It removes everything quite well, no complaints here. It still is not as good as the Kracie botanical olive one, takes longer to break down sunscreen and makeup, and may leave behind a slight amount of waterproof mascara if you aren't thorough enough with massaging/letting it sit on the skin long enough to melt everything.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Has not bothered mine, but fragrance is pretty strong. \n\n**Scent:** Strong floral. Although not strong enough to CHOKE on like some Korean products - those of intimate with Korean skincare - you know what I'm talking about. /sideyes my mom's side of the skincare in the bathroom\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** No, I don't like the scent and the packaging. It's hard to close properly on first try. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# (Not A First Cleanser But) [Equate Eye Makeup Remover](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Beauty-Oil-Free-Eye-Makeup-Remover-5-5-oz/39139097) 5.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfnqtmh5y6251.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05638b521fa8a76a4fe2673625e2b750241a492f\n\n**Cost:** $4 \n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Chloride, Dipropylene Glycol, Poloxamer 182, Allantion, Tetrasodium Edta, Benzalkonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cucumber (Cucumis Sativus), Fruit Extract, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium Phosphate. \n\n**Texture:** You gotta shake it before use. Watery but has silicone slip and thickness. \n\n**Efficacy:** I've used this as a first cleanser with a cotton pad in a pinch on extra lazy nights. It pretty works well to remove things pretty well although it WILL leave a residue obviously that you have to wash off. Honestly can't really tell the difference between this and the Neutrogena one and it's cheaper so. I use it to remove eyelash glue and waterproof mascara that I put on them. \n\nIt doesn't magically whisk away a mess of water-resistant lash glue residue + waterproof mascara on top of THAT (i don't really think anything can) but it's adequate, cheap, fragrance-free, oil-free and prolongs the wear on my beloved Miche Bloomin falsies (Girly Flair is the most popular bc of Pony Makeup but that style is horrible for me - it's SUPER fragile and breaks so easily compared to the other styles) by 10x. \n\nI just pour some in my palm and poke the lashes in a little puddle of it for a bit till the mascara comes off and then remove the glue with my fingers afterward. I don't wash them off afterward and whatever residue it leaves behind does not interfere at all with the next coat of mascara I put on them lashes.\n\n(Gonna write a separate review, but FYI - I prefer [DUO quick drying lash glue](https://www.ulta.com/duo-quick-set-lash-adhesive-clear?productId=pimprod2003529) in the purple label more than the super famous Japanese [D-Up Eyelash Fix](https://www.amazon.co.jp/D-UP-%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A2%E3%83%83%E3%83%97-4946324013622-D-U-P-%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC/dp/B0012VQTO2/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=d-up&qid=1590969259&sr=8-5) that's touted as #1 globally. I find that it's SOOO much quicker drying than D-Up and makes the lashes stick BETTER, longer, and stands stronger to tears. Plus it's latex-free too, for sensitive eyes. And way cheaper! I regret getting extra back ups of the D-Up thinking it'll be the best thing ever. There are still some cons that D-Up has an upperhand on, but I'll talk about that in that review post.)\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell yeah. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMini-Review on the **Garnier Skin Active Micellar Cleansing Water (Pink Cap):** This was just a sample so I ran out of it pretty fast but I remember being surprised that it actually was pretty effective at removing waterproof makeup. Scent-free, I quite liked it I think. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water, For Waterproof Makeup (Blue Cap), 13.5 Fl Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4fb7kb6y6251.jpg?width=556&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b56036478b358bd5043af8f80652b63a71cb7f9f\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $6.59 on Amazon. \n\n**Ingredients:** AQUA/WATER, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, ISOHEXADECANE, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DECYL GLUCOSIDE, POLYAMINOPROPYL BIGUANIDE. F.I.L.# D178190/1 \n\n**Texture:** Watery, greasy. I hate this. I got it mainly to remove waterproof sunscreen from my neck and chest at the end of the day without taking a whole damn shower. Leave a very unpleasant, greasy residue that I cannot stand on my skin. No. \n\n**Efficacy:** I only tried removing my makeup with this several times and it was okay I think. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Definitely. \n\n**Repurchase?** No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Sensibio H2O 500 ml / 16.7 fl oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3q1ucyc8y6251.jpg?width=443&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffe3ed17780adf84d930a94d27ae29416decdc52\n\n**Cost:** $15 on Amazon.com\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (aqua), Peg-6 Caprylic/capric Glycerides, Cucumis Sativus (cucumber) Fruit Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Propylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Cetrimonium Bromide. \n\n**Texture:** Watery, very light! Refreshing. Doesn't leave a greasy gross residue like above. I still splash water on top of the skin before toweling off and I still can feel a slight film. Ideally, I would like to wash it all off bc Lab Muffin says it's still not the best to leave surfactants on the skin, but most nights I can't be bothered and it shouldn't be *that* bad if people in places with harsh water just leave it on the skin, right? \n\nI guess a way to deal with that would be to wipe away using a toner/water/spray with a cotton pad or something but idk, that's more unnecessary garbage I feel. And more rubbing sensitive skin. \n\n**Efficacy:** This is fairly new. Got it for the same reason as the Garnier blue cap. It removes my waterproof sunscreen from my neck just fine with a baby wipe or cotton pad. But for everyday, I much prefer a cleansing oil to reduce the amount of tugging and rubbing on my skin as well as disposable wipes or pads. I tried it for removing waterproof mascara from my falsies like the Equate one, but it was okay, similar, but not as good and not as \"conditioning\" on my falsies to keep them soft. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** For me, yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** Yes! \n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext on my Wish List!!:\n\n\\- Muji Sensitive Cleansing Oil 400 ml\n\n\\- Muji Mild Cleansing Oil 400 ml \n\n\\- Muji Mild Milky Cleansing 200 ml \n\n\\- More cleansing gels (first cleansers NOT second cleansers) (I've tried Kikumasamune one before and I really liked that one for heavy, non-waterproof makeup days! Also Innisfree Jeju Bija cleansing gel - but this dried my skin out a bit when used as a LONE first cleanser but for some odd reason was fine when followed up with an actual second cleanser! So strange. That was years ago tho. Much earlier than Kiku.)\n\n\\- DHC Deep Cleansing Oil\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------\n\nHope that helps! \n\n(Ugh I have so many review posts and other posts I wanna write and I can't get them off my mind but I gotta wait for the big sunscreen & ceramide/pseudo-ceramide/urea creams review posts bc I'm so damn extra and gotta wait til I can take more Before & After photos months apart and compare winter vs summer performances. /eyeroll \n\nBUT I WANNA TALK ABOUT MORE SKINCARE RIGHT NOOOWWW SDKFJSD32kfd#@! But don't want to make claims or claim favs without *absolute* thorough testing either.. Sigh, the struggle!!!)",

Skip if entirely indoors.\n\n🌙 PM: \n+ DIY cleansing balm (if wearing makeup)\n+ Simple Refreshing Face Wash\n+ Solved SOS Hypochlorous Acid Spray\n+ Aziderm gel 15% (⚠️ prescription product) OR Minimalist AHA BHA 10% exfoliator OR Minimalist 3% Tranexamic Acid Face Serum (or a skip day if I feel my skin needs it)\n+ Dermadew Aloe cream with a pinch of Purenso Colloidal Oatmeal powder mixed in (also over the lips)\n+ 100% lanolin as an occlusive balm - dabbed on the lips, healing acne spots, and (only if sleeping in AC) a thin overall layer by rubbing between the palms and gently pressing all over the face.\n\nNote that I built up to this routine of actives by introducing them one at a time, over the course of several weeks.\n\n♦️ **Age:** Early 30s\n\n♦️ **Usage timeline:** just under a month.\n\nAbout 4-5 spritzes, used every day, morning and night. I'm about halfway through the bottle, I think.\n\n#✨️Ingredient list: \nAqua, Butylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Hydrolyzed Rhodophyceae Extract, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Saccharide Isomerate, Aqua, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Glycerin, Trehalose, Urea, Serine, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Algin, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Pullulan, Disodium Phosphate, Potassium Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, Hypochlorous Acid, Disodium EDTA\n\n0.5 hypochlorous acid, which [is soothing and supports the skin barrier](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/ingredient-spotlight/hypochlorous-acid-for-skin.html). They've formulated it with some nice barrier supporting ingredients like urea and polysaccharides. Knew I had to try it when I heard about it - shoutout to u/thesoapmaker_ for the tip off 🥰\n\nHypochlorous acid is the key ingredient in the SOS Daily rescue spray from the brand Tower28, a product that's been popular online for years, but their's is actually just a plain water solution. So the name may be the same, but the product isn't!\n\n♦️ **Price:** MRP ₹700 for 100ml\n\n#✨️Texture, consistency and fragrance\n\n[TEXTURE AND PACKAGING SHOTS.](https://imgur.com/a/uJWaEZi)\n\n(Pictured the amount I would use for face and neck. My efforts at photography did not extend to trying to capture the mist on camera 😂)\n\n♦️ Fragrance - none. Sniffing it closely, it does have a very faint vaguely sweetish smell, but its not something you register at all.\n\n♦️ Consistency - feels just like water, but ✨️silkier✨️\n\n♦️ Packaging - handy little opaque black plastic spray bottle with a rounded plastic cap to go over the nozzle. \n\nThe label and bottle are very cute ☺️ The spray nozzle is pretty standard, I didn't find it to be particularly fine OR too much like a jet/droplets. Suited to the purpose. Sturdy and good quality enough to do a half-spritz 👍🏼\n\n#✨️Application & finish\n\nI've never been a fan of spray toners with actives in, because you gotta be careful with avoiding the eye area and getting it up your nose. It does feel weird if you spray it over your nose 😂 And does sting slightly if you get it in your eyes.\n\nBut one spritz per cheek, forehead and chin is pretty easy to spread around and pat in. My skin is usually mildly dehydrated, and it sinks in pretty fast, leaving a very light film of hydration. Perfectly comfortable to use even in summer humidity, and I really like that it's not just like water.\n\nI find that my azelaic acid, which can be hard to spread on bare skin, goes on much smoother over this.\n\n#✨️My experience\n\nI found it a nice addition to my routine because of the hydration, and although it made no difference to my hormonal acne, I do think my skin barrier is slightly more resilient now. I usually have some mild redness around my nose corners (common,especially for people with sensitive skin), and that seems to have reduced slightly. I also think my clogged pores are slightly less likely to get inflamed now, but that might be wishful thinking 🙃\n\nMy real test was that I used it on my dog's belly rash, and it worked great 😂 He tends to develop a little skin irritation in summer, and makes it worse by licking and worrying at it (so relatable). I'd eventually have to put him in a cone and use a medicated spray on it, but this time I used the SOS spray to treat it before it got worse. Sinks in fast, no smell (so he doesn't feel motivated to lick it off) or residue/buildup. And it did heal up within a few daily applications! 🙌🏼\n\nWhich of the ingredients helped is informed speculation, as always, but I'm glad it worked. Also, I'm not suggesting it for use on your pets, just sharing what I did 👀\n\n#✨️ Final thoughts\n\nWorth a purchase if you have sensitive and/or acne-prone skin, and it's within your budget. Would suit all skin types, and work in all weather, since it's super lightweight. \n\nWould resolve only the mildest of dehydration, so I wouldn't call it a hydrating toner per se. But it's certainly more hydrating than a plain hydrosol/water extract, and I really appreciate that. Has a nice _conditioning_ quality. \n\n♦️ **Repurchase status:**\n\n~~WRP, just to have on hand. If only for my dog 😂 And to use it before azelaic acid. I'll probably skip using it after I'm done and see if I miss it.~~ See concerns below in the edit.\n\nHope this was interesting and/or useful. Byee!\n\nEdit: shoutout to u/DegreeHistorical6532 for [pointing out that](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/SRunBIlZof) the percentage is _way_ higher than recommended. I wouldn't suggest anyone purchase this product any more, it seems the formulation IS in fact too good to be true 💀 [Details about why it's iffy here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/l21fRHTYIU)\n\n#UPDATE\n\nI believe that the hypochlorous acid has started to either degrade (to irritating sodium hypochlorite) or cause irritation because of the percentage (MUCH higher than recommended percentage for use on skin) - or both. Haven't changed anything else in my routine, am experiencing stinging from barrier damage 🫠 \n\n**WOULD NOT REPURCHASE, DO NOT CONSIDER IT SAFE FOR USE.**",

    "body": "Last week someone made a post about this sunscreen and since nobody seemed to have tried it, i ordered it and want to share my experiences in my first review.\n\nStarting with the main reason i bought it: This sunscreen has a UVAPF of 73.5!!! which is even stronger than the P20 Riemann Kids which is also quite popular on this sub because of its high UVA protection and cosmetically elegance/great filters etc.\n\nThis suncreen has only filters of the new generation, so no octinoxate, octocrylen or other not so great filters that can break down easily or are hormonal active. It also does not contain avobenzone like a lot of french brand sunscreens. Avobenzone is a great UV-filter but it breaks down when exposed to the sun (when it is not stabilized) and it seems to burn on the eye lids for some individuals. Additonally it is alcohol free!\n\nComplete Ingredient List:\n\nAQUA, DIBUTYL ADIPATE, DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE,  GLYCERIN, METHYLENE BIS-BENZOTRIAZOLYL TETRAMETHYLBUTYLPHENOL (NANO),  TRIS-BIPHENYL TRIAZINE (NANO), UNDECANE, BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE, DECYL  GLUCOSIDE, TRIDECANE, SODIUM STEAROYL GLUTAMATE, OLEA EUROPAEA LEAF  EXTRACT, ASCORBYL GLUCOSIDE, ZINC PCA, ASCORBIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, DISODIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, ACRYLATES/BEHENETH-25 METHACRYLATE COPOLYMER, DISODIUM  EDTA, SODIUM BENZOATE, PHENOXYETHANOL\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe texture of this sunscreen is gel-like and i would compare it to the heliocare gel oil free spf 50 but a bit more moisturizing. It leaves a very slight white cast but it isnt noticable at all and i can even wear it under dark facial hair (my skin is Type II on the Fitzpatrick Scale). So far i wore it 4 days in a row and it didnt break me out. I recommend Patch-Testing it first (i am too impatient for that most of the times). I would say this product is best for people with normal to combo skin since it could be not enough moisturizing for people with very dry skin. The suncreen is water resistent and suited for beach days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe price at 26 euro for 50 mL is high and comparable to the Ultrasun sunscreens but in this case i think it is fair for the ingredients, the protection factor and the fact that this company seems to be very small and probably cant produce it on mass. Still i can understand people that say that this is too much and want to look out for more affordable sunscreens. The suncreen comes in a see through bottle that is stored in a much bigger box. I would suggest to store the sunscreen in this box so it is more protected against sunlight and heat that could break down ingredients.\n\nEdit: If you dont live in Italy the price will be higher throught shipping costs of 15 Euro. Inside Italy it is free if you order over 50 euro total. This is how i understood it but be free to correct me! I would suggest testing it and if you like it ordering a stock so you have to pay less shipping costs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the conclusion: I have to say i really enjoy this suncreen! It has the **EXTREME** high UVA protection, the quality ingredients and the cosmetical elegance and with that hits all boxes for me. Keep in mind that i just tried it out 4 days now and i cant say something about a long term break out. I really think it is a hidden gem that more people should try out! :)\n\nThis is where you can purchase it, it is a bit hard to find in the internet\n\n[https://normon.it/prodotto/normon-uv-cure-gel-50-ml/?lang=en](https://normon.it/prodotto/normon-uv-cure-gel-50-ml/?lang=en)",

I mean that alone is worth the price of admission for life as far as I’m concerned. It gets rid of raw onion breath instantly too. I never heard of this Closys product before.

The Cherry Berry is always sold out tho.\n\nThe cheap crest toothpaste she recommends (have to get that exact one) is way more effective than the Tom’s or Sensodyne one I was using. I still have sensitivity issues and I’m dealing with that by adding Mi Paste or the GC Tooth Mousse, after the fluoride rinse. Hope not to need it after a while. I do not think the sainsbury toothpaste is a good substitute for the Crest. Crest has trisodium phosphate and Sains doesn’t.

    "body": "Welcome to the complete guide of how to make cocaine. If you do   everything right you are going to be king of the world, either in your   own world or in the real world. Please read the disclaimer at the end of   this text.  Now, let's get to action!  The basic formula for cocaine starts by purchasing or making tropinine,   converting the tropinone into 2-carbomethoxytropinone (also known as   methyl-tropan-3-one-2-carboxylate), reducing this to ecgonine,   and changing that to cocaine.     Succindialdehyde. This can be purchased, too. 23.2 g of succinaldoxime   powder in 410 ml of 1 N sulfuric acid and add dropwise with stirring at   0\\* a solution of 27.6 g of sodium nitrite in 250 ml of water over   3 hours. After the addition, stir and let the mixture rise to room temp   for about 2 hours, taking care not to let outside air into the reaction.   Stir in 5 g of Ba carbonate and filter. Extract the filtrate with ether   and dry, evaporate in vacuo to get the succindialdehyde. This was t  aken from JOC, 22, 1390 (1957). To make succinaldoxime, see JOC, 21,   644 (1956).    Complete Synthesis of Succindialdehyde. JACS, 68, 1608 (1946). In a 2 liter   3 necked flask equipped with a stirrer, reflux condenser, and an addition   funnel, is mixed 1 liter of ethanol, 67 g of freshly distilled pyrrole, and   141 g of hydroxylamine hydrochloride. Heat to reflux until dissolved, add   106 g of anhydrous sodium carbonate in small portions as fast as reaction   will allow. Reflux for 24 hours and filter the mixture. Evaporate the   filtrate to dryness under vacuo. Take up the residue in the minimum amount   of boiling water, decolorize with carbon, filter and allow to recrystallize   in refrigerator. Filter to get product and concentrate to get additional   crop. Yield of succinaldoxime powder is a little over 40 g, mp is 171-172\\*.    5.8 g of the above powder is placed in a beaker of 250 ml capacity and   54 ml of 10% sulfuric acid is added. Cool to 0\\* and add in small portions   of 7 g of sodium nitrite (if you add the nitrite too fast, nitrogen dioxide   fumes will evolve). After the dioxime is completely dissolved, allow the   solution to warm to 20\\* and effervescence to go to completion. Neutralize   the yellow solution to litmus by adding small portions of barium carbonate.   Filter off the barium sulfate that precipitates. The filtrate is 90% pure   succindialdehyde and is not purified further for the reaction to create   tropinone. Do this procedure 3 more times to get the proper amount for the   next step, or multiply the amounts given by four and proceed as described   above.    Take the total amount of succinaldehyde (obtained from 4 of the above   syntheses combined) and without further treatment or purification (this had   better be 15.5 g of succindialdehyde) put into an Erlenmeyer flask of   4-5 liters capacity. Add 21.6 g of methylamine hydrochloride, 46.7 g of   acetonedicarboxylic acid, and enough water to make a total volume of 2   liters. Adjust the pH to 8-10 by slowly adding a saturated solution of   disodium phosphate. The condensate of this reaction (allow to set for   about 6 days) is extracted with ether, the ethereal solution is dried   over sodium sulphate and distilled, the product coming over at 113\\* at   25 mm of pressure is collected. Upon cooling, 14 g of tropinone   crystallizes in the pure state.    2-Carbomethoxytropinone. A mixture of 1.35 g of sodium methoxide   (this is sodium in a minimum amount of methanol), 3.5 g of tropinone,   4 ml of dimethylcarbonate and 10 ml of toluene is refluxed for 30 min.   Cool to 0\\* and add 15 ml of water that contains 2.5 g of ammonium chloride.   Extract the solution after shaking with with four 50 ml portions of   chloroform, dry, evaporate the chloroform in vacuo. Dissolve the oil   residue in 100 ml of ether, wash twice with a mixture of 6 ml of   saturated potassium carbonate and three ml of 3 N KOH. Dry and evaporate   in vacuo to recover the unreacted tropinone. Take up the oil in a solution   of aqueous ammonium chloride and extract with chloroform, dry, and evaporate   in vacuo to get an oil. The oil is dissolved in hot acetone, cool, and   scratch inside of flask with glass rod to precipitate   2-carbomethoxytropinone. Recrystallize 16 g of this product in 30 ml of hot   methyl acetate and add 4 ml of cold water and 4 ml of acetone. Put in   freezer for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Filter and wash the precipitate with cold   methyl acetate to get pure product.    Methylecgonine. 0.4 mole of tropinone is suspended in 80 ml of ethanol   in a Parr hydrogenation flask (or something that can take 100 psi and not   react with the reaction, like stainless steel or glass). 10 g of Raney   Nickle is added with good agitation (stirring or shaking) followed by   2-3 ml of 20% NaOH solution. Seal vessel, introduce 50 psi of hydrogen   atmosphere (after flushing vessel with hydrogen) and heat to 40-50\\*.   After no more uptake of hydrogen (pressure gauge will hold steady after   dropping to its lowest point) bleed off pressure and filter the nickle off,   rinse out bottle with chloroform and use this rinse to rinse off the nickle   while still on the filter paper. Make the filtrate basic with KOH after   cooling to 10\\*. Extract with chloroform dry, and evaporate the chloroform   in vacuo to get an oil. Mix the oil plus any precipitate with an equal   volume of dry ether and filter. Add more dry ether to the filtrate until   no more precipitate forms, filter and add to the rest of the precipetate.   Recrystallize from isopropanol to get pure methylecgonine. Test for activity.   If active, skip down to the step for cocaine. If not active, proceed as   follows. Stir with activated carbon for 30 min, filter, evaporate in vacuo,   dissolve the brown liquid in methanol, and neutralize with 10% HCl acid in   dry ether. Evaporate the ether until the two layers disappear, and allow to   stand for 2 hours at 0\\* to precipitate the title product. There are many   ways to reduce 2-carbomethoxytropinone to methylecgonine. I chose to design   a Raney Nickle reduction because it is cheap and not as suspicious as LAH   and it is much easier than zinc or sodium amalgams.    Cocaine. 4.15 g of methylecgonine and 5.7 g of benzoic anhydride in 150 ml   of dry benzene are gently refluxed for 4 hours taking precaution against   H20 (the 2 should be on a lower level) in the air (drying tube). Cool in an   ice bath, acidify carefully with hydrochloric acid, dry, and evaporate in a   vacuum to get a red oil which is treated with a little portion of isopropanol   to precipitate cocaine.    As you can see, this is quite a chore. The coca leaves give ecgonine, which   as you can see, is only a jump away from cocaine. If you can get egconine,   then dissolve 8 1/2 g of it in 100 ml of ethanol and pass (bubble) dry HC1   gas through this solution for 30 min. Let cool to room temp and let stand   for another 1 1/2 hours. Gently reflux for 30 min and evaporate in vacuo.   Basify the residue oil with NaOH and filter to get 8.4 g of methylecgonine,   which is converted to cocaine as in the cocain step above.    Below is given a somewhat easier method of producing tropinone by the   general methods of Willstatter, who was instrumental in the first synthetic   production of cocaine and several other alkaloids. After reviewing this   method, I found it to be simpler than the above in many respects.    Tropinone. 10 g of pyrrolidinediethyl diacetate are heated with 10 g of   cymene and 2 g of sodium powder, the reaction taking place at about 160\\*.   During the reaction (which is complete in about 10 min) the temp should not   exceed 172\\*. The resulting reaction product in dissolved in water, then   saturated with potassium carbonate, and the oil, which separates, is boiled   with dilute sulfuric acid. 2.9 g of tropinone picrate forms and is filtered.  Here are two more formulas devised by Willstatter that produce tropinone   from tropine. Take note of the yield differences.    Tropinone. To a solution of 25 g tropine, dissolved in 10 times its weight   of 20% sulfuric acid are added 25 g of a 4% solution of potassiumpermanganate   in 2 or 3 g portions over 45 min while keeping the temp at 10-12\\*. The   addition of permanganate will cause heat (keep the temp 10-12\\*) and   precipitation of manganese dioxide. The reaction mixture is complete in   1 hour. A large excess of NaOH is added and the reaction is steam distilled   until 1 liter of distillate has been collected. The tropinone is   isolated as the dibenzal compound by mixing the distillate with 40 g of   benzaldehyde in 500 cc of alcohol and 40 of 10% sodium hydroxide solution.   Let stand several days to get dibenzaltropinone as yellow needles.   Yield: 15.5 g, 28%. Recrystallize from ethanol to purify.    Tropinone. A solution of 12 g of chromic acid in the same amount of   water (12 g) and 60 g of glacial acetic acid is added dropwise with stirring",

        "body": "Welcome to the complete guide of how to make cocaine. If you do   everything right you are going to be king of the world, either in your   own world or in the real world. Please read the disclaimer at the end of   this text.  Now, let's get to action!  The basic formula for cocaine starts by purchasing or making tropinine,   converting the tropinone into 2-carbomethoxytropinone (also known as   methyl-tropan-3-one-2-carboxylate), reducing this to ecgonine,   and changing that to cocaine.     Succindialdehyde. This can be purchased, too. 23.2 g of succinaldoxime   powder in 410 ml of 1 N sulfuric acid and add dropwise with stirring at   0\\* a solution of 27.6 g of sodium nitrite in 250 ml of water over   3 hours. After the addition, stir and let the mixture rise to room temp   for about 2 hours, taking care not to let outside air into the reaction.   Stir in 5 g of Ba carbonate and filter. Extract the filtrate with ether   and dry, evaporate in vacuo to get the succindialdehyde. This was t  aken from JOC, 22, 1390 (1957). To make succinaldoxime, see JOC, 21,   644 (1956).    Complete Synthesis of Succindialdehyde. JACS, 68, 1608 (1946). In a 2 liter   3 necked flask equipped with a stirrer, reflux condenser, and an addition   funnel, is mixed 1 liter of ethanol, 67 g of freshly distilled pyrrole, and   141 g of hydroxylamine hydrochloride. Heat to reflux until dissolved, add   106 g of anhydrous sodium carbonate in small portions as fast as reaction   will allow. Reflux for 24 hours and filter the mixture. Evaporate the   filtrate to dryness under vacuo. Take up the residue in the minimum amount   of boiling water, decolorize with carbon, filter and allow to recrystallize   in refrigerator. Filter to get product and concentrate to get additional   crop. Yield of succinaldoxime powder is a little over 40 g, mp is 171-172\\*.    5.8 g of the above powder is placed in a beaker of 250 ml capacity and   54 ml of 10% sulfuric acid is added. Cool to 0\\* and add in small portions   of 7 g of sodium nitrite (if you add the nitrite too fast, nitrogen dioxide   fumes will evolve). After the dioxime is completely dissolved, allow the   solution to warm to 20\\* and effervescence to go to completion. Neutralize   the yellow solution to litmus by adding small portions of barium carbonate.   Filter off the barium sulfate that precipitates. The filtrate is 90% pure   succindialdehyde and is not purified further for the reaction to create   tropinone. Do this procedure 3 more times to get the proper amount for the   next step, or multiply the amounts given by four and proceed as described   above.    Take the total amount of succinaldehyde (obtained from 4 of the above   syntheses combined) and without further treatment or purification (this had   better be 15.5 g of succindialdehyde) put into an Erlenmeyer flask of   4-5 liters capacity. Add 21.6 g of methylamine hydrochloride, 46.7 g of   acetonedicarboxylic acid, and enough water to make a total volume of 2   liters. Adjust the pH to 8-10 by slowly adding a saturated solution of   disodium phosphate. The condensate of this reaction (allow to set for   about 6 days) is extracted with ether, the ethereal solution is dried   over sodium sulphate and distilled, the product coming over at 113\\* at   25 mm of pressure is collected. Upon cooling, 14 g of tropinone   crystallizes in the pure state.    2-Carbomethoxytropinone. A mixture of 1.35 g of sodium methoxide   (this is sodium in a minimum amount of methanol), 3.5 g of tropinone,   4 ml of dimethylcarbonate and 10 ml of toluene is refluxed for 30 min.

    "body": "i've been spending a little time comparing active/inactive ingredients and have the following to share if it's of any interest to anyone. please note i'm not a chemist so take everything with a grain of salt (no pun intended).\n\nSo the whole BPI year BUD thing really bugs me without any show of evidence to back up their claims. Nonetheless, i figured i'd take a look at zepbound, BPI, and Olympia and see if i could find any similarities that may or may not indicate longer term peptide stability.\n\nThe short of it is zepbound is on an island alone. They don't use lyophilized (freeze dried) API. They have a more stable form of API with proprietary buffering that lends itself to the long BUD.\n\nTaking a look at the 503B inactives, I found that BPI's formulation (allegedly Tirzepatide, Disodium Phosphate Dihydrate, Sodium Chloride, Benzyl Alcohol, and Water for Injection) has the more stable version disodium phosphate dihydrate vs. Olympia's formula which uses the more reactive sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous. These act as buffering agents to maintain the solution's pH which is imperative for long term stability.\n\nThese buffering agents are what's missing out of the 503A formularies. Hence, the shorter shelf life. Without a pH controlled environment the tirzepatide is in sterile water, which has a lower pH than the 503B buffered version.\n\nThey all (except zepbound) have benzyl alcohol (1-2%) for reduced bacteria proliferation risk. + Injection site reactions.\n\nThen I considered bottle fill volumes. Looking at peoples' pictures, it looks like BPI provides a smaller vial, with a larger fill volume; compared to Olympia's rather large vials with low fill volume. I do not know if either of these pharmacies nitrogen purge (Olympia confirmed they do Not), but either way there's a whole lot more room for oxidation in those Olympia vials.\n\nBPI. Now, these folks will not share COAs or third party assessments (I've tried, multiple times). I find this particularly off-putting for a high priced, INJECTABLE medication. Endotoxins? Percentage of tirzepatide actually present per ml? Nope, we don't get to know what we're paying for.\n\nOlympia did send me a COA out of their last batch, 3/19/25. Endotoxin, good. pH 7.6 (zep pH 6.5-7.5), fair. Tirzepatide 96.2%/ml. (for comparison, Brello's 1/25 COA 98% tirzepatide/ml. no pH info though likely fair for longer term storage).\n\nBPI-most recent FDA report, fine. Olympia-most recent FDA report, yikes! [https://www.fda.gov/media/180579/download](https://www.fda.gov/media/180579/download)\n\nMy intent in all of this was to identify the most worthwhile use of my money.\n\nFor a short term stock, i still think brello and RR are good buys (although RR costs \\~125% more and presents greater oxidation risks re: vial size and fill volume). Additionally, Olympia is also a great shorter term buy for something with no additives given this COA report. And for the alleged 12 month BPI BUD, i've now changed my BPI tune and am considering buying ($5.83/mg vs. zep $12.50/mg).\n\nTLDR: I was hoping to decide that Olympia vials with their 8/25 BUD could in theory last 12 months, but since reading into some things, i've decided that's not a worthwhile gamble. (But the COA report was fine and with a four month buy + the discount code, their pricing per mg is Very close to Brello's right now - and you'd likely get it shipped much sooner considering Brello's Mochi mess).\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gUnoMRwFJh1rJpBqH6gQzRKncUlr2mBv/view?usp=drivesdk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gUnoMRwFJh1rJpBqH6gQzRKncUlr2mBv/view?usp=drivesdk)",

They are so well shot and fully of \"science\" that it's too difficult to not be influenced into buying these products which are touted as high end skincare. I bought these on Christmas sale some 3 years ago- these are limited edition size. The black friday/ Christmas sales are the only times these products go on sale. The company does not usually discount the off-the rack products but rather brings out limited edition packaging each year which has reduced per ml cost but you spend more as these are sold as bundles. 10/10 for very savvy marketing.\n\nDetails: 35F living in North India, product used during summer months, lasted around 3-4 months. Skin type is oily but no skin concerns except for 1-2 cystic acne per year that leave dark spots. \n\nProducts are serum like, transparent and fragrance free. \n\nProducts used in conjunction with facewash and moisturiser, neither with any actives.\n\nComing to the products themselves:\n\nThe formulae from the website:\n\nHyaluid- Formula\n\nErythritol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caesalpinia Spinosa Fruit Extract, Chlorphenesin, Niacinamide, Betaine, Allantoin, Kappaphycus Alvarezii Extract, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Asiaticoside, Glycerin, Adenosine, Xylitylglucoside, Ethylhexylglycerin, Anhydroxylitol, Butylene Glycol, Dextrin, Xylitol, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Elastin, Glucose, Pentylene Glycol, Cynanchum Atratum Extract, Sodium Chloride, Madecassoside, Sodium Deoxycholate, Disodium Phosphate, Sodium Phosphate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, sr-(Oligopeptide-91 Clostridium Botulinum Polypeptide-1), Polysorbate 20, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Lecithin, Phosphatidylcholine, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Copper Tripeptide-1 , Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Potassium Hyaluronate, sh-Oligopeptide-2, sh-Polypeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-2\n\nMarketed as \"comprehensive longevity supplement\", this is a peptide serum along with 8 molecular sizes of hyaluronic acid.\n\nhttps://slurplaboratories.com/products/hyaluid\n\nNiacid\n\nGalactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Illicium Verum (Anise) Fruit Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Hamamelis Virginiana Extract, Pentasodium Tetracarboxymethyl Acetylhydroxyprolyl Dipeptide-12, Pentasodium Tetracarboxymethyl Dipeptide-51, Sodium Hyaluronate, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Prunus Mume Fruit Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Brassica Oleracea Capitata Leaf Extract, Sodium Guaiazulene Sulfonate\n\nMarketed as \"universal complexion distillate\", it has galactomyces, niacinamide, snail secretion and tranexamic acid.\n\nMy experience:\n\nThe experience of using them is not distinctly luxurious. The serums feel tacky on my oily skin, as do most other serums. The niacinamide foams as do other niacinamide products on my skin. I have never experienced any visible effects from using any peptide and niacinamide products (my skin is generally in quite good form) but I persist on keeping them in my routine as I understand that they are researched backed for keeping skin looking and feeling nice. \n\nThey have not disclosed % of key ingredients. \n\nI think Korean toners like cosrx snail and galactomyces, purito boosting essence, numbuzin no3 toner can all give similar results as niacid claims. For peptides, the ordinary's peptide serums are good alternatives.\n\nNiacid seems expensive when compared to the other alternatives. Hyaluid may compare to the ordinary's peptide serums in price given that it comes in a 100ml packaging. However, I am not sure if peptides are the stars in Hyaluid given the name focuses on hyaluronic acid. \n\nI loved their glass packaging with minimal design and the company's no bullshit way of operating without frequent sales. They don't even have an insta profile. One might wonder though why there are such limited product reviews on YT. \n\nFinal verdict: undecided on product quality. Too expensive for me to keep repurchasing. WNRP",

    "body": "**I passed!!** \n\nThird time is the charm for me! My experience and advice:\n\nI graduated from my internship in May 2021, took about two months off d/t burnout. Started studying in August with only eatrightprep (provided by my internship) and took the exam mid-September, stopped at 125 questions and failed with a **19**. My subscores were 13 each (minimum of 15 each needed).\n\nMy second attempt I used a 2016 version of the inman, and really focused on memorizing management theories and equations, vitamins minerals, etc (stuff you just have to know, there's no way around it). I rewrote the inman in my own words and reviewed it a few times the week of my exam. I also used pocketprep (highly recommend) and was averaging scores of 60%. I took the exam mid-November, stopped at 145 questions and failed with a **24**. My subscore for domain I and II was 15 and for domain III and IV was 14. I was so heartbroken! \n\nThis third and final time I used the 2020 Inman and focused on the last two domains which were my weakest points, while also reviewing the first two domains. This time I really pulled everything together and knew the answer to questions without having to look at the choices (This is key!!!). I re-read the inman at least four times and created \"worksheets\" or mini study guides for major info (foodborne illnesses, lab values, ckd, cardio, etc). This forced me to focus on subjects section by section instead of domain by domain. I found this extremely helpful and much easier to grasp the material. I focused on lab values and how they are influenced by what diseases (more conceptual/situational) and really memorized what foods were good sources of certain vitamins and minerals (the easy sources won't be listed as choices). I have experienced **many** questions like, \"You have a patient with CKD and proteinuria, what foods would you not recommend\" or something like that. I continued using pocketprep, now averaging scores of 80-95%. Took the exam January 13th 2022 and stopped at 125 questions, passed with a **29**!! Subscores were 17 each!\n\nI was also worried about the new exam update. I did notice more situational questions (and very oddly specific, niche questions I have never heard of or seen anything about on my prior exams) but overall if you know the Inman front to back, the whys, the hows, and study situational questions, you'll be set!\n\nThe situational questions all comes down to knowing everything about a disease state and how it’s effected by nutrition or lab values. So if someone’s on peritoneal dialysis, what food would they want to avoid? A) Apple b) Tuna c) Grapefruit d) Sausage. Also, why would they want to avoid it? The answer is sausage, because it has disodium phosphate (which you would know from the foodservice section, the types of preservatives in different kinds of foods) and if they have too much phosphate, it is absorbed and excreted as calcium phosphate. Why is that bad? Because the calcium is being pulled from their bones (osteoclasts!) to make that happen, leaving them at a higher risk for osteoporosis or osteomalacia. They should be taking phosphate binders to reduce that. See how everything connects in that question? It’s knowing things like that but for **every** disease in the Inman guide. I rewrote each disease and it’s nutritional implications and medication interactions a dozen times, it will stick in your brain eventually! Practice really helps becoming confident with test-taking skills, because even if you don’t know the exact answer, you might be able to figure out what they want you to answer. If you feel like you know the material, do a ton of practice questions. I was overlooking or overthinking what the questions were asking, after a lot of practice you'll get great at critical thinking and strategic test taking. \n\nI was bummed when I failed the first two times, but I was also glad they hold high standards for our profession in order to pass. It makes us more credible, keep working and you will get there. \n\nI hope this helps you future RD's, happy studying!",

    "body": "Fair warning:.. this review could end up being quite lengthly, but I wanted to be thorough and detailed. (I’m also a bit of a noob when it comes to the themes and patterns of topics on /r/skincareaddiction ,.. but I’m hoping some will find this useful.)\n\nI also wanted to add: Body chemistries can be incredibly unique and individual, so the experience I’m having may not be identical or directly applicable to you. This is a Review for informational/sharing purposes, it’s not my intent for this to be a recommendation or endorsement. Mother Dirt’s website says they expect their product to work for about 60% of people. (why that specific % ?.. I have no idea. I suspect as described below, that we don’t yet fully understand what constitutes a “healthy skin biome”. ) Given that this product only have 4 ingredients.. it’s not gonna be some “miracle cure for everyone equally”. \n\nThis review is for the Mother Dirt company's product “AO+ Mist”. It is marketed as a “Probiotic spray for the skin”. It’s currently sold in a 3.4OZ spray-nozzle bottle. You can find it on Amazon for $49.95. I don’t know how that price compares to other skin-care products. As a fairly poor-person, it feels expensive to me, but as I worked through the 4-week trial and experienced how it works for me (SPOILERS AHEAD) .. I’m happy with the results and am planning to continue buying and using it. \n\nThe product only contains 4 ingredients:…  Aqua (water), Nitrosomonas eutropha (live cultured Ammonia-Oxidizing Bacteria or AOB for short), disodium phosphate, magnesium chloride.\n\nThe basic premise of the product is that the skin-biome is as important to the body as what we’re finding out about the stomach-biome. So in the way the probiotics (yogurts, kombucha,etc) bring beneficial bacteria to the stomach and digestive-tract,.. that the same is true of the Skin. The skin is the largest organ of the human body,. and Mother Dirt’s argument is that over time, the amount of chemicals we’ve gotten used to using on our body have stripped all the good bacteria away from our skin and destroyed our skin’s natural / balanced biome. Mother Dirt is honest in putting a byline on their products that says (paraphrasing): “We don’t yet know the full complexity of the skin-biome or what constitutes a “healthy skin-biome” (especially since that may differ from person to person). However the science of AOB’s is fairly well established and the mechanism of AOB’s consuming ammonia is known. This product is NOT a deoderant or anti-persperant. It’s a spray that’s supposed to work WITH your bodies natural systems. The AOB are fueled by the ammonia in your sweat.. so the more you sweat (assuming you have a healthy/strong skin-biome).. the better the AOB’s work. \n\nThe FAQ / Product Description for AO Mist reads:\n\n> \"AO+ Mist is a patented, live probiotic spray for the skin to be used after bathing, before bedtime and whenever you find convenient. The spray consists of a strain of safe live-cultured AOB (Ammonia-Oxidizing Bacteria) that consume the ammonia in your sweat and convert it into healthy components for your skin (nitric oxide and nitrite). It is a good bacteria that used to live on our skin naturally, but modern chemistry and hygiene practices have destroyed it. AOB is still found in nature, in rich soil where plants thrive.”\n\n> \"**Directions**: Simply spray on sweat-prone or problem areas as the last step your routine morning and evening.  Face, scalp, underarms, hands, feet, even privates are all great areas for use. Remember to shake the bottle each time! Feel free to experiment and see what works best for you. Many users throw it in their purse or gym bag to spritz throughout the day.”\n\n> \"**Delivery of the Product**: Depending on the season, the product will arrive with appropriate packaging and insulation (cold packs) to ensure that the bacteria are active. The packages are not meant to arrive cool, but simply protected from extreme temperatures (below 32F and above 105F). Our methods minimize time spent in temperature extremes.”\n\n> \"**Care**: Because we don't use preservatives, our products have a shelf life. The AO+ Mist is the only product that may require refrigeration due to the live AOBs. Whether you refrigerate or not will depend on how quickly you use a bottle. One bottle is best used within 6 months if kept in the fridge, or 4 weeks if kept on the bathroom shelf.” (Review Note:.. I’m 2 bottles in now.. and a single bottle is lasting me about 2 weeks. I could be over-using ?.. not sure yet). \n\n> \"**ALL OUR FORMULAS ARE**: Preservative-free, Allergy-tested, Fragrance-free, Dermatologist-reviewed, 10 ingredients or less, Sensitive-skin friendly, Plant-derived, Paraben-free, Hypoallergenic, Phthalate-free, Non-irritating, Sulfate-free, Clinically-tested, BPA-free.”\n\nA little background on me:…. \n\nI’m a 45 year old white male,. and throughout my life (teens, 20’s, 30’s).. I’ve struggled with a lot of skin challenges (allergies, sensitivities, exzema, etc). In my teens I went to a variety of dermatologists, who all independently recommended that I restrict or cease using any chemicals whatsoever. One dermatologist told me: “Your skin is as thin as tissue-paper.. and you should treat it like that.\" That advice is particularly difficult (as you all probably know), if you’re lifestyle is active or in a dirty job. What I would notice with my skin, is that frequent showering (body-wash, shampoo, ,etc,etc).. would leave my skin feeling very “traumatized” (for lack of a better word.. my skin felt “wounded” and “hurty” pretty much constantly). I would break out with scaly, dry, inflamed patches of skin (that would crack and bleed) around my nipples, elbows, finger-knuckles, .. or basically any area that was thin-skinned and exposed to normal every day physical abuses. Trying to use lotions or even organic/natural moistorizers really didn’t help any. (especially once the skin was damaged/broken). So I've really struggled for decades with that. Not only the cleansers harming my skin but on top of that the constant demand to wear deodorants or anti-persperants or other hygiene related products. Basically, any chemical I put on my body turned out to be bad for me. \n\nI had heard about probiotic / AOB’s .. a while back (2010,.. 2014 ?) .. but kind of blew them off as “hippie bullshit” (and/or “early science that wasn’t fully researched yet”) .. and ignored or avoided them because I didn’t think it was a “ready solution” yet. But I got to the point recently where I was tired of feeling like I was exhausing my options of “traditional hygiene approaches” and was borderline desperate to try something as different as possible from traditional approaches. (One thing to note about me being a fairly typical male,.. that my hygiene routine is ridiculously simple/basic. I shower and towel-dry and that’s about it (beyond tooth-brushing and flossing,etc) . I just wanted to point that out as I don’t have any of the complex layers of routine that a lot of you may have). \n\nThe bottle of AO+ Mist I ordered arrived on Thursday, Aug 9th. The recommendations are to spray twice a day and that it may take up to 4 weeks to start seeing results. In my particular situation, I do NOT have a Refrigerator at home, so I have to store my spray-bottle at work. So my typical daily-routine now goes something like this:\n\n* Wake up around 5am to 5:30am\n\n* quick shower with cool water only. I’m basically only “getting my skin wet” and splashing around a little to wake up. Towel dry and sometimes stand in front of my bedroom fan to blow-dry all the nooks and crannies. \n\n* Brush teeth and mouthwash\n\n* get dressed, come to work usually by 6:30 to 7am\n\n* grab AO+ Mist and go to the bathroom. Take off my shirt and spray AO+ Mist around my armpits, chest, neck, face, head, elbow-creases,etc. (If I think it’s gonna be an excessively hot or active day, I’ll drop my pants and spray groin and knee-creases). Try to stand there / wave shirt around to dry off. \n\n* work throughout my day, break for lunch.. work till 4pm..\n\n* leave work, buy groceries.. go home and take another quick shower with cool water.\n\n* unwind, eat dinner, tooth-brush,floss/mouthwash.. \n\n* go to bed.\n\nNormally I do not spray anytime in the afternoon or evening, so I’m only getting 1 spray-session a day in the early morning. \n\nSome things I’ve noticed while using AO+ Mist:… \n\n* That feeling of my skin being “vulnerably-thin” and achey/damaged/hurty constant seemed to change pretty rapidly. Maybe it was psychological but I swear within the first few days and especially within the 1st week I felt like my skin slowly became stronger and thicker and feeling healthier (borderline “glowing”). All of those areas that I was constantly applying chemicals to (chest, armpits, arms, groin, etc) …or the dry, scale’y, cracked, peeling, exzema-like patches on my elbows or thumb-knuckles,etc.. slowly rebounded and look natural and healthy now. \n\n* Historically, when I got sweaty.. my sweat would have this pungent, ammonia’y, acrid smell. What I notice now using AO+ Mist.. is that sharp-edge ammonia-smell is pretty much gone. There will be sort of a slight earthy nitrogen smell (makes sense, since the bacteria converts ammonia to nitrogen). Also sometimes (and I may be over-using the product).. my armpits will sometimes have sort of a “bready” / “yeasty” smell. I’m gonna chalk that up to “over-spraying”.. so I may have to find a way to spray twice a day.. instead of 1 heavy spray in the morning. Or just use less sprays. \n\n* I also notice that prior to using AO+ Mist my body's threshold for “becoming smelly” was quite short. If I woke up and showered in the morning and between 7am and 8am had to do a bunch of manual labor (moving equipment, warehouse-work,etc), I would get sweaty and ammonia-smelly by 8am very very easily. That sucks, because then you just can’t shake that ammonia-sweaty smell all day long. (and I can’t just “go home and shower every 2 hours”). What I notice using AO+ Mist is that threshold/dropoff is much higher and longer. If I spray in the morning (6:30 - 7am).. I can work pretty much however hard I want.. and I can sometimes even get through an entire day without becoming “smelly” (my body may be “wet”.. or I may have circles of sweat under my armpits or in my groin… but I don’t get smelly). I’ve been shoving my nose into my armpits 5 or 10 times a day over the past 4 week just trying to track/gauge the level of smell. If you push hard (12hrs, 14hrs, 16hr days of active work),.. you're still gonna eventually get smelly. AO+ Mist isn't some kind of \"magical forcefield\".. but it definitely dampens the \"ammonia'y\" nature of it. \n\n* So it’s kind of weird now (since I only spray in the mornings).. when I get home after a long hard day at work,.. all I do is take a quick cool shower (basically enough just to rinse off). And there’s really no noticeable smell at all. (even pressing my nose as deep into my armpit as I physically can try to do). I obviously don’t have any way to measure or scientifically test the bacteria biome on my skin.. so I can’t prove that’s what’s going on. But something seems to be working. \n\n* The 2 bottles I’ve used so far.. each bottle is lasting about 2 weeks (which is about $100 per month). I may need to look at that and figure out if I’m overusing or not. It’s hard to gauge how much Nitrosomonas eutropha is active on my skin. I was kind of hoping after the initial 4 weeks.. that I can sort of go into a “maintenance mode”.. where I only have to spray enough each day to maintain a healthy colony of Nitrosomonas eutropha across my skin. (but not being able to measure what that is.. I’m not sure how I’m gonna know when I reach that threshold). On the flip-side though, while $100 a month may sound like a lot.. it’s also true that I’ve pretty much stopped buying any other soaps or body-washes. I probably wasn’t spending $100 a month on those.. but they were damaging my skin (or just flat out making my issues worse).. so while I’m probably paying more now, I think I have a better / healthier solution too. \n\nI think for me.. the explanation that Mother Dirt markets that \"We have to re-think our definition of \"clean\"\" ... and that we have to change our habits to try to work WITH our skin and allow it to develop a healthy bacteria biome,.. was something I was not so much skeptical as just ignorant of and didn't understand. I feel like now, after a month of using the product.. I have a much better understanding of what they are going for there. \n\nIt's not a miracle product and I can't say it's gonna be perfectly effective for everyone. For me (especially being a simple guy who has a really simple hygiene routine).. this type of product seems to fit me pretty well. I've love to see the science of this improve even more. If there was some way I could take a swab/test (like 23&Me or UBiome) of my skin.. and send it in and have them create a customized mixture of the right bacteria for me.. that would be some awesome science-fiction shit right there. \n\nAnyways.. this is long enough now. Questions ?... \n\n",

Its a very 'dirty hippie' thing. But people can also seem to build up their microbiome by just severely limiting their product usage. You can build up your skin to tolerate not needing washed (except maybe pits n private bits, hands n feet, hair if you're lucky) except with plain water and maybe a wash cloth or something. Doesn't work for everyone though.\n\nI would also recommend getting a microfiber towel or something smoother/softer and just patting dry instead of rubbing. Also, try to air dry as much as you can. You can kind of pat in/slap the water on your skin to make it absorb/evaporate faster. Also, maybe try taking baths instead of showers, the shower pressure can be harsh. Finally, you can use less water (and air dry faster) by just getting a wash cloth and wiping down without standing in/sitting the shower or bath.",

It kind of just does its thing…slowly fixing things here and there and generally keeping your skin happy. But, if you took it out of your routine…things would most likely fall apart LOL! That was the Krave Beauty Great Barrier Relief for me.\n\nI feel like the Oat So Simple Water Cream was kind of lacking in a lot of ways while this serum covers so many bases. The Great Barrier Relief is targeted at helping to repair/support the skin’s natural lipid layer while also providing some brightening and skin tone balancing effects. Featured ingredients include Tamanu Oil, Safflower Oil, Niacinamide, Rosehip Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Squalane, Ceramide, and Lactic Acid. \n\nI have tried a number of serums (although I am still a skincare newbie) but I have to say this one really leans more on the side of an actual moisturizer. I’ll mention the Oat So Simple Water Cream again (LOL) by saying it is actually LESS of a moisturizer than the Great Barrier Relief in my opinion.\n\nThe rather heavy consistency of this serum left me a bit worried…my combination skin can sometimes disagree with heavier creams/lotions. But, not only did I avoid any breakouts/congestion from using this product…the finish it leaves behind is really quite mild considering the high concentration of oils. It certainly leaves my skin glowy with a slight shine, but I personally don’t find it to be greasy in any way. The formulation here seems to be really nice.\n\nWhen I started using the Great Barrier Relief…I had just finished up with a brand review using (nearly) all Mad Hippie products. Things didn’t go so well and my skin was feeling quite dry/abused LOL! It only took a few uses of this serum before things started calming back down and my skin regained some of that “bounce” and glow. It wasn’t super “in your face” necessarily…just a feeling of…well…relief to my skin! \n\nOver time my skin feels like it has become a bit more resilient against the irritation that can sometimes happen after chemical/physical exfoliation. So much so that I have been able to add an extra day of AHA/BHA exfoliation to help fight hyperpigmentation which has been really nice.\n\nOkay, praise over LOL…there are a couple of things here that might make some people decide to pass on this product. First off, I personally didn’t see much in the way of brightening/dark spot reduction as a result of using the Great Barrier Relief. I just don’t think the levels of Niacinamide are high enough to have a brightening/pore refining effect. In addition…my skin doesn’t seem phased by/respond to Tamanu Oil. I have used this ingredient in its pure form before without much more than a smelly face.\n\nWhich brings me to the last thing I want to mention…the scent. Tamanu Oil has a very…umm…unique scent. I don’t know how to describe it other than a nutty/earthy Play-Doh scent LOL! This serum is not nearly as intense as straight Tamanu Oil…but I could see some people not getting along with/bailing on this product early on due to the scent. I wish I could say it dissipates quickly but for me it tends to linger. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b742nu394ht41.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6c84a92b96a9d9c8030e5463d27838b2f47fdae4\n\nI think that those who are looking for a serum (or maybe even a light moisturizer/facial oil) that will help to repair and nourish the skin will really enjoy this product. Especially for Oily/Combination skin types that cant handle super heavy or oil-laden moisturizers…the Great Barrier Relief manages to incorporate some really nice emollient ingredients in a formula that is comfortable and not overwhelming. But, if you are looking for a mainly brightening serum…this might not be the perfect fit.\n\nMy stash is PACKED with serums right now so I don’t think this will be an immediate repurchase. But, I think I will hold onto what I have left and come back to it if my skin becomes compromised at some point in the future. If I ever decide to put together a list of “emergency/first aid” skincare favorites (LOL)…Great Barrier Relief is totally on the list!\n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nWater, Propanediol, Calophyllum Inophyllum Seed Oil(10%), Dipropylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Olivate, Polysorbate 60, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Glyceryl Oleate, Sorbitan Olivate, Sorbitan Oleate, Octyldodecanol, Glycerin, Butylene glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Squalane, Serine, Acetyl Glutamine, Glycine, Ceramide NP, Oleic acid, Sodium PCA, Glycosyl trehalose, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterols, Saccharide Isomerate, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Flour, Disodium Phosphate, Sodium Phosphate, Tocopheryl acetate, Coco-caprylate/Caprate, Lactic acid, Xanthan gum, Urea, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Hydrogenated Olive Oil Unsaponifiables, Magnesium Chloride, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glyceryl Caprylate, Pentylene glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA\n\nWhere To Buy (Krave Beauty Site $28.00 USD): [https://kravebeauty.com/collections/shop-all/products/great-barrier-relief](https://kravebeauty.com/collections/shop-all/products/great-barrier-relief)",

    "body": "DIY Nitrosomonas Deodorant\n\nI've been using AO+ Biome mist (containing Nitrosomonas Eutropha) from Mother Dirt for 6 years.  I also use their biome-friendly soap and shampoo.  Alas, their consumer products are no longer made and my stash of all the above items is running out.  So, I've been mixing up my own shampoo, body wash, and now, a replacement for the Nitrosomonas Eutropha-driven AO+ Mist deodorant.\n\nStarting with the idea of using API Quick Start (a Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter solution used to reduce ammonia in aquariums) from another thread in this subreddit, I referred to the AO Mist patent to guesstimate  a recipe for my version of the spray mist.\n\nFirst, I created a buffer solution to carry the bacteria from the API quick start.  The buffer solution uses distilled water, disodium phosphate and magnesium chloride.  The Whitlock AO mist patent specifies the ratio of disodium phosphate to magnesium chloride by milli-mols, but not the concentration of those in solution as far as I could see.   What I ended up trying was a solution of 600 grams distilled water, 3.5 grams disodium phosphate, and 0.1 grams of magnesium chloride.  The phosphate needs to be added slowly to the water to allow it to dissolve thoroughly as you stir.   I then filled 90 ml glass spray bottles with approx 85ml of this buffer solution.   The pH was measured using paper test strips.  The distilled water measured pH of 6.  The buffer solution measured pH of \\~8, which is the same as I measure the AO+ Mist.\n\nThen the final step is to add the API Quick Start containing the two species of ammonia-oxidating-bacteria (AOB) to each spray bottle.    The API Quick Start instructions specify 1ml of API Quick Start to 3,785 ml (1 gallon) of water.  I used a  higher concentration:  1 ml of API Quick Start to 85 ml of the buffer solution.  So this is about 44 times the concentration used in an aquarium, but still modest in the overall concentration.    The little API Quick Start bottle allows you to dispense by drop.  I found 15 drops equalled about 1 gram (\\~1ml).\n\nSo far so good.  I have applied my DIY version of the mist  to my underarms and 1 day in, it seems to be working the same as the AO+ mist.  Meaning, it seems to control odor well.   No side affects so far. I will update as I get further into the experiment.",

        "body": "So far, this AOB mist based on API Quick Start is working very well for me.  I added a little more Quick Start to my recipe in the original post.   I added 10 more drops, or about 2/3 of a ml.  So total Qucck Start added to 85 ml of buffer solution was about 1.65 to 1.7 ml.    This has been working better for me than the original Mother Dirt AO Mist.",

What ChatGP generated seems to jibe with the OP's post.\n\n**DIY Nitrosomonas Deodorant Recipe**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Distilled water - 600 grams\n* Disodium phosphate - 3.5 grams\n* Magnesium chloride - 0.1 grams\n* API Quick Start (ammonia-oxidizing-bacteria solution) - As needed\n\n**Equipment/Materials:**\n\n* Mixing bowl\n* Stirring utensil\n* Measuring scale\n* 90 ml glass spray bottles\n* pH test strips\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Measure 600 grams of distilled water using a measuring scale and pour it into a mixing bowl.\n2. Slowly add 3.5 grams of disodium phosphate to the water while stirring continuously to ensure thorough dissolution.\n3. Add 0.1 grams of magnesium chloride to the mixture and continue stirring until fully dissolved.\n4. Measure the pH of the buffer solution using pH test strips. Ensure that the pH is around 8, similar to the AO+ Mist.\n5. Fill 90 ml glass spray bottles with approximately 85 ml of the prepared buffer solution.\n6. Open the API Quick Start bottle and dispense 1 ml of the solution (ammonia-oxidizing-bacteria) into the 85 ml buffer solution in each spray bottle.\n7. Shake the spray bottles gently to mix the solution.\n8. Measure the pH of the final mixture to confirm it matches the desired pH level.\n9. Apply the DIY Nitrosomonas Deodorant mist to your underarms or desired areas.\n10. Monitor and assess the effectiveness over time. Update the results as needed.\n\nNote: The concentration used is approximately 44 times higher than the one recommended for aquariums, but it's still considered modest. Adjust concentrations if needed based on personal preferences and reactions.",

        "body": "TLDR: I tip the bought mixture into the bottle cap and apply directly to my armpits. It's been 3 weeks and the wife agrees that it's working.\n\nI'm 3 weeks into my very lazy version and thought I'd share my rationale/experience. I was Inspired by this thread, thank you very much for giving me the confidence to try it out.\n\nRationale:\n\n1. The bacteria simply needs to be applied to the skin.\n2. The bottle is presumably already in a buffered/nearly shelf stable solution.\n3. I just needs to be applied sparingly.\n\nI bought 'Seachem Stability 100ml' ( [https://www.pet.co.nz/products/seachem-stability-condition-variant-153415000108](https://www.pet.co.nz/products/seachem-stability-condition-variant-153415000108) ), for $23 NZD including shipping, to test as a few of the fish tank threads said that Seachem brand was always better quality than API (although API products tended to smell better). I picked Seachem as I'm buying it for the bacteria and reckoned any fragrance from the product would be insignificant.\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Rinse body in shower.\n2. Towel dry.\n3. Half fill bottle cap with 'Seachem Stability' solution, 5-10 ml (straight out the bottle)\n4. Hold the cap against the armpit to enclose the solution.\n5. Rub around to wet armpit and repeat for other side.\n6. Excess to be put to any other areas that need attention or back in bottle 6a. I can't imagine anything on my skin after a thorough rinse would damage the bacteria when putting excess back but I could be wrong.\n\nI have been doing this twice a day as my showers are a lot shorter now, not having to apply then rinse off soap and other cleaning products. I've used 75 ml in 16 days, but I was definitely more wasteful at the start before I put excess back in the bottle. If I had a larger bottle I likely wouldn't replace the excess just in case I start cultivating other bacteria.\n\nMy wife has said she hasn't smelled any of my B.O. since I've started doing this. I do get a \"warm\" or \"sharp\" smell from my armpit when I get in to sniff them, but if I double check I can't smell it any more. I assume that's what other people have called the 'sweat' smell. It seems to be worse in the morning even when applying just before bed. I think that's because I'm lying on my side with my arms against my body and there's no air flow to the bacteria, so it becomes an anaerobic environment.\n\nI definitely sweat a lot, and I was once pulled aside in a previous job for BO. I'm intending to continue to go through this indefinitely, I do still wash my hands with soap for obvious reasons.",

That was the Krave Beauty Great Barrier Relief for me.\n\nI feel like the Oat So Simple Water Cream was kind of lacking in a lot of ways while this serum covers so many bases. The Great Barrier Relief is targeted at helping to repair/support the skin’s natural lipid layer while also providing some brightening and skin tone balancing effects. Featured ingredients include Tamanu Oil, Safflower Oil, Niacinamide, Rosehip Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Squalane, Ceramide, and Lactic Acid. \n\nI have tried a number of serums (although I am still a skincare newbie) but I have to say this one really leans more on the side of an actual moisturizer. I’ll mention the Oat So Simple Water Cream again (LOL) by saying it is actually LESS of a moisturizer than the Great Barrier Relief in my opinion.\n\nThe rather heavy consistency of this serum left me a bit worried…my combination skin can sometimes disagree with heavier creams/lotions. But, not only did I avoid any breakouts/congestion from using this product…the finish it leaves behind is really quite mild considering the high concentration of oils. It certainly leaves my skin glowy with a slight shine, but I personally don’t find it to be greasy in any way. The formulation here seems to be really nice.\n\nWhen I started using the Great Barrier Relief…I had just finished up with a brand review using (nearly) all Mad Hippie products. Things didn’t go so well and my skin was feeling quite dry/abused LOL! It only took a few uses of this serum before things started calming back down and my skin regained some of that “bounce” and glow. It wasn’t super “in your face” necessarily…just a feeling of…well…relief to my skin! \n\nOver time my skin feels like it has become a bit more resilient against the irritation that can sometimes happen after chemical/physical exfoliation. So much so that I have been able to add an extra day of AHA/BHA exfoliation to help fight hyperpigmentation which has been really nice.\n\nOkay, praise over LOL…there are a couple of things here that might make some people decide to pass on this product. First off, I personally didn’t see much in the way of brightening/dark spot reduction as a result of using the Great Barrier Relief. I just don’t think the levels of Niacinamide are high enough to have a brightening/pore refining effect. In addition…my skin doesn’t seem phased by/respond to Tamanu Oil. I have used this ingredient in its pure form before without much more than a smelly face.\n\nWhich brings me to the last thing I want to mention…the scent. Tamanu Oil has a very…umm…unique scent. I don’t know how to describe it other than a nutty/earthy Play-Doh scent LOL! This serum is not nearly as intense as straight Tamanu Oil…but I could see some people not getting along with/bailing on this product early on due to the scent. I wish I could say it dissipates quickly but for me it tends to linger. \n\nI think that those who are looking for a serum (or maybe even a light moisturizer/facial oil) that will help to repair and nourish the skin will really enjoy this product. Especially for Oily/Combination skin types that cant handle super heavy or oil-laden moisturizers…the Great Barrier Relief manages to incorporate some really nice emollient ingredients in a formula that is comfortable and not overwhelming. But, if you are looking for a mainly brightening serum…this might not be the perfect fit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l054ntky3ht41.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb07f35f2c4fa61f49a969df1ef1439051d391b6\n\nMy stash is PACKED with serums right now so I don’t think this will be an immediate repurchase. But, I think I will hold onto what I have left and come back to it if my skin becomes compromised at some point in the future. If I ever decide to put together a list of “emergency/first aid” skincare favorites (LOL)…Great Barrier Relief is totally on the list!\n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nWater, Propanediol, Calophyllum Inophyllum Seed Oil(10%), Dipropylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Olivate, Polysorbate 60, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Glyceryl Oleate, Sorbitan Olivate, Sorbitan Oleate, Octyldodecanol, Glycerin, Butylene glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Squalane, Serine, Acetyl Glutamine, Glycine, Ceramide NP, Oleic acid, Sodium PCA, Glycosyl trehalose, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterols, Saccharide Isomerate, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Flour, Disodium Phosphate, Sodium Phosphate, Tocopheryl acetate, Coco-caprylate/Caprate, Lactic acid, Xanthan gum, Urea, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Hydrogenated Olive Oil Unsaponifiables, Magnesium Chloride, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glyceryl Caprylate, Pentylene glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA\n\nWhere To Buy (Krave Beauty Site $28.00 USD): [https://kravebeauty.com/collections/shop-all/products/great-barrier-relief](https://kravebeauty.com/collections/shop-all/products/great-barrier-relief)",

    "body": "**Hi everyone!** Back again with another Structure-Activity Relationship post. You can read the first one about beta blockers (antihypertensives)[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/OrganicChemistry/comments/t37a1a/9_min_read_structureactivity_relationship_how/). Today we will be going through antiepileptics = antiseizure = anticonvulsants. Of course, if you have another drug class to go through, let me know!\n\n# What is Epilepsy?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kaslbxb90vk81.png?width=501&format=png&auto=webp&s=e93106b8bc22f81139da900a1dc4bd3fe6b1dc0a\n\nHippocrates was the first to describe epilepsy as a disease of the body rather than a supernatural take-over by demons (*One the Sacred Disease*, \\~400 BC). He described these devastating diseases as a disease of the brain and wiped away much of the cure magic associated with treating epilepsy. He was able to classify true epilepsy (idiopathic or unknown cause) and symptomatic (organic) epilepsy (e.g. brain injury, tumor, infection, etc.).\n\nSince Hippocrates, the battle to classify and control seizures is an ever going battle. So what is a seizure? A seizure is the abnormal 'firing' of neurons in a region of the brain. This excess electrical stimulation can trigger other neurons to fire wildly cascading in a whole region of the brain misfiring together. There are many types of seizures but they broadly fall into three classes:\n\n1. **Partial Seizures** (Local, Focal) are seizures that originate in one area of the brain. They can progress to general seizures or can remain in that single place. In partial seizures, neuronal discharge originates from that one specific location called the focus.Partial seizures may or may not look convulsive. Simple partial seizures have the potential to not impair the individual but most often patients will have several symptoms: fear, hallucinations, flushing and sweating, unpleasant smell or tastes. Likewise, motor symptoms like jerking of one hand or repeated twitches in an area of the body are common.\n2. **Generalized Seizures** (Tonic-Clonic or Grand Mal) are seizures that encompass a much larger portion of the brain. They are your stereotypical fall down, twitch on the ground seizures. These seizures can be massively impairing to patients. Many states do not let epileptics drive because of the possibility of crashes.\n3. **Myoclonic Seizures** are a third class of seizures characterized by sudden and brief jerks of one muscle or a group of muscles. They are the 'less serious' seizures as they dont last as long as Tonic Clonic seizures BUT can quickly develop into them.\n\nIt should be noted that this is a very simple overview of seizures. If you are interested to know more about seizures, I recommend reading about them here: epilepsy.com Seizures are a serious medical condition and require treatment.\n\n# Treatment with AEDs\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Generally overview of Seizures](https://preview.redd.it/jq5wlrdb0vk81.png?width=627&format=png&auto=webp&s=48afe526721d0d820e8d36bfb7c8d665d241bbad)\n\nBroadly, the treatment of seizures is to inhibit the misfiring of neurons. When neurons are stimulated, they generate an action potential, discharge an electrical signal, and then rest. In epilepsy, the neurons are so stimulated that they don't rest and so continue to fire. This continuous firing causes waves of sustained stimulation at the next neuron which ultimately results in a seizure.\n\n* So what stimulates a neuron? Along the neuron are a number of ion channels that open to change in the internal state of the neuron. When the ion channels are open, they can propagate (continue) the action potential along the axis of the neuron until it reaches the nerve terminal. At the terminus, the nerve is able to communicate with the next nerve and so on. So having ion channels is essential for one nerve to talk to another\n   * In epilepsy, these ion channels can stay open allowing for more action potentials to be generated and so more stimulation. More stimulation = more action potentials = more stimulation of the next neuron = inc likelihood of a seizure\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oxy9lgrc0vk81.png?width=426&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f9a4ec9e2606a999adda83eb69fca19f4c960d6\n\nOne thing I will note about these drugs is that they **do not cure epilepsy**. Many people think the goal of epilepsy treatment is to have 0 seizures, and while that is the hope, it's not practical. These drugs have boat loads of side effects: from simple nausea & vomiting, to migraines and weight gain, to rashes/ulcers or organ damage. **To treat epilepsy, you have to balance seizure control with side effects,** the more you eliminate the seizures by giving larger doses of drug, the more side effects you give the patient. Likewise, cost is a huge aspect of treatment, especially in pharmacy. Can someone afford $53 for their monthly Gabapentin? Do you want to risk them missing a dose to stretch the cost of their drug? Just some food for thought.\n\n# How Anticonvulsants Work\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[An Overview of AntiEpileptic Drugs \\(AEDs\\)](https://preview.redd.it/0akra4lg1vk81.png?width=384&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7b4dff06e6005a304b460db91837f8dea752684)\n\nAs you can see, there are MANY drugs and MANY sites of action. Likewise, drugs can have multiple areas that they can agonize OR antagonize. Today. We will not be focusing on what channels or sites of action of the drugs (that's pharmacology), instead we will be looking at how changes in the chemistry causes better or worse seizure control. **Without further ado, let's dive in!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Ureide structure vs AMPA and Kainate](https://preview.redd.it/juxhh19f0vk81.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=202b5da7a59261cf6822818d666536d141069d27)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Many anticonvulsants have the Ureide backbone or mimic its structure. Remember that for a drug to have an effect, it must take advantage of something that is already happening in the body. The Ureide backbone mimics the endogenous ligands of AMPA and Kainate (KA). These two chemicals (along with NMDA) are all stimulatory molecules that help activate glutamate receptors in the brain. **AMPA, Kainate → stimulatory molecules → if in excess cause too much stimulation → seizure.** Thus, if you can fit into the lock but prevent it turning then you won't have any seizures.\n   * **If you can inhibit the release or action of these endogenous molecules, then you can prevent a seizure!** Many of the Ureide drugs have been used for more than 30 years\n* What's interesting is that very basic changes in the X substituent in the Ureide backbone can cause MASSIVE changes in potency, side effects, and efficacy.\n\n# The First AED Treatments\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A collection of Barbiturates](https://preview.redd.it/3gugt0oh0vk81.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=164bfbfaf514565f441ea4989209155f31659abb)\n\nA collection of Barbiturates\n\n* The first treatment of epilepsy using targeted drug therapy was with Locock's Potassium Bromide in 1857. It wasn't until 1912 that neurologist Dr. Aldred Hauptmann used **phenobarbital** (a sedative) in an epileptic patient and found that it had an amazing ability to control seizures. When you think of it, it kind of makes sense: a sedative depresses brain activity which is what we want in epilepsy, dec brain activity.\n   * The usefulness of bromide and phenobarbital was discovered by chance but following the discovery of phenobarbital's structure, there was a race to develop better and newer drugs.\n   * Following the success of phenobarbital, many other barbiturates were created with the Barbituric Acid backbone. Now, these other barbiturates were created with sedation in mind (for sleep → like how Mariyln Monroe died) but are still extremely useful in seizures.In fact, phenobarbital is the drug of choice for seizures in infants up to 2 months of age. In adults it has lower efficacy than other agents we will see later.\n* You'll notice that the di-substitution at C5 is really what makes barbiturates different. The type of substituent changes the **duration of action** of the drugs which makes them short acting or long acting. The duration is based on how easy it is for the body to metabolize (deactivate) the drug and remove it from the body. In general there are two trends:\n   * &#x200B;\n\n1. **Aliphatic Hydroxylation** \\- metabolizing alkyl **chains.** This is done by adding an OH to the chain turning it from a hydrophilic non-polar region to a hydrophilic polar region. Thus deactivating it!\n\n* 2) **Aromatic Hydroxylation** \\- metabolizing **aryl** rings. This is done by adding an OH to the ring turning it from a hydrophilic non-polar region to a hydrophilic polar region. Thus deactivating it!\n   * While having the aromatic ring may seem larger and cause it to fall under the above rule, aromatic centers generally resist reacting due to stability. The overall resonance of the structure stabilizes the substituent preventing reaction. So, **the presence of an aromatic functional group resists hydroxylation which means a longer acting drug.**\n   * Phenobarbital's duration of action is about 15 hours\n* So what about thiopental? Will it be long acting due to the smaller side chain? Drum roll please........ its ultra-short acting (3 hours)! What? Why?\n   * The reason has nothing to do with chemistry and everything to do with biology (damn you biology! Always ruining our rules). Although metabolism rate is a big factor in duration of action, the ability for the drug to penetrate tissues is another huge factor. Most other **barbiturates are able to be stored in the fat** (high lipophilicity) and so hide from being metabolized. Thiopental however has low fat tissue penetration and so cannot hide. Can't hide → faster metabolism.\n\n# Hydantoins - less sedation with seizure control\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A collection of Hydantoins](https://preview.redd.it/f85995mj0vk81.png?width=847&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5f0058d3f3f3c0606e96477e713c05589275c19)\n\nFollowing the surprise success of phenobarbital, drug companies now used their chemists to purposefully synthesize drugs that would be effective in seizures but try to reduce their sedation. **Phenytoin** (1937) was the first attempt at that!\n\n* Phenytoin is classified as a hydantoin, a five-member ring with two nitrogens in the ureide configuration. In terms of its pharmacology, phenytoin works very similarly to phenobarbital except that it has zero effectiveness on the GABA-a receptor (the one that causes sedation).\n* While phenytoin has great seizure control potential, it’s chemistry is whacked:\n   * Phenytoin may initially appear to be a basic drug. The two nitrogens in the hydantoin backbone would suggest protonation in the presence of acid. Surprisingly, phenytoin’s charge doesn’t form on the nitrogen, it forms on the *oxygen*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Phenytoin Sodium](https://preview.redd.it/v0dwgfll0vk81.png?width=250&format=png&auto=webp&s=6da24cf1dc076b9ac7818feef50b70b67d1b2a44)\n\n* Hydantoins have the ability to tautomerize leading to an acidic oxygen almost instantly deprotonating. This ion forms a salt with sodium readily in the blood. The issue with the phenytoin sodium salt is that phenytoin naturally has a low solubility. When the pH falls below 11-12, the drug crystallizes in solution.\n* So, its 1956 and you have a patient in the middle of an epilepsy emergency (status epilepticus) and you need to give them something. You go for the phenytoin because its the best agent to give the patient and you inject it intravenously because 1) the patient is having a seizure they can't swallow a tablet right now and 2) you need to stop the seizures quickly. What happens? Well…. it **HURTS.** Lets back up.In the blood, there is carbon dioxide dissolved in the blood in the form of bicarbonate. Phenytoin has a special property where it can trap the CO2 when administered quickly. This means that the pH of the phenytoin solution drops below the 11-12 threshold and causes it to crystallize in sharp crystals. These crystals can puncture and hurt the surrounding tissues causing a good amount of pain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Phenytoin Crystals](https://preview.redd.it/jpfsakwm0vk81.png?width=501&format=png&auto=webp&s=dac9b530c73067139ef82d633d5dee69fac7ba75)\n\n* So what can you do? Well first make sure that you prepare the phenytoin solution above pH >11. Likewise, carefully controlling the drug concentration, diluents, and temperature can help prevent rapid crystallization.\n* So do we still use phenytoin in an acute setting even if it causes pain? Yes! Well… not really. We use a different formulation called **fosphenytoin** (1996)**.** Fosphenytoin’s usage of a disodium phosphate ester increases the solubility of the drug over 3x (32 mg/L vs. 142 mg/L). This means that fosphenytoin is freely soluble in the aqueous solution and is safer in a IV or intramuscular injection.\n\n# Finding the Cure - Absence Seizures\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Oxazolidinediones vs Succinimides](https://preview.redd.it/6nw5d1wn0vk81.png?width=375&format=png&auto=webp&s=6518a63e08e03aee2b0aceb527c3da5e7b75e07e)\n\nBy the mid 1940s, phenytoin had a decade of efficacy behind it. Despite serious adverse reactions, phenytoin was effective and could be tolerated by slow infusion to avoid crystallization. There was one issue, phenytoin had no effect on Absence (Petit Mal) seizures; a type of seizure that affects kids 4-9 years old. With no help from phenytoin or other AEDs 6-8% of children (\\~5 million) would develop absence seizures and die with almost no warning.\n\nNever one to waste a tragedy, drug companies poured millions into develop a treatment for absence seizures that would have some positive effect. In 1946, the FDA rapidly approved of **Trimethadione** for the treatment of absence seizures.\n\n* Trimethadione, a type of Oxazolidinedione (say that 5x fast) was the perfect fit. It was metabolized immediately to dimethadione (active metabolite) where it rapidly controlled absence seizures. It is rapidly absorbed and has a half life of 16-24 hours meaning once daily dosing was needed. An all around perfect drug. So… what's wrong with it? Two things:\n   * &#x200B;\n\n1. It completely removed the immune system in kids. Decreased white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets meant that not only were getting sick but they were bleeding and wouldn’t stop bleeding. Likewise it induced suicidal behavior at almost double the rate as placebo. Not to mention day blindness and morbilliform eruption (rash). So you end up with a sick blind rashy 5yo who wants to kill themselves. **Not. Great.**\n\n* 2) While kids are most likely to have absence seizures, a good number of adults do have them too. And with adults comes pregnancy. And with pregnancy comes Fetal Trimethadione Syndrome, a fetal abnormality that causes craniofacial abnormalities. (I will note that fetal abnormalities is a danger is all AEDs but this was the first drug that showed it historically).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fetal Trimethadione Syndrome](https://preview.redd.it/p1w6w8zo0vk81.png?width=230&format=png&auto=webp&s=c88dba5169dec581086686e25f13ce1a2579bc88)\n\nFollowing the introduction of Trimethadione and the rapid withdrawal of a similar drug Paramethadione in 1949, it seemed like we were back to square one. Luckily, **Ethosuximide** (1951) and **Phensuximide** (1953), and **Methsuximide** (1957) were introduced to fill the gap. These drugs, part of a class called succinimides, were accomplished by substituting the ring O with a methylene group. Class wide, these drugs cover more types of absence seizures than their predecessors.\n\n* Ethosuximide is the drug of choice for absence seizures. It is considered the be the least toxic of the succinimides and shows great efficacy. While it does have its issues with psychiatric or immune related changes, it is definitely safer and generally more tolerated than the Oxazolidinediones.\n* Methsuximide and Phensuximide are not as widely used as Ethosuximide but show similar efficacy. This is pretty common: first to the party, first to win.\n\n**And thats the story!** I hope you enjoyed learning about antiepileptic drugs and could see the connection between these drugs. If you have any suggestions of the next drug class let me know! We didn't touch the newer anticonvulsants at all so if people are interested, im down to do them.",

        "body": "Ok here is the recipe from Delicious Memories: Recipes and Stories from the Chef Boyardee Family by Anna Boiardi and Stephanie Lyness. I had found 2 recipes for your request.   \nMeatballs:  \n1.33 lbs ground (93% lean) turkey, 1/2 vidalia onion grated, 1 cup finely grated parmesan cheese, 2 tbsps finely grated pecorino cheese, 2 tbsps chopped fresh parsley, 5 large basil leaves chopped, 3/4 cup breadcrumbs, 2 tbsps ketchup, few drops worcestershire sauce, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp salt, 1 large egg beaten, 1/4 to 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil\n\nMeanwhile, make the meatballs. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Line another baking sheet or large plate with paper towels. Put the ground turkey in a large mixing bowl and gently pull it apart with a fork. Add the grated onion, Parmesan, pecorino, chopped herbs, bread crumbs, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic powder, and work gently with the fork to mix the ingredients thoroughly. Gently mix in the salt, and then the beaten egg. Using your hands, roll the mixture into balls a little smaller than a golf ball, and place them on the foil-lined baking sheet. Heat ¼ cup of the olive oil over medium heat in a large nonstick skillet. Add as many meatballs as will fit comfortably in the pan and cook, turning, until nicely browned, about 6 minutes. Drain them on the paper-towel-lined plate. Add more meatballs to the skillet, and a little oil if the pan is dry, and cook them in the same way. Continue until all the meatballs are cooked and draining. Gently add the meatballs to the saucepan with the sauce. Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer and cook 20 minutes longer.\n\n* Note: you can substitute ground turkey for beef.\n\nTHE TWIST My mom adapted this recipe from her mother-in-law’s meatballs. She substituted ground turkey for ground chuck because my brother and I didn’t like beef (I still don’t care much for red meat). And I’m sure the ketchup was her inspiration, used in place of the more usual tomato paste. That ketchup may account for why my brother and I loved these so much and why my little niece and nephew are happy to help my mom make them when they come over for dinner. Grating the onion is easier than chopping, and it guarantees no discernible chunks of onion in the meatballs.\n\n\\++++++\n\nUncle Hector's tomato sauce:\n\n1-32 oz can peeled plum tomatoes, preferably San Marzano or imported Italian, 6 tbsps extra virgin olive oil - as needed for serving, 1 onion chopped, salt and freshly ground black pepper, 5 medium fresh basil  leaves - cut into strips, \n\nTO MAKE THE SAUCE, set a food mill over a large bowl. Dump the whole can of tomatoes, with their juices, into the food mill and work the tomatoes though until all that’s left in the mill is a handful of dryish tomato pulp and seeds. Discard the pulp and seeds. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over low heat. Add the chopped onion and 1 teaspoon salt and cook slowly, stirring every now and then, until the onion is soft and translucent but not brown, 8 to 10 minutes. (Don’t let the onion brown, or it may turn the sauce bitter.) Add some pepper and the pureed tomato. Bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat so that the sauce simmers gently. Set the timer for 40 minutes and let the sauce cook, the lid partly ajar, to blend the flavors and thicken. When the timer goes off, add the basil and cook 5 more minutes.",

It's described as a hydrating, ultra light suncream for the face. According to ACO, it contains hyaluronic acid, protects against UVA and UVB, it's invisible on the skin, mattifying and dry touch, water and sweat resistent, and suitable for sensitive skin. 40 ml currently costs about 190 SEK / £15.40 / €18.37. It's available in Sweden, and I'd assume in most of Scandinavia. \n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n> Aqua, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Dibutyl Adipate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Tris-Biphenyl Triazine (nano), Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Propanediol, Silica, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, \"1,2-Hexanediol\", Tocopheryl Acetate, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Cetyl Alcohol, Bis-Ethylhexyl Hydroxydimethoxy Benzylmalonate, Sarcosine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Decyl Glucoside, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer, Citric Acid, Disodium Phosphate, Sodium Benzoate \n\n**My experiences:**\n\nI've worn this a couple of times and I can definitely tell it's by ACO. The consistently reminds me of their other products, though this is more liquid and similar to the Eucerin Sensitive Sun Fluid SPF 50+. It's unscented (excellent) and feels gentle on the skin. I don't experience any itching or stickiness, once it's dried down, which takes about 5-10 minutes. It's not shiny, but I'd say it's dewy until it's dried down. I'd also say it's decently sweatproof as I haven't noticed it pearling around my lips, which many sunscreens do because I sweat a lot and easily.\n\nI learned quickly to take the lid off, put my finger over the spout tip and *then* shake it. If you shake it with the lid on, it will dribble sunscreen on you when you unscrew the cap. Putting it on can be a little sticky; it's a very runny product, but it feels tacky against my skin at first and creates a fair bit of friction as you put it on. I often feel like I'm working in a much thicker product than what I have on my hands. I have rosacea and normal-to-dry skin. This doesn't make my rosacea flair, but it does create a white cast along any dry spots or healing acne, and if I don't work it in thoroughly for a bit more time than feels necessary.\n\nI'm pale as a ghost, and this is probably the first time I've experienced a white cast. My *summer* shades are MAC NW15 and NARS Sheer Glow in Mont Blanc, which should hopefully tell you how pale I am. In winter, I'd say KVD LockIt 42, Maybeline Dream Urban Cover in 095 fair porcelain and Maybeline FitMe Matte & Poreless in 101 are closer to my shades. To have a sunscreen create a whitecast on me is a feat, is what I'm saying. If you have a deeper skin tone, either be prepared to work this in thoroughly, or use another sunscreen.\n\n**Verdict**\n\n6/10. \n\nNot the worst, but not the best. I'll probably finish off the tube, then return to using EVY Daily Defense Face Mousse SPF 50 for my morning base layer of sunscreen.",

I only notice a slight cast for the first minute, as I am rubbing it in, but that's it. It feels very comfortable for me, like a lightweight cream that's easy to spread (similar to LRP anthelios in texture) and doesn't accentuate any flakes. \n\nIt's dewy to begin, but after about 10/15 minutes, it sets into a satin/natural finish - neither matte nor dewy. I *hate* a tacky finish and to me this doesn't have one at all (once set). I would describe the feeling as soft/moisturised, but not sticky. It's lightweight to the extent that I never consciously think about it on my face (and my hair won't stick to it, etc.), but it's also not like alcohol-heavy sunscreens that feel imperceptible on the skin. \n\nI also do a lot of outdoor swimming in summer and this stuff is pretty good at staying on, and I have never tanned or burned with ACO SPFs (their cosmetic elegance varies, but the ingredients in their chemical SPF 30s/50s are in my experience really great).",

They’ve added a “conceived in the UK” line at the bottom, which is probably not the exact wording I’d personally choose but whatever https://imgur.com/IdlSXzZ\n\n- - -\n\nOld Altruist SPF50 (3% Glycerin)\n\n> Aqua, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Ethylhexyl Stearate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Octocrylene, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Titanium Dioxide (nano), Cetyl Alcohol, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Triscontanyl PVP, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Phenoxyethanol, Alumina, Piroctone Olamine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Panthenol, Aminomethylpropanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Piroctone Olamine, Simethicone, Tris-Biphenyl Triazine (nano), Decyl Glucoside, Diethylhexyl Sodium Sulfosuccinate, Propylene Glycol, Decyl Glucoside, Disodium Phosphate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Xanthan Gum, Butylene Glycol, Silver Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_a2b7396709.html\n\n-\n\n\nNew Altruist SPF50 (website still says 3% Glycerin, so Ethylhexyl Stearate, Octocrylene, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane have increased in concentration)\n\n> Aqua, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Stearate, Octocrylene, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Titanium Dioxide (nano), Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Tris-Biphenyl Triazine (nano), Ethylhexyl Triazone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Aminomethyl Propanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethanol, Alumina, Piroctone Olamine, Titanium Dioxide, Decyl Glucoside, Disodium Phosphate, Simethicone, Diethylhexyl Sodium Sulfosuccinate, Xanthan Gum, Butylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Propylene Glycol, Silver Chloride.\n\nDifferences aren’t huge, but they’ve removed the silicone Cyclopentasiloxane.\n\nhttp://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_b06f448764.html\n\n\nI’ve noticed the old version sitting in my bathroom starting to separate into goo and watery stuff more and more, so maybe they’ll have improved on this?",

The stinging lasts about ten minutes if I don't wash the lotion off and stops immediately if I do wash it off (which I usually do).  Sometimes it doesn't sting at all, though.\n\nOther products that sometimes sting are the Neutrogena Hydro Gel stuff, which stings like death, and Indeed Hydroluron Gel, which stings slightly.

    "body": "Welcome to the complete guide of how to make cocaine. If you do everything right you are going to be king of the world, either in your own world or in the real world. Please read the disclaimer at the end of this text. Now, let's get to action! The basic formula for cocaine starts by purchasing or making tropinine, converting the tropinone into 2-carbomethoxytropinone (also known as methyl-tropan-3-one-2-carboxylate), reducing this to ecgonine, and changing that to cocaine. Succindialdehyde. This can be purchased, too. 23.2 g of succinaldoxime powder in 410 ml of 1 N sulfuric acid and add dropwise with stirring at 0* a solution of 27.6 g of sodium nitrite in 250 ml of water over 3 hours. After the addition, stir and let the mixture rise to room temp for about 2 hours, taking care not to let outside air into the reaction. Stir in 5 g of Ba carbonate and filter. Extract the filtrate with ether and dry, evaporate in vacuo to get the succindialdehyde. This was t aken from JOC, 22, 1390 (1957). To make succinaldoxime, see JOC, 21, 644 (1956). Complete Synthesis of Succindialdehyde. JACS, 68, 1608 (1946). In a 2 liter 3 necked flask equipped with a stirrer, reflux condenser, and an addition funnel, is mixed 1 liter of ethanol, 67 g of freshly distilled pyrrole, and 141 g of hydroxylamine hydrochloride. Heat to reflux until dissolved, add 106 g of anhydrous sodium carbonate in small portions as fast as reaction will allow. Reflux for 24 hours and filter the mixture. Evaporate the filtrate to dryness under vacuo. Take up the residue in the minimum amount of boiling water, decolorize with carbon, filter and allow to recrystallize in refrigerator. Filter to get product and concentrate to get additional crop. Yield of succinaldoxime powder is a little over 40 g, mp is 171-172*. 5.8 g of the above powder is placed in a beaker of 250 ml capacity and 54 ml of 10% sulfuric acid is added. Cool to 0* and add in small portions of 7 g of sodium nitrite (if you add the nitrite too fast, nitrogen dioxide fumes will evolve). After the dioxime is completely dissolved, allow the solution to warm to 20* and effervescence to go to completion. Neutralize the yellow solution to litmus by adding small portions of barium carbonate. Filter off the barium sulfate that precipitates. The filtrate is 90% pure succindialdehyde and is not purified further for the reaction to create tropinone. Do this procedure 3 more times to get the proper amount for the next step, or multiply the amounts given by four and proceed as described above. Take the total amount of succinaldehyde (obtained from 4 of the above syntheses combined) and without further treatment or purification (this had better be 15.5 g of succindialdehyde) put into an Erlenmeyer flask of 4-5 liters capacity. Add 21.6 g of methylamine hydrochloride, 46.7 g of acetonedicarboxylic acid, and enough water to make a total volume of 2 liters. Adjust the pH to 8-10 by slowly adding a saturated solution of disodium phosphate. The condensate of this reaction (allow to set for about 6 days) is extracted with ether, the ethereal solution is dried over sodium sulphate and distilled, the product coming over at 113* at 25 mm of pressure is collected. Upon cooling, 14 g of tropinone crystallizes in the pure state. 2-Carbomethoxytropinone. A mixture of 1.35 g of sodium methoxide (this is sodium in a minimum amount of methanol), 3.5 g of tropinone, 4 ml of dimethylcarbonate and 10 ml of toluene is refluxed for 30 min. Cool to 0* and add 15 ml of water that contains 2.5 g of ammonium chloride. Extract the solution after shaking with with four 50 ml portions of chloroform, dry, evaporate the chloroform in vacuo. Dissolve the oil residue in 100 ml of ether, wash twice with a mixture of 6 ml of saturated potassium carbonate and three ml of 3 N KOH. Dry and evaporate in vacuo to recover the unreacted tropinone. Take up the oil in a solution of aqueous ammonium chloride and extract with chloroform, dry, and evaporate in vacuo to get an oil. The oil is dissolved in hot acetone, cool, and scratch inside of flask with glass rod to precipitate 2-carbomethoxytropinone. Recrystallize 16 g of this product in 30 ml of hot methyl acetate and add 4 ml of cold water and 4 ml of acetone. Put in freezer for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Filter and wash the precipitate with cold methyl acetate to get pure product. Methylecgonine. 0.4 mole of tropinone is suspended in 80 ml of ethanol in a Parr hydrogenation flask (or something that can take 100 psi and not react with the reaction, like stainless steel or glass). 10 g of Raney Nickle is added with good agitation (stirring or shaking) followed by 2-3 ml of 20% NaOH solution. Seal vessel, introduce 50 psi of hydrogen atmosphere (after flushing vessel with hydrogen) and heat to 40-50*. After no more uptake of hydrogen (pressure gauge will hold steady after dropping to its lowest point) bleed off pressure and filter the nickle off, rinse out bottle with chloroform and use this rinse to rinse off the nickle while still on the filter paper. Make the filtrate basic with KOH after cooling to 10*. Extract with chloroform dry, and evaporate the chloroform in vacuo to get an oil. Mix the oil plus any precipitate with an equal volume of dry ether and filter. Add more dry ether to the filtrate until no more precipitate forms, filter and add to the rest of the precipetate. Recrystallize from isopropanol to get pure methylecgonine. Test for activity. If active, skip down to the step for cocaine. If not active, proceed as follows. Stir with activated carbon for 30 min, filter, evaporate in vacuo, dissolve the brown liquid in methanol, and neutralize with 10% HCl acid in dry ether. Evaporate the ether until the two layers disappear, and allow to stand for 2 hours at 0* to precipitate the title product. There are many ways to reduce 2-carbomethoxytropinone to methylecgonine. I chose to design a Raney Nickle reduction because it is cheap and not as suspicious as LAH and it is much easier than zinc or sodium amalgams. Cocaine. 4.15 g of methylecgonine and 5.7 g of benzoic anhydride in 150 ml of dry benzene are gently refluxed for 4 hours taking precaution against H20 (the 2 should be on a lower level) in the air (drying tube). Cool in an ice bath, acidify carefully with hydrochloric acid, dry, and evaporate in a vacuum to get a red oil which is treated with a little portion of isopropanol to precipitate cocaine. As you can see, this is quite a chore. The coca leaves give ecgonine, which as you can see, is only a jump away from cocaine. If you can get egconine, then dissolve 8 1/2 g of it in 100 ml of ethanol and pass (bubble) dry HC1 gas through this solution for 30 min. Let cool to room temp and let stand for another 1 1/2 hours. Gently reflux for 30 min and evaporate in vacuo. Basify the residue oil with NaOH and filter to get 8.4 g of methylecgonine, which is converted to cocaine as in the cocain step above. Below is given a somewhat easier method of producing tropinone by the general methods of Willstatter, who was instrumental in the first synthetic production of cocaine and several other alkaloids. After reviewing this method, I found it to be simpler than the above in many respects. Tropinone. 10 g of pyrrolidinediethyl diacetate are heated with 10 g of cymene and 2 g of sodium powder, the reaction taking place at about 160*. During the reaction (which is complete in about 10 min) the temp should not exceed 172*. The resulting reaction product in dissolved in water, then saturated with potassium carbonate, and the oil, which separates, is boiled with dilute sulfuric acid. 2.9 g of tropinone picrate forms and is filtered. Here are two more formulas devised by Willstatter that produce tropinone from tropine. Take note of the yield differences. Tropinone. To a solution of 25 g tropine, dissolved in 10 times its weight of 20% sulfuric acid are added 25 g of a 4% solution of potassiumpermanganate in 2 or 3 g portions over 45 min while keeping the temp at 10-12*. The addition of permanganate will cause heat (keep the temp 10-12*) and precipitation of manganese dioxide. The reaction mixture is complete in 1 hour. A large excess of NaOH is added and the reaction is steam distilled until 1 liter of distillate has been collected. The tropinone is isolated as the dibenzal compound by mixing the distillate with 40 g of benzaldehyde in 500 cc of alcohol and 40 of 10% sodium hydroxide solution. Let stand several days to get dibenzaltropinone as yellow needles. Yield: 15.5 g, 28%. Recrystallize from ethanol to purify. Tropinone. A solution of 12 g of chromic acid in the same amount of water (12 g) and 60 g of glacial acetic acid is added dropwise with stirring over a period of 4 hours to a solution of 25 g of tropine in 500 cc of glacial acetic acid that has been warmed to 60-70* and is maintained at this temp during the addition. Heat the mixture for a short time on a steam bath until all the chromic acid has disappeared, cool and make strongly alkaline with NaOH. Extract with six 500 cc portions of ether and evaporate the ether in vacuo to get an oil that crystallizes readily. Purify by convering to the picrate or fractionally distill, collecting the fraction at 224-225* at 714 mm vacuo. The tropinones can be used in the above formula (or in a formula that you have found elsewhere) to be converted to cocaine. Remember to recrystallize the 2-carbomethoxytropinone before converting to methylecgonine.\n\n This text is spread for informational purpose only.

    "body": "(http://www.amazon.com/Kose-Sekkisei-Clear-Whitening-2-8oz/dp/B00F2OP8N8)[Link to amazon product]\n\n\nRecently, I was perusing my local drug/beauty store and asked the lady about any peel off masks that would be good for dry/acne prone skin. My acne fluctuates, largely due to CSP, and i wanted something that would lighten up old scars, clear my pores, but was easy on my dry patches of skin and gentle on sensitive skin. This product is suggested towards normal to dry skin, I think. \n\n\nThe lady suggested Sekkisei Clear Whitening Mask. I tried it out as soon as I got home, and let me tell you, this stuff is like miracle glue. I say glue because it is literally like a giant Biore pore strip for your faces. It looks and feels like tar when you put it on, and has to be fairly well spread out due to it's consistency. The directions suggest to leave it on for about 20 minutes, then peel it off, and only use twice a week.\n\n**First Use**\nWhen I used it, I applied it all over, waited the time, and was rearing to start peeling. It would come off like any regular peel of mask, but there would be a  bit more strength behind it, though not agitating or over powering. It actually worked like a pore strip and visibly cleared out my pores. My face was amazingly soft after one use and it had taken away my dry spots ( the flakes came off with the mask). My face looked visibly brighter after just one use. \n\n\n**A word of caution:** THIS HAS ALCOHOL IN IT SO DRY SKIN BE WARY. I highly suggest you don't use this on existing scabs or wounds as it will take off the scab. Also, keep away from hairy places on your face as this stuff will pull on the hair. It doesn't hurt on fine hairs though, just be wary of eyebrow and beside your face. Also, I **highly suggest** you ONLY use it twice a week as I could see how this could be agitating and drying if used every day. \n\n\nI have since used it 3 times and my skin seems to be clearing up and my hyper-pigmentation/scars lightening, though i'm not sure if it will eventually cause a reaction later on, but i doubt it. My skin seems to love it, even despite the alcohol, as long as a properly moisturize after (to which I use Soy Rose water toner, and avocado oil). \n\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (Aqua), Polyvinyl Alcohol, Alcohol, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Bentonite, Ppg-10 Methyl Glucose Ether, Titanium/Titanium Dioxide, Angelica Acutiloba Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Chaenomeles Sinensis Fruit Extract, Coix Lacryma-Jobi Ma-Yuen Seed Extract, Melothria Heterophylla Root Extract, Butylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Diethylhexyl Sodium Sulfosuccinate, Dipropylene Glycol, Disodium Phosphate, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Pentaoleate, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance (Parfum)",

And if it's strong enough to pull out live hairs it sounds too harsh for the skin. And I think that it made your face soft and it cleared your dry spots because it was ripping off your top layer of skin. This isn't a good thing, physical exfoliation is typically too harsh for the face, and chemical methods are usually a safer bet. \n\nJust my thoughts. \nSomeone please correct me if I said anything  wrong!",

I have started following a skincare routine 11 days ago. It was a joyous Thursday for my face that, over the course of past 30 years, has been exposed to the winds, low temperatures, a late onslaught of chicken pox, persistent hormonal acne, and results of a poor diet. I also happen to have PCOS, which makes the challenge to have clear skin extra challenging.\n\nThis is our starting point. After reading through [the Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index) on r/SkincareAddiction, I had come up with the following routine to improve the condition of my skin:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# ROUTINE\n\n**MORNING**\n\n* Cleanser \\(Step I\\): **Bioderma Sensibio H2O micellar water** \\(applied with a cotton pad\\)\n   * *Ingredients:* Water, PEG\\-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Propylene Glycol, Cucumis Sativus \\(Cucumber\\) Fruit Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Disodium EDTA, Cetrimonium Bromide.\n* *Moisturiser \\(Step I\\):* **Lumene Hydration Recovery Oxygenation** **gel** **mask**\n   * *Ingredients:* Water, Propanediol, Betula Alba \\(Birch\\) Juice, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth\\-20, Phenoxyethanol, Rubus Chamaemorus \\(Cloudberry\\) Seed Extract, Acrylates/c10\\-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Peg\\-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Trehalose, Urea, Eriophorum Spissum Flower/Stem Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium Edta, Copper Gluconate, Magnesium Aspartate, Zinc Gluconate, Pentylene Glycol, Serine, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Algin, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium Phosphate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Pullulan, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sorbic Acid, Potassium Phosphate, Linalool, Benzyl Salicylate, Alpha\\-Isomethyl Ionone, Limonene, Citronellol, Parfum \\(Fragrance\\), \\(Ci 42090\\) Blue 1, \\(Ci 60730\\) Ext.

Other concerns include enlarged pores, rosacea in the nose area, closed comedones, and a selection of pimples.\n\nI have come to the conclusion that my face must be as dehydrated as Gobi desert out of rain season, and so my first action was to moisturise, moisturise, moisturise! At the same time, I wanted to include products meant for sensitive skin, to decrease the risk of a breakout or adverse reaction. I also tend to avoid perfumed skincare, and that was another factor when I was picking the jars and bottles.\n\nAny critique of my routine would be most welcome! Do these products work together? Is there something crucial missing? \\(I am planning on incorporating exfoliation and sunscreen next. Also, please, don't panic — I have not seen the sun in months. Years. Or so it feels.\\) Is there something I should stop using? Am I truly a happy victim of clever marketing and a corporate\\-friendly whore? \\(You betcha.\\)\n\nSo far, the result has been a more even \\(texture, not colour\\) skin with smaller pores, but, of course, this is early days.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# QUESTION\n\nA crucial point of my morning routine, and not something normally suggested for beginners, is a mask. I apply it just before I sit down to meditate. It makes sense that, while I imagine 'a steady stream of liquid sunlight' pouring through my body, I am also using that time to take care of my skin. I have found that one action triggers the other and, altogether, that is a very happy combination.\n\nI have been using the Lumene Hydration Recovery mask for the past few days, and I want to hear your suggestions for alternatives. While I did not dislike that mask, I did not feel like it was doing much for me either. Plus, it was a gift from Finland and I am in Britain, and that does not work very easily. Lastly, I would like to try a number of masks \\(and continue to discover new awesome products\\), rather than settle on a single 'meh' option.\n\nCan you help me find the mask\\(s\\)? To sum it up, I'm looking for a mask that...\n\n* Has a 10\\-15 minute application period\n* Comes in a tube or a jar \\(i.e. not a sheet mask\\)\n* Is suitable for frequent use\n* Fits my routine \\(see above\\)\n\nSuggestions of mask combinations \\(alternating masks\\) are also welcome!",

My love for masks makes me always be on the lookout for a new one and I’ve tried many out there. \n\nI’m not really a fan of sheet masks, or I haven’t tried any that has impressed me so I won’t mention those. They feel nice and are relaxing, but that’s about it. \n\nI really love Freeman’s Apple Cider Vinegar Clay mask. You can use it as a cleanser scrub or use it as a mask, I’ve only used it as a mask. I think it can be used about 2-3 times per week, so it can be used to alternate with other masks. What I like: it’s inexpensive, makes my skin feel extra soft and clean, my skin tone looks brighter even after just one use. \n\nI got this face mask kit from [Fresh at Sephora] (https://m.sephora.com/product/picture-perfect-mask-set-P424612?SKUID=1998459&om_mmc=ppc-GG_1165716881_53825939660_pla-420369839425_1998459_257731947998_9007386_m&country_switch=us&lang=en&gclid=CKnR1YzD3toCFYPIswodzf8JcQ&gclsrc=ds) and I absolutely love every mask that comes in it. \n\nThe Umbrian Clay Mask I find really improves the appearance of pores, blackheads/white heads. It feels good and relaxing to have it on. It says to use for up to 5 minutes, but I always start doing stuff and end up using it for longer. I find this mask is nice to use as a “premask” for the Rose or Black Tea mask. I only do this about once a week, when I’m feeling fancy. \n\nThe Rose mask feels like heaven on your skin. It has this nice cooling feeling and I find it to be very hydrating, and it makes my skin look supple and radiant. \n\nThe Black Tea mask says to use 2-3 times per week. It tingles very intensely for the first minute, but after that it feels fine.  I find this mask seems to even the texture of my skin somewhat (I’ve only used it once so far). \n\nI’ve also tried FAB Ginger Turmeric Jelly Mask. I like this one better as I love the cooling jelly on my skin. I find that it gives my skin a nice radiant glow. You can use it up to 3 times per week. I tried FAB’s bouncy mask too (a sample) and I wouldn’t buy it because I didn’t see any difference and it didn’t feel as good as the other masks I love. \n\nClinique Pep Start Bubble Mask. This is a fun mask to use in the morning as you don’t have to leave it on for long. I like the bubbling effect, it makes my skin feel extra clean and revitalized. I’ve only used this 2 times in some samples I got. \n\nBoscia Luminizing black masks. I really love this one as I find it to be very clarifying, and helps with the appearance of pores. I love peeling it off, it’s so fun and i feel like it takes so much with it. \n\nI have a few others in my cabinet that I haven’t tried yet, but I’ll report back when I do.",

No irritation either when I used it with my Vit C serum yesterday. \n\nI've also used the Purito Centella Buffet Serum, which also has niacinamide plus some really calming ingredients. I also liked this one but found the lavender scent a bit much after a few months of use.

    "body": "Anyone who has ever tried to create instant pudding using either almond or soy milk knows that it doesn't work. It tastes delicious but it never \"sets\" or solidifies into a pudding consistency. [Jello](http://www.jello.com/products/sugar-free-desserts/) has about a dozen sugar free flavors with a net 6 or 7 carbs per serving BEFORE you add milk so if someone could figure this out it would be a boon to low carbers.\n\nI searched and found three basic approaches that low carbers have taken to get it to work. The first is using less fake milk (like replacing 2 cups of real milk with only 1 cup of almond milk). Obviously the result will be more solid if you start with less liquid but this means you end up with fewer servings and doubles the carbs per serving. And after experimenting with this I can tell you it still never reaches a real pudding consistency. \n\nThe second approach is adding a thickening agent. I've seen Xanthan gum and Guar gum used. But this stuff is expensive and the final result is slightly slimey.\n\nThe third approach delivers the best consistency. You use some real milk product and cut it with fake milk. I've seen both skim milk and heavy cream used but the former adds carbs and the latter massively increases the calories (and adds an incidental amount of carbs despite what the label says). But at least the result is actually pudding.\n\nSo obviously there is something in instant pudding which when exposed to real dairy turns into a gel. It wasn't hard to \nfind, its right there in the ingredients list \"TETRASODIUM PYROPHOSPHATE AND DISODIUM PHOSPHATE (FOR THICKENING)\". But why do these components thicken when exposed to dairy? What is the mechanism? \n\nIt took more research than I like to admit but I've figured it out. There are 2 primary proteins in milk: whey (making up approximately 20% of milk protein) and casein (making up approximately 80% of milk protein). Whey is well known as the most popular protein powder consumed by bodybuilders the world over. Casein is better known for its use in cheese making. It seems casein coagulates when acidified or when exposed to certain compounds universally found in the stomach's of mammals. Aha!\n\nIs the problem with instant pudding that real dairy contains casein and almond and soy milk don't? The way to test my theory would be to add casein to fake milk and see if the pudding thickens. Luckily although whey protein powder is far and away the better seller, casein protein powder also exists. Bodybuilders like to take it at bedtime because it turns into a gel in their stomach's and slowly makes protein available to the body throughout the night. So I plunked down $30 bucks for a 2 lb tub of unflavored casein powder (which contains no carbs).\n\nThe first time I tried it I could tell in the first 60 seconds that I was on the right track. I stuck it in the fridge and came back in an hour and it had worked. We have achieved pudding! It took a little trial and error but I determined that the correct amount of casein to use is about 7 grams per cup of fake milk. \n\nJust replace the dairy milk cup for cup with either almond or soy milk (or theoretically any liquid; even water). Add 7 grams of unflavored casein powder and \n stir thoroughly making sure that it gets completely dissolved. Then add the instant pudding mix and stir thoroughly again. Then stick it in the fridge and an hour later you have no compromise low carb instant pudding. From my 2 lb tub of casein powder I have enough to make about 90 batches.\n\nYou must be thinking at this point; this guy, this guy really likes pudding. Well now that we know how to do this we can make mousse, no-bake cheesecake and pudding pies! Now we can think of pudding as an ingredient low carbers can use to make all kinds of things. And we can do it with off-the-shelf  flavors like cheesecake, butterscotch, banana cream, lemon, pistachio and chocolate fudge. At only 6 or 7 net carbs per serving (depending on the flavor) you can afford to have dessert again once in a while.\n\ntl;dr Add 7 grams of unflavored casein powder per cup of liquid to get instant pudding to work without real milk",

I really feel like no other product has popped up on my social media feeds more than this item (aside from this summer’s cleansing balm obsession from Glow Recipe). \n\nI ended up taking this product a lot more seriously once I began seeing it pop up in some of my favorite Korean YouTube Channels. So, Green Clean ended up finding its way into my routine over the past month and I’m so happy it did!\n\nFeaturing papaya, moringa, eggplant, and turmeric extracts...this super lightweight and creamy balm just melts into skin and provides the perfect amount of slide/glice to remove makeup and impurities.\n\nSunflower oil makes its way into  the formulation to add some nourishment and softness to the skin after rinsing. And that rinse, it’s awesome. The Farmacy Green Clean emulsifies and rinses better than any other cleansing balm I have used this year...all without making my skin dry/tight. \n\nThe addition of several citrus based essential oils creates a key lime pie/lemon-lime soda scent that I love. And although I haven’t had any negative reaction to them...I certainly proceeded with caution as my skin hasn’t been appreciating these types of fragrant oils recently. \n\nThis really is an awesome cleansing balm and I see why so many people proclaim their love of it. I’m right there with them and this product has easily become a top pick for this year. \n\nPersonally, I’m looking forward to trying the limited edition Very Cherry Clean as it omits the essential oils and has an equally lovely cherry/vanilla scent. \n\nHave you gotten to try the Farmacy Green Clean...what are your thoughts?\n\nFull Ingredients List: Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Peg-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Peg-10 Isostearate, Polyethylene, Echinacea Purpurea Root Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Moringa Pterygosperma Seed Extract, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Glycerin, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Amber Powder, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Water, Butylene Glycol, Disodium Phosphate, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Citral, Limonene, Linalool \n\nWhere To Buy (Sephora - $34.00 USD - 100ml): [https://www.sephora.com/product/green-clean-makeup-meltaway-cleansing-balm-P417238?skuId=1899103&icid2=products%20grid:p417238:product](https://www.sephora.com/product/green-clean-makeup-meltaway-cleansing-balm-P417238?skuId=1899103&icid2=products%20grid:p417238:product) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/52njaem37bv51.jpg?width=5472&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ac44c763ee0c21f51609c9cc21a4692b8c86222",

        "body": "Is this even still available? As far as I was aware, Stemm was discontinued a couple of weeks ago, and the parent company Deciem was selling off their remaining stock at a discounted rate. They’re apparently going to somewhat reformulate the products and bring them back under another brand heading, but idk if they’ve done that yet.\n\nStill, if they have any left and you’re thinking about getting it, here’s my experience so far. I just got the density stimuli like a week ago, after buying it when it became discounted. I use it every night, and the instructions say to use it on a dry scalp, and not to wash it off - so don’t use it directly before or after a shower.\n\nIt’s fairly easy to massage into my head, but it’s definitely a very wet serum, and it takes time to dry, almost an hour if I’ve been liberal with it. The top of my head definitely looks like I’ve just taken a shower after I use it. Its consistency is only slightly thicker than water and it kind of trickles down your head if you don’t immediately massage it in. But at the same time, it’s sticky?! Even after it dries, even in the morning, it feels a bit sticky, which is frustrating if you’ve just washed your hair. But if I brush through the stickiness, it dissipates and my hair looks normal. That’s my biggest complaint about this product - the stickiness makes my hair feel unclean.\n\nIt also has a very natural earthy but medicinal type of smell that doesn’t bother me and that I quite like, but I completely understand if someone else would be bothered by it. The first night I used it, the smell lingered for a while, but on subsequent nights I noticed it less and less, probably because I got used to the scent.\n\nIn terms of effectiveness, this is a serum that’s supposed to increase density of growing, so it needs time to take effect. As I understand it, it probably won’t have much effect on already grown strands of hair. So I need to wait about 3 months before I actually compare before and after. But so far there has been a very strong placebo effect where the morning after, I feel like my scalp is less visible through my hair. Again, probably just a placebo effect, but I like feeling like something is actually working, so that’s why I’ve kept it up.\n\nIn terms of ingredients, I’m most interested in the fact that it has a highly soluble version of caffeine, which has been proven to stimulate hair growth. As for oils, it says in the ingredients list that it has castor oil (which explains the stickiness to me, castor oil is notoriously sticky) so maybe not the best product for you? But also, it’s very low down on the ingredients list, so maybe you can tolerate it??\n\ntbh I’m 50/50 on it so far. I might be more upset if I’d actually paid the original $30+ for it, but since it was about $13 when I bought it, I’m ok with what it’s been doing so far.\n\nHope this helps!",

    "body": " I am a Southeast Asian with sensitive/sensitized skin. I also have fungal acne. And have been breaking due to a suspected reformulation of Dear Klairs' Supple Preparation Unscented Toner. To be clear, I have posted this on r/Fungalacne subreddit but I got no answers, but as the brand is part of Asian Beauty products then might as well ask here. SO here are the details.  \nI scanned the ingredients of the sampler I got from a reseller in Shopee PH. I scanned the ingredients manually (the official website is not complete) using [Sezia.co](https://Sezia.co) and got one positive which is Polysorbate 60. This has caused me breakouts and I continually used this for 3 days. It also caused me to abruptly stop my skincare routine as I didn't know what was wrong until I scanned it last night on April 22, 2022. Please help!\n\nThese are the ingredients listed in my samplers box if the picture is too blurry to read.\n\n Water, Butylene Glycol, Dimethyl Sulfone, Betaine, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Disodium EDTA, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Chlorphenesin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycerin, Arginine, Carbomer, Panthenol, Luffa Cylindrica Fruit/Leaf/Stem Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Althaea Rosea Flower Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Polyquaternium-51, Beta-Glucan, Lysine HCL, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Acetyl Methionine, Theanine, Proline, Natto Gum, Disodium Phosphate, Polysorbate 60, Sodium Phosphate, Copper Tripeptide-1   \n\n\nAs you can see in f.c.'s (the blogger behind [SimpleSkinCareScience.com](https://SimpleSkinCareScience.com)and founding knowledge of r/Fungalacne) link in his written blog of \"1500+ Fungal Acne Safe Products: An Updated List of Skincare For Malassezia\", Dear Klairs Supple Preparation Unscented Toner is in bold and according to the article, it means it is \\[what he thinks\\] one of the best product. Now, I have also gone to the official website of Dear Klairs but I have found a discrepancy between this sampler and their website's listed ingredients. I haven't tried this particular product before but as I checked their official website and a reseller on Shopee there's no difference in ingredients. Tbf, the blog's latest update was on March 2021\n\nLink here: [https://bit.ly/3ECPbNr](https://bit.ly/3ECPbNr) if it doesn't work then here, [https://simpleskincarescience.com/fungal-acne-products-malassezia-pityrosporum-folliculitis/](https://simpleskincarescience.com/fungal-acne-products-malassezia-pityrosporum-folliculitis/)\n\nI have searched google about reformulation but I can't find any. I also authenticated its barcode on [https://www.upcitemdb.com/](https://www.upcitemdb.com/) and it has listed that its country of registration is in South Korea and nothing else (along with Midnight Blue Calming Cream)\n\nP.S. I tried my best to have the best picture quality ;(\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/upijo6p3bgv81.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c90bd61e962b92c9c4cee633d505a239f8c4c64",

        "body": "I know this is a few months old, but THANK YOU for posting this. I bought a full size bottle from Ulta months ago, used it a couple times and was wondering why the HECK it’s so popular because it immediately started breaking me out *and* caused a seb derm (fungal) flare the same day I started using it.   My skin felt super soft and nice right when I put it on, but within a couple hours there was no hydration to be felt (yes I put moisturizer over it/know how to use toners properly lol). \n\nI assumed it was the betaine because every single product I’ve ever tried that has betaine in it has caused me major issues - it’s been the only consistent ingredient across all of the products. I never bothered to check the ingredient list on the box when I first got it, or when it caused problems because I remembered seeing betaine on it when I ordered it (before I bought other products with it and discovered, or assuming, that it’s the issue). \n\nI checked the box of the Klairs toner after reading this post a few days ago and sure enough, Polysorbate 60. Now honestly/to be fair, I don’t know if I’m sensitive to it/if it causes issues for me because I haven’t been using anything else that contains it, or any other polysorbates, over the past 3+ years. But I found your post while doing a general Google search to see if there have been any other people who suspect a betaine sensitivity after I *again* foolishly tried using this toner (for the 4th time spaced out over a few months) to see if maybe I was wrong about it. I’m glad I’m a weirdo and keep all of my product boxes for a long time after purchasing stuff because otherwise I’d never know - Ulta’s website and app still have the WRONG ingredient list posted, and like so many other products, the ingredient list isn’t on the bottle. \n\nI won’t be back home until later today, possibly tomorrow, but I will happily take a picture and share it here. I was in a hurry the other day when I first discovered it and just remembered to come back and comment. I was *super* bummed that I had such a bad, immediate reaction to it because sooo many people swear by it. I wonder how many other people with fungal issues are using this formulation, and if they are having issues!!   \n\nWhile I’m here/at it - anyone else suspect betaine sensitivity?  Especially anyone with fungal issues?  I know it’s an amino acid so the times I’ve used products that have it I’ve made sure not to combine it with anything containing squalane or any other fatty-whatever ingredients that you aren’t supposed to mix with AAs if you have malassezia-related skin issues. (It *is* all amino acids right?  Not just arginine?  That’s what I recall the blog saying - all AAs).\n\nEdit to add - LOL i just looked up my Ulta orders to see the order date was - April 25, 2022… one day before you made this post hahaha!  My bday is 4/24 so it was part of my “happy bday to me” order.",

As an aside: I had a shipping issue, and when I e-mailed the Farmacy customer service, I had a response and solution in 10 minutes. This obviously doesn't make their products *better* but I wanted to shout out to their stellar customer service gals.\n\n* Dew It All eye cream: Nothing much to say here; this was a cart-filler to max out my coupon value. I wear contacts and my eyes get irritated easily, so I'd been in business for an eye cream with minimal irritants. I find mineral oil (and derivatives like aquaphor and vaseline) irritate my eyes at night if I apply them too close, but products with Glycerin are less irritating. What can I say - eye creams don't cause miracles overnight, but this one is hydrating and the hyaluronic acid does visibly juice up fine lines when it's applied. I was worried the fatty alcohols would irritate my skin, but didn't experience any.\n\nINGREDIENTS: Water, Glycerin, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Jojoba Esters, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Patented Echinacea Purpurea ‘Greenenvytm’ Root Extract, Candelilla/ Jojoba/Rice Bran Polyglyceryl-3 Esters, Glyceryl Stearate, Undecane, Adansonia Digitata Seed (Baobab) Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Gluconolactone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Tridecane, Arachidyl Alcohol, Ribose, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Behenyl Alcohol, Strelitzia Nicolai Seed Aril Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Glucoside, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin, Gellan Gum, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Cellulose Gum, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Amino-Esters-1, Calcium Gluconate, Amino Ester-1, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Muricatum Fruit Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Algae Extract, Salicylicacid, Ocimumsanctumleafextract, Tocopherol, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Lawsonia Inermis Extract, Ocimum Basilicum (Basil) Extract, Pearl Powder (Margarita Powder), Sorbic Acid, Lactic Acid, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Glycolate.\n\n\n* Honey Savior all-in-one Salve: This one is my favorite. The texture is liquid but applies like an oil or melting balm. I've been using it on my cuticles and face where I get dry patches (chin, apples of cheeks, between eyebrows). I love the texture, smell, and it's been very nourishing and hydrating used at night. \n\nINGREDIENTS: Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Hydroxystearic/Linolenic/Linoleic Polyglycerides, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Honey Extract, Canola Oil, Propolis Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Rhus Succedanea Fruit Wax, Rhus Verniciflua Peel Wax, Echinacea Purpurea Root Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Wax, Tocopherol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Beeswax, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Honey, Flavor.\n\n* Honey Potion Mask: Honestly thought I'd love this one more than I did. The packaging is gorgeous and it comes with a tiny magnetic spatula to apply product. But I have very sensitive skin and this product has a *very* intense warming sensation when massaged into the skin. I left it on for 5 minutes and had to wash it off because it was stinging. It made my face quite red, and burned my eyes while washing it off. Once the redness subsided, my skin did feel softer, but I think the results were not worth the pain. Masks should feel relaxing and indulgent. This one made me feel panicked. \n\nINGREDIENTS: Glycerin, Diglycerin, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Honey Extract, Propolis Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, Panthenol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Allantoin, Phenoxyethanol, Echinacea Purpurea Root Extract, Honey, Water, Flavor, Vanillyl Butyl Ether\n\n* Green Clean cleansing balm: I hadn't jumped on the oil/balm cleansing train because I don't wear heavy makeup, and always felt like a cleanser+toner was enough to clear my skin. But after trying this guy, I'm definitely going to be adding it as a pre-cleanse step for nights where my face feels greasy or dry. It has a lovely silky texture and a tiny amount gives a thorough cleanse without stripping the skin at all. It does have citrus oils, so I've only been using it at night in case it makes my skin more photosensitive. \n\nINGREDIENTS: Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Peg-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Peg-10 Isostearate, Polyethylene, Phenoxyethanol, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Amino Esters-1, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Amber Powder, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Water/ Aqua/ Eau, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Echinacea Purpurea Root Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Moringa Pterygosperma Seed Extract, Disodium Phosphate, Citric Acid",

However a cultured solution of the same bacteria is available. It's [used for fish tanks](http://www.apifishcare.com/pdf/Quick_Start.pdf)\n\nIs it possible to safely dilute this, put it in a plant mister, and use it on skin? If so, how? My thoughts were to dilute in distilled water  and add epsom salts, and bicarbonate of soda for the PH. But I have no clue what I'm doing and would like some advice (feel free to advise me it's a ridiculous idea.) Also, is nitrobacter winogradski, which is not in the AO+ mist, safe?\n\nHere are the ingredients of the fish tank bacteria, from the document on chemical composition linked above. \n\n*nitrosomonas eutropha <1 %*\n\n*nitrobacter winogradski <1%*\n\n*water >60%*\n\nAnd here are the ingredients of AO+ mist:\n\n*live cultured Nitrosomonas eutropha (Nitrosomonas D23)*\n\n*Disodium phosphate: An inorganic salt, buffering agent, pH adjuster and a key component of the buffer solution that the AOB thrive in.*\n\n*Magnesium chloride: An inorganic salt that is a key component of the buffer solution that the AOB thrive in.* \n\n*Water: Helps dissolve the salts and keeps the AOBs in a sustainable medium for delivery to the skin.*\n\nThanks for any insights you can offer!

Its been bombed because you just had surgery and need to repopulate). From what ive seen online after my (admittedly quick and cursory) research, i wouldnt trust the hype quite yet.

That's why he can charge so much for the product. However point [0143] will give you the information you need to use the bacteria in a cosmetic preparation.\r\n\r\nYou could try other types of N. eutropha as they may help to control certain aspects of skin microbial populations. A rather easy example can be found here: \r\nhttp://scholarspace.jccc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1062&context=honors_journal&sei-redir=1&referer=https%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.ca%2Fscholar%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3Dbacteria%2Bskin%2Bnitrosomonas%26btnG%3D%26as_sdt%3D1%252C5%26as_sdtp%3D#search=%22bacteria%20skin%20nitrosomonas%22\r\n\r\nAs for Nitrobacter winogradskyi, there is no harm in having it on the skin. More about it here: https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Nitrobacter_winogradskyi \r\n\r\nThe big question of course is whether you should you do it. I can't tell you one way or the other. If you really want to try, start with a small section of the body - like say the inner elbow or forearm - then you can find out how you react to it and whether it is safe.

    "body": "(Long read, but please do if you’re knowledgeable about these kinds of things)\n\nSo my experience with Parnate thus far has not been all that great. On Sunday (10/24), I just switched to 50 mg after being on 40 mg for a week and 30 mg for two weeks. That evening, I experienced a hypertensive crisis and had to go to the ER.\n\nMy concern is that I don’t know what caused it. I obviously want to avoid another hypertensive crisis because the combined experience—the excruciating pain, ER visit, American ER costs, and anxiety that followed—was absolutely horrible. So I hope by posting details here, y’all may be able to help me figure out what happened.\n\n**Background**\n\nI am a 21-year-old female \\[height: 5’2” (\\~157 cm), weight: probably low 90s lb (\\~41 kg)\\] with no history of blood pressure issues. My heart rate has always been high (90–110 bpm) since I was 14 at least, even when I was not taking medication (started meds at 17) or experiencing food issues. No one has investigated why. I have never been overweight. I max out or exceed the max recommended dosage of most medications—and I have been on quite a few classes—due to no effects, intended or adverse. So to have side effects beyond dry mouth on a medication is new to me, except for tremors on lithium and a seizure on Wellbutrin. I don’t get withdrawals from medication either, including after having stopped desvenlafaxine (Pristiq) cold turkey.\n\nI am currently taking:\n\n* 250 mg armodafinil cut into four doses taken throughout the morning and afternoon for EDS (sometimes I don’t take all of it);\n* 500 mg Keppra 2x/day for that seizure I had on Wellbutrin in January 2019;\n* 1.5 mg Vraylar at bedtime for dissociation and intrusive thoughts;\n* 10/20/20 mg (50 mg total) Parnate in the morning and afternoon for severe TRD;\n* (not Rx) 21 mg nicotine patches that I initially started as 14 mg for sleep drunkenness 20 min during the waking process (including after naps), but now I essentially wear them all day (not night) due to the extreme worsening of EDS on Parnate; I even started smoking cigarettes but will switch to vaping pure tobacco due to its added MAO inhibition and rapidly administered nicotine;\n* (not Rx) frequent cannabis use throughout the day for dissociation and depression/anxiety to a lesser extent; \n* and (not Rx) 25–50 mg doses of caffeine as needed.\n\nMy doctor is aware of the unprescribed drug use. Only thing that he advised against was cigarettes.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\nAfter my hypertensive crisis, I asked my doctor about the following: \n\n* a prescription for nifedipine (20 mg every 2-4 hours as needed) so I can be prepared in case it happens again. I want to make a separate post exclusively complaining about how horrible that ER experience was because legitimate harm could’ve been done. My doctor agreed to send in this script so at least this anxiety has been resolved. \n* which and how much of a painkiller I can take for non-blood-pressure-related headaches or pain (answer: infrequent ibuprofen use, up to 800 mg 4 times daily). I asked the nurse as I was being discharged from the ER which painkiller I could take, she laughed and said “no clue” because apparently a patient who explains that she is taking an MAOI doesn’t warrant maybe looking into how to treat MAOI-related incidents. Mind you, I have a very high pain tolerance and my dissociation makes it easy to “turn off” even extreme physical pain, but this was the most painful thing I have experienced in at least a couple of years. I rarely take painkillers, so to get sent home with nothing but a still elevated BP of 160s/110s and that unsatisfactory “answer” from the nurse who tried to convince me that she “had” a severely autistic son who “only needed a dietary change” was very upsetting (particularly upsetting because I didn’t want to hear her bullshit due to my having a HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS and this was right after I listed my diagnosis of autism and I am literally taking this drug because my depression is so unresponsive and severe...). I digress again. \n* having to do with food, I asked for bloodwork to see whether I actually am malnourished and to what extent. I also asked for ferritin and vitamin D just to rule those out regarding EDS. Before I started medication for “insomnia” (it was hypersomnia with disrupted nocturnal sleep), I got bloodwork done and found that my iron and vitamin D were low. I took supplements of both but my EDS was unchanged despite my levels returning to normal. This was in 2017 when my diet was normal (i.e. I wasn’t periodically starving). \n* additionally, I asked again for a hormonal panel because that is a potential physiological cause of depression that I haven’t explored. My period has been irregular for almost a year, the hair on my face (chin especially) has been slightly getting longer and darker, I sweat excessively, my circulation and body temperature control have always been awful, my heart rate is naturally high (not yet known why), I have postural hypotension (I stay hydrated; worsened on Parnate), and I am obviously extremely sleepy and depressed. Some or all of these could be attributed to malnutrition (period and hair growth are recent), but most of these issues have been persistent for years and even prior to starting medications for mental illness/EDS. My doctor is finally sending in all these orders. More data, better treatment in theory.\n* whether I can spread out my pills to taking them in five administrations (six today) instead of three larger ones to minimize crashes, and whether—since I’ve only been experiencing sedation thus far—I can switch to taking them in the evening. Yes to both.\n\n**Hypertensive Crisis**\n\nOk, that was the background and next steps, now for the hypertensive crisis. On Sunday, I can’t remember what I ate earlier—probably crackers and a couple of mozzarella cheese sticks—but I do remember eating my first real meal of the day between 17:00 and 19:00 and being very hungry beforehand. It was one of those [frozen meals](https://www.goodnes.com/stouffers/products/fried-chicken-mashed-potatoes/) that my friend bought from my school’s convenience store; I froze it immediately. I have eaten this meal several times within the past month without issue. I will list the ingredients below:\n\n>potatoes, water, cooked breaded chicken breast with rib meat (chicken breast with rib meat, wheat flour, chicken broth, water, 2% or less of modified tapioca starch, salt, nonfat dry milk, spices and spice extractives \\[including paprika extract\\], dextrose, yeast extract, hydrolyzed yeast protein, disodium inosinate, disodium guanylate, sodium phosphates, garlic powder, onion powder. breading set in vegetable oil.), corn, cream, 2% or less of skim milk, chicken broth, modified cornstarch, onions, chicken fat, salt, soybean oil, bleached wheat flour, modified tapioca starch, spices, seasoning (salt, maltodextrin \\[corn, potato, sweet potato\\], dried turkey broth, flavoring, turkey fat, 2% or less of autolyzed yeast extract, citric acid, grill flavor \\[from sunflower oil\\], lactic acid, modified cornstarch, sesame oil, sodium citrate, sodium phosphate), maltodextrin, potassium chloride, caramel color, seasoning (maltodextrin, flavor, enzyme modified butterfat), autolyzed yeast extract, beef stock, beef fat, carrageenan, dried garlic, flavors, cultured whey, dried onions, natural flavors, onion powder, sugar, lactic acid, xanthan gum, corn oil, dried egg whites, yeast extract, dried beef broth, dextrose, fructose, enzyme modified cream, disodium phosphate, grill flavor (from sunflower oil and soybean oil), smoke flavoring, annatto color, turmeric color.\n\nAround 19:30 I started experiencing an occipital headache. I just turned off the pain since I figured it could be malnutrition and the fact that I had gone a few days without cigarettes (I was still wearing 21 mg patches though, which I later took off out of precaution, despite nicotine’s not affecting my BP) or maybe even playing music too loud (just got new earbuds). Then, the headache started to get progressively more painful until it became suddenly way more painful at 20:05 and started throbbing. I started to sweat profusely around 20:20 and had to strip my clothes. I decided to take a BP reading (pulse in parentheses) at 20:32 and it was 152/96 (52). At 20:36, it was 167/110 (60). I did a standing reading two minutes later to see if I could capitalize on my postural hypotension but it just gave me 167/106 (59). The pain was excruciating and I was sobbing uncontrollably, which is very unlike me. Even then, I didn’t want to go to the ER because I figured I could tough out the pain and that my BP would eventually go down. Both the systolic and diastolic numbers kept increasing, though, and I tried to drink water but felt like throwing up. This is what convinced me to go, along with the fear that I might fall asleep and not be able to monitor the situation. I don’t have many peers who are willing to help me at this point (being friends with a severely depressed and exhausted person is not easy), but one did offer to take me to the ER. We left at 20:57, when I got a slightly lower standing reading of 172/104 (60).\n\nThey gave me two 1 mg lorazepam IV 15 min apart. I told them not to let me sleep because my friend was waiting and because sleeping would not be indicative of my feeling better—I fall asleep dozens of times a day and can sleep through immense pain. My BP stayed below 180/120 in the ER, but just barely for the most part, and remained elevated, with the lowest of 148/100 (53) at 23:30. At 01:29, it was 151/109 (61). I was discharged around 02:30 with 160-something/111, I believe. All of these readings were while I was awake. I don’t remember at what time they let me sleep and for how long. All I know is that it was not due to the lorazepam because I couldn’t even feel it. But either that, the drama of the situation itself, or—let’s hope not—the hypertensive crisis and borderline hypertensive period messed with my memory of Sunday and Monday a bit. I had a minor headache on Monday and part of Tuesday.\n\n**Another Event**\n\nOn Wednesday evening, apparently, I didn’t learn my lesson because I ate leftovers on an empty stomach. I was eating mashed potatoes that my sister made for me days earlier. I feel bad that I have to throw out a good amount of my perishable food because I never have enough energy to prepare the food and everything is sold in big portions, so I end up eating old food a lot of the time. The potatoes smelled and tasted fine, but roughly 30 minutes after I ate half a medium serving, my BP shot up to 160/104 (55) (it was \\~90/60 before I ate). This time, I was prepared and applied something I learned: cannabis can cause marked postural hypotension in some individuals and I happen to be one of those individuals. I just usually counteract it with caffeine, salt, and water (my high nicotine intake doesn’t seem to affect my BP, but it does increase my heart rate slightly when I smoke cigarettes), or wait until it stabilizes before consuming more. It has been even lower on Parnate, though. But anyway. I immediately vaped cannabis (I was aiming for a small amount but forgot I needed a lot to feel the psychoactive effects, so I probably vaped too much in retrospect), stood up for 15–30 minutes, and my standing BP dropped to \\~120/80. I was so hungry and ambivalent to the events of Sunday and what just happened that I finished the potatoes after my BP dropped further and preemptively vaped more cannabis.\n\nIt finally registered with me the next day, though, as I skipped my class just so I could spend two hours eating a bagel and cream cheese out of anxiety. I was too tired—normal EDS, physical fatigue from the BP stuff, physical fatigue from hunger, and emotionally as this shit has just been too much—and depressed to go to classes the rest of the day and week.\n\n**Quitting?**\n\nThere is another option, and that is to come off this medication. It hasn’t helped my depression at all; however, this is hard to measure because I have not done hardly any work or attended many classes since starting Parnate roughly a month ago. To be a month behind in classwork is overwhelming and instills a feeling of hopelessness, especially as everyone is getting tired of my excuses (“It’s supposed to become stimulating at 40 mg!”, “Hypertensive crises are rare!”). So it could be that this is causing my depression to worsen. Being malnourished also affects mood and the metabolism of drugs obviously. Ugh, I just want—no, I *need*—this medication to work. Is there a point where I should call it quits if it continues to be ineffective or wreak havoc on my body? I.e., the most charitable point at which there is significantly good reason to believe Parnate won’t work if I continue taking it or increase dosage. I’m still planning to move up to 60 mg today.\n\nSorry for the essay. This is just a lot to process and deal with on my own.\n\nEdit: my BP continued to rise. It got up to 194/117 while I was waiting for my friend to arrive to take me to the ER, which I think technically constitutes a hypertensive crisis; I stopped taking readings for a bit after that due to the pain, so it could’ve been even higher. All of my readings at the ER were below 180/120, though. I just tested my cuff recently and it’s accurate.",

        "body": "I'm sorry you went through this. I imagine being in so much pain + the blood pressure readings must have been really scary. Did you have any other symptoms beside the pain and anxiety?\nThe thing is, your BP readings weren't near hypertensive emergency levels. What you experienced was a hypertensive urgency at best. I don't want to diminish how horrible you felt, just saying that from a physiological point of view you weren't in any real danger. That is also why they only gave you lorazepam and not any specific blood pressure lowering med. \n\nPlease be careful with the nifedipin. Some say it shouldn't even be used in ICU settings anymore as there are much safer meds available. But it should certainly not be used outside of a hospital setting. The recommendation of taking 20mg every 2-4 hours seems downright crazy. Especially with a BP as volatile as yours. If you absolutely feel the need to take it, please don't take more than one dose at most. Nifedipin could easily throw you into severe hypotension that could be so much more dangerous than the painful BP spike you experienced. Frankly, I think having some clonidine at hand would be a much more adequate option. It takes longer to kick in, but you could take it as soon as you start feeling you're reacting to something.\n\nYour food reactions do seem weird and kind of random. Even if you were super sensitive to tyramine, one day being fine with the same brand of mozzarella sticks and then suddenly not is strange. Also the mashed potatoes shouldn't be that much of a problem even if stored for a few days. If it was meat it would be a different story.\n\nIn that situation even your Doc can probably only guess what's going on. You were right to ask for all those tests and get your heart rate issues checked. The good thing is, if they results come up with something it can probably be easily treated and you might feel much better soon. The modafinil, nicotine, caffeine, heck even the other meds could also have played a role in this. Even if you tolerated them well before, maybe the cocktail just doesn't agree with parnate.\n\nHopefully you'll get some answers soon. I know how awful it is to not be able to trust your body.",

Did you take your armodafinil these days and how much of it? Any extra amounts or nioctine, caffeine than usual? At what time did you take your dose or dosages of Parnate? All these things plus dose increases can quickly add up to causing a problem especially when \"timed right\". I think it's likely the various stimulants you're taking together that are causing this.",

        "body": "I read your full post. I can tell from your writing that you're smart and educated. With all your troubles, that is very impressive. Plus the fact that you seem to be attending university. It reminded me of my own uni days and when at some point I was utterly depressed and sleeping 18 hours a day. \n\nHere are my observations and a few suggestions:\n\n* You're mixing an awful number of different substances with an MAOI. It's beyond my knowledge to comment on its safety. Hopefully not beyond your treating physician's (but I have doubts about that considering the nifedipine script, read on)\n\n* The only thing that looks suspect to me in those ingredients is a few mentions of yeast. But there are also so many things I don't recognize. I'm far from an expert here. \n\n* Some people are more sensitive to tyramine than others and that's a known fact. You seem to be one. Attenuation of tyramine reaction through augmentation with a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI, e.g. nortriptyline) may be worth discussing with your doctor. See this https://psychotropical.com/attenuation_of_the_maoi_pressor_response_by_nris/\n\n* I'm impressed that the ED doctors didn't treat your hypertension too aggressively and just let it run its course (plus lorazepam). Tyramine reaction is often more scary than it is dangerous. It's self-limiting and aggressive treatment of the hypertension can be much more harmful. \n\n* Please research tyramine reaction and its management/treatment before using nifedipine. I suggest you start with this link and also read some of the references (especially those that cover treatment of hypertensive crises in general, and also nifedipine). TL;DR: I'd get that nifedipine out of your house. Good to have a benzodiazepine handy to use next time if needed (hopefully won't happen again though). \nhttps://psychotropical.com/maois-tyramine-hypertension-nifedipine/\n\n* Unrelated to your question: if you haven't already, please seek a neurologist's opinion (better yet, an epileptologist's) regarding getting anti-epileptic treatment long after what seems to have been an isolated seizure induced by a drug well-known for causing seizures. You absolutely don't want to risk having a seizure, but I wonder if at this point a careful tapering under expert supervision (and EEG etc) is an option. Not suggesting you just stop your Keppra, to be clear.\n\nFinally, it would be wise to stick with fresh food and perhaps to avoid or limit frozen food. You never know how it's been stored before it reaches you. Though frozen food is generally listed as safe, so maybe it was one of the ingredients after all. Quite baffling indeed. \n\nI wish you the best of luck.\n\nUpdate: I can see many have questioned whether your reactions have been food related. Given the evening onset of at least one of your episodes, Parnate hypertension seems unlikely to me as I believe it should happen within a few hours of a dose (unless you took your Parnate very late that day?). Was there anything else that you took or used, or did differently (extra dose etc) prior to a hypertensive episode?",

I rode it out at home out of anxiety of going to the ER but I was beyond scared and felt absolutely horrible. Really scary. \n\nParadoxical hypertension is very common after a dose increase on an MAOI and I’ve started increasing my dose by 5mg rather than 10mg when I decide to move up in order to avoid another one.\n\nEdit: didn’t see the other comments for some reason but they are giving you good info :)",

That's too much ibuprofen - 400mg three times a day is as much as you should take regularly along with 1g paracetamol 4 times a day.\n\nId strongly advise you take that nifedipine to a pharmacist and hand it in. Taking it with your blood pressure transiently elevated is dangerous as the drop in BP it can lead to when the episode is subsiding on its own can cause low blood flow and has led to a form of stroke. This is why its use has largely been abandoned, I certainly wouldn't use it. \n\nA fast, short acting beta blocker like propranolol would be better if you really want to have a pill at home. You might actually find a longer acting one regularly could help you with a couple of things you describe. \n\nSounds like a good general physician (internist) might be useful to give you a bit of a unified approach as this is all a bit beyond the remit of all but a very keen primary care doc.\n\nHope that is of some use. (I'm a gen med physician but now work in a subspecialty field.)",

    "body": "Welcome to the complete guide of how to make cocaine. If you do   everything right you are going to be king of the world, either in your   own world or in the real world. Please read the disclaimer at the end of   this text.  Now, let's get to action!  The basic formula for cocaine starts by purchasing or making tropinine,   converting the tropinone into 2-carbomethoxytropinone (also known as   methyl-tropan-3-one-2-carboxylate), reducing this to ecgonine,   and changing that to cocaine.     Succindialdehyde. This can be purchased, too. 23.2 g of succinaldoxime   powder in 410 ml of 1 N sulfuric acid and add dropwise with stirring at   0* a solution of 27.6 g of sodium nitrite in 250 ml of water over   3 hours. After the addition, stir and let the mixture rise to room temp   for about 2 hours, taking care not to let outside air into the reaction.   Stir in 5 g of Ba carbonate and filter. Extract the filtrate with ether   and dry, evaporate in vacuo to get the succindialdehyde. This was t  aken from JOC, 22, 1390 (1957). To make succinaldoxime, see JOC, 21,   644 (1956).    Complete Synthesis of Succindialdehyde. JACS, 68, 1608 (1946). In a 2 liter   3 necked flask equipped with a stirrer, reflux condenser, and an addition   funnel, is mixed 1 liter of ethanol, 67 g of freshly distilled pyrrole, and   141 g of hydroxylamine hydrochloride. Heat to reflux until dissolved, add   106 g of anhydrous sodium carbonate in small portions as fast as reaction   will allow. Reflux for 24 hours and filter the mixture. Evaporate the   filtrate to dryness under vacuo. Take up the residue in the minimum amount   of boiling water, decolorize with carbon, filter and allow to recrystallize   in refrigerator. Filter to get product and concentrate to get additional   crop. Yield of succinaldoxime powder is a little over 40 g, mp is 171-172*.    5.8 g of the above powder is placed in a beaker of 250 ml capacity and   54 ml of 10% sulfuric acid is added. Cool to 0* and add in small portions   of 7 g of sodium nitrite (if you add the nitrite too fast, nitrogen dioxide   fumes will evolve). After the dioxime is completely dissolved, allow the   solution to warm to 20* and effervescence to go to completion. Neutralize   the yellow solution to litmus by adding small portions of barium carbonate.   Filter off the barium sulfate that precipitates. The filtrate is 90% pure   succindialdehyde and is not purified further for the reaction to create   tropinone. Do this procedure 3 more times to get the proper amount for the   next step, or multiply the amounts given by four and proceed as described   above.    Take the total amount of succinaldehyde (obtained from 4 of the above   syntheses combined) and without further treatment or purification (this had   better be 15.5 g of succindialdehyde) put into an Erlenmeyer flask of   4-5 liters capacity. Add 21.6 g of methylamine hydrochloride, 46.7 g of   acetonedicarboxylic acid, and enough water to make a total volume of 2   liters. Adjust the pH to 8-10 by slowly adding a saturated solution of   disodium phosphate. The condensate of this reaction (allow to set for   about 6 days) is extracted with ether, the ethereal solution is dried   over sodium sulphate and distilled, the product coming over at 113* at   25 mm of pressure is collected. Upon cooling, 14 g of tropinone   crystallizes in the pure state.    2-Carbomethoxytropinone. A mixture of 1.35 g of sodium methoxide   (this is sodium in a minimum amount of methanol), 3.5 g of tropinone,   4 ml of dimethylcarbonate and 10 ml of toluene is refluxed for 30 min.   Cool to 0* and add 15 ml of water that contains 2.5 g of ammonium chloride.   Extract the solution after shaking with with four 50 ml portions of   chloroform, dry, evaporate the chloroform in vacuo. Dissolve the oil   residue in 100 ml of ether, wash twice with a mixture of 6 ml of   saturated potassium carbonate and three ml of 3 N KOH. Dry and evaporate   in vacuo to recover the unreacted tropinone. Take up the oil in a solution   of aqueous ammonium chloride and extract with chloroform, dry, and evaporate   in vacuo to get an oil. The oil is dissolved in hot acetone, cool, and   scratch inside of flask with glass rod to precipitate   2-carbomethoxytropinone. Recrystallize 16 g of this product in 30 ml of hot   methyl acetate and add 4 ml of cold water and 4 ml of acetone. Put in   freezer for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Filter and wash the precipitate with cold   methyl acetate to get pure product.    Methylecgonine. 0.4 mole of tropinone is suspended in 80 ml of ethanol   in a Parr hydrogenation flask (or something that can take 100 psi and not   react with the reaction, like stainless steel or glass). 10 g of Raney   Nickle is added with good agitation (stirring or shaking) followed by   2-3 ml of 20% NaOH solution. Seal vessel, introduce 50 psi of hydrogen   atmosphere (after flushing vessel with hydrogen) and heat to 40-50*.   After no more uptake of hydrogen (pressure gauge will hold steady after   dropping to its lowest point) bleed off pressure and filter the nickle off,   rinse out bottle with chloroform and use this rinse to rinse off the nickle   while still on the filter paper. Make the filtrate basic with KOH after   cooling to 10*. Extract with chloroform dry, and evaporate the chloroform   in vacuo to get an oil. Mix the oil plus any precipitate with an equal   volume of dry ether and filter. Add more dry ether to the filtrate until   no more precipitate forms, filter and add to the rest of the precipetate.   Recrystallize from isopropanol to get pure methylecgonine. Test for activity.   If active, skip down to the step for cocaine. If not active, proceed as   follows. Stir with activated carbon for 30 min, filter, evaporate in vacuo,   dissolve the brown liquid in methanol, and neutralize with 10% HCl acid in   dry ether. Evaporate the ether until the two layers disappear, and allow to   stand for 2 hours at 0* to precipitate the title product. There are many   ways to reduce 2-carbomethoxytropinone to methylecgonine. I chose to design   a Raney Nickle reduction because it is cheap and not as suspicious as LAH   and it is much easier than zinc or sodium amalgams.    Cocaine. 4.15 g of methylecgonine and 5.7 g of benzoic anhydride in 150 ml   of dry benzene are gently refluxed for 4 hours taking precaution against   H20 (the 2 should be on a lower level) in the air (drying tube). Cool in an   ice bath, acidify carefully with hydrochloric acid, dry, and evaporate in a   vacuum to get a red oil which is treated with a little portion of isopropanol   to precipitate cocaine.    As you can see, this is quite a chore. The coca leaves give ecgonine, which   as you can see, is only a jump away from cocaine. If you can get egconine,   then dissolve 8 1/2 g of it in 100 ml of ethanol and pass (bubble) dry HC1   gas through this solution for 30 min. Let cool to room temp and let stand   for another 1 1/2 hours. Gently reflux for 30 min and evaporate in vacuo.   Basify the residue oil with NaOH and filter to get 8.4 g of methylecgonine,   which is converted to cocaine as in the cocain step above.    Below is given a somewhat easier method of producing tropinone by the   general methods of Willstatter, who was instrumental in the first synthetic   production of cocaine and several other alkaloids. After reviewing this   method, I found it to be simpler than the above in many respects.    Tropinone. 10 g of pyrrolidinediethyl diacetate are heated with 10 g of   cymene and 2 g of sodium powder, the reaction taking place at about 160*.   During the reaction (which is complete in about 10 min) the temp should not   exceed 172*. The resulting reaction product in dissolved in water, then   saturated with potassium carbonate, and the oil, which separates, is boiled   with dilute sulfuric acid. 2.9 g of tropinone picrate forms and is filtered.  Here are two more formulas devised by Willstatter that produce tropinone   from tropine. Take note of the yield differences.    Tropinone. To a solution of 25 g tropine, dissolved in 10 times its weight   of 20% sulfuric acid are added 25 g of a 4% solution of potassiumpermanganate   in 2 or 3 g portions over 45 min while keeping the temp at 10-12*. The   addition of permanganate will cause heat (keep the temp 10-12*) and   precipitation of manganese dioxide. The reaction mixture is complete in   1 hour. A large excess of NaOH is added and the reaction is steam distilled   until 1 liter of distillate has been collected. The tropinone is   isolated as the dibenzal compound by mixing the distillate with 40 g of   benzaldehyde in 500 cc of alcohol and 40 of 10% sodium hydroxide solution.   Let stand several days to get dibenzaltropinone as yellow needles.   Yield: 15.5 g, 28%. Recrystallize from ethanol to purify.    Tropinone. A solution of 12 g of chromic acid in the same amount of   water (12 g) and 60 g of glacial acetic acid is added dropwise with stirring   ov (trimmed due to comment size limit)",

        "body": "Welcome to the complete guide of how to make cocaine. If you do   everything right you are going to be king of the world, either in your   own world or in the real world. Please read the disclaimer at the end of   this text.  Now, let's get to action!  The basic formula for cocaine starts by purchasing or making tropinine,   converting the tropinone into 2-carbomethoxytropinone (also known as   methyl-tropan-3-one-2-carboxylate), reducing this to ecgonine,   and changing that to cocaine.     Succindialdehyde. This can be purchased, too. 23.2 g of succinaldoxime   powder in 410 ml of 1 N sulfuric acid and add dropwise with stirring at   0* a solution of 27.6 g of sodium nitrite in 250 ml of water over   3 hours. After the addition, stir and let the mixture rise to room temp   for about 2 hours, taking care not to let outside air into the reaction.   Stir in 5 g of Ba carbonate and filter. Extract the filtrate with ether   and dry, evaporate in vacuo to get the succindialdehyde. This was t  aken from JOC, 22, 1390 (1957). To make succinaldoxime, see JOC, 21,   644 (1956).    Complete Synthesis of Succindialdehyde. JACS, 68, 1608 (1946). In a 2 liter   3 necked flask equipped with a stirrer, reflux condenser, and an addition   funnel, is mixed 1 liter of ethanol, 67 g of freshly distilled pyrrole, and   141 g of hydroxylamine hydrochloride. Heat to reflux until dissolved, add   106 g of anhydrous sodium carbonate in small portions as fast as reaction   will allow. Reflux for 24 hours and filter the mixture. Evaporate the   filtrate to dryness under vacuo. Take up the residue in the minimum amount   of boiling water, decolorize with carbon, filter and allow to recrystallize   in refrigerator. Filter to get product and concentrate to get additional   crop. Yield of succinaldoxime powder is a little over 40 g, mp is 171-172*.    5.8 g of the above powder is placed in a beaker of 250 ml capacity and   54 ml of 10% sulfuric acid is added. Cool to 0* and add in small portions   of 7 g of sodium nitrite (if you add the nitrite too fast, nitrogen dioxide   fumes will evolve). After the dioxime is completely dissolved, allow the   solution to warm to 20* and effervescence to go to completion. Neutralize   the yellow solution to litmus by adding small portions of barium carbonate.   Filter off the barium sulfate that precipitates. The filtrate is 90% pure   succindialdehyde and is not purified further for the reaction to create   tropinone. Do this procedure 3 more times to get the proper amount for the   next step, or multiply the amounts given by four and proceed as described   above.    Take the total amount of succinaldehyde (obtained from 4 of the above   syntheses combined) and without further treatment or purification (this had   better be 15.5 g of succindialdehyde) put into an Erlenmeyer flask of   4-5 liters capacity. Add 21.6 g of methylamine hydrochloride, 46.7 g of   acetonedicarboxylic acid, and enough water to make a total volume of 2   liters. Adjust the pH to 8-10 by slowly adding a saturated solution of   disodium phosphate. The condensate of this reaction (allow to set for   about 6 days) is extracted with ether, the ethereal solution is dried   over sodium sulphate and distilled, the product coming over at 113* at   25 mm of pressure is collected. Upon cooling, 14 g of tropinone   crystallizes in the pure state.    2-Carbomethoxytropinone. A mixture of 1.35 g of sodium methoxide   (this is sodium in a minimum amount of methanol), 3.5 g of tropinone,   4 ml of dimethylcarbonate and 10 ml of toluene is refluxed for 30 min.   Cool to 0* and add 15 ml of water that contains 2.5 g of ammonium chloride.   Extract the solution after shaking with with four 50 ml portions of   chloroform, dry, evaporate the chloroform in vacuo. Dissolve the oil   residue in 100 ml of ether, wash twice with a mixture of 6 ml of   saturated potassium carbonate and three ml of 3 N KOH. Dry and evaporate   in vacuo to recover the unreacted tropinone. Take up the oil in a solution   of aqueous ammonium chloride and extract with chloroform, dry, and evaporate   in vacuo to get an oil. The oil is dissolved in hot acetone, cool, and   scratch inside of flask with glass rod to precipitate   2-carbomethoxytropinone. Recrystallize 16 g of this product in 30 ml of hot   methyl acetate and add 4 ml of cold water and 4 ml of acetone. Put in   freezer for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Filter and wash the precipitate with cold   methyl acetate to get pure product.    Methylecgonine. 0.4 mole of tropinone is suspended in 80 ml of ethanol   in a Parr hydrogenation flask (or something that can take 100 psi and not   react with the reaction, like stainless steel or glass). 10 g of Raney   Nickle is added with good agitation (stirring or shaking) followed by   2-3 ml of 20% NaOH solution. Seal vessel, introduce 50 psi of hydrogen   atmosphere (after flushing vessel with hydrogen) and heat to 40-50*.   After no more uptake of hydrogen (pressure gauge will hold steady after   dropping to its lowest point) bleed off pressure and filter the nickle off,   rinse out bottle with chloroform and use this rinse to rinse off the nickle   while still on the filter paper. Make the filtrate basic with KOH after   cooling to 10*. Extract with chloroform dry, and evaporate the chloroform   in vacuo to get an oil. Mix the oil plus any precipitate with an equal   volume of dry ether and filter. Add more dry ether to the filtrate until   no more precipitate forms, filter and add to the rest of the precipetate.   Recrystallize from isopropanol to get pure methylecgonine. Test for activity.   If active, skip down to the step for cocaine. If not active, proceed as   follows. Stir with activated carbon for 30 min, filter, evaporate in vacuo,   dissolve the brown liquid in methanol, and neutralize with 10% HCl acid in   dry ether. Evaporate the ether until the two layers disappear, and allow to   stand for 2 hours at 0* to precipitate the title product. There are many   ways to reduce 2-carbomethoxytropinone to methylecgonine. I chose to design   a Raney Nickle reduction because it is cheap and not as suspicious as LAH   and it is much easier than zinc or sodium amalgams.    Cocaine. 4.15 g of methylecgonine and 5.7 g of benzoic anhydride in 150 ml   of dry benzene are gently refluxed for 4 hours taking precaution against   H20 (the 2 should be on a lower level) in the air (drying tube). Cool in an   ice bath, acidify carefully with hydrochloric acid, dry, and evaporate in a   vacuum to get a red oil which is treated with a little portion of isopropanol   to precipitate cocaine.    As you can see, this is quite a chore. The coca leaves give ecgonine, which   as you can see, is only a jump away from cocaine. If you can get egconine,   then dissolve 8 1/2 g of it in 100 ml of ethanol and pass (bubble) dry HC1   gas through this solution for 30 min. Let cool to room temp and let stand   for another 1 1/2 hours. Gently reflux for 30 min and evaporate in vacuo.   Basify the residue oil with NaOH and filter to get 8.4 g of methylecgonine,   which is converted to cocaine as in the cocain step above.    Below is given a somewhat easier method of producing tropinone by the   general methods of Willstatter, who was instrumental in the first synthetic   production of cocaine and several other alkaloids. After reviewing this   method, I found it to be simpler than the above in many respects.    Tropinone. 10 g of pyrrolidinediethyl diacetate are heated with 10 g of   cymene and 2 g of sodium powder, the reaction taking place at about 160*.   During the reaction (which is complete in about 10 min) the temp should not   exceed 172*. The resulting reaction product in dissolved in water, then   saturated with potassium carbonate, and the oil, which separates, is boiled   with dilute sulfuric acid. 2.9 g of tropinone picrate forms and is filtered.  Here are two more formulas devised by Willstatter that produce tropinone   from tropine. Take note of the yield differences.    Tropinone. To a solution of 25 g tropine, dissolved in 10 times its weight   of 20% sulfuric acid are added 25 g of a 4% solution of potassiumpermanganate   in 2 or 3 g portions over 45 min while keeping the temp at 10-12*. The   addition of permanganate will cause heat (keep the temp 10-12*) and   precipitation of manganese dioxide. The reaction mixture is complete in   1 hour. A large excess of NaOH is added and the reaction is steam distilled   until 1 liter of distillate has been collected. The tropinone is   isolated as the dibenzal compound by mixing the distillate with 40 g of   benzaldehyde in 500 cc of alcohol and 40 of 10% sodium hydroxide solution.   Let stand several days to get dibenzaltropinone as yellow needles.   Yield: 15.5 g, 28%. Recrystallize from ethanol to purify.    Tropinone. A solution of 12 g of chromic acid in the same amount of   water (12 g) and 60 g of glacial acetic acid is added dropwise with stirring   ov (trimmed due\n^((trimmed due to comment size limit)^)",

    "body": " \n\nWas chatting with my wife as we listened (danced) to an old Simon & Garfunkel album (thanks to [**Music\\_is\\_my\\_life33**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Music_is_my_life33/) for the inspiration) and she suggested I share this story.\n\nThis particular S&G album is old... like, my dad bought it new in 1972 or 73 when it first came out old. I have another copy of it, but this one is special as my dad has now passed. I inherited both his Pioneer turntable and his few remaining records. Both the player and the records were in bad shape. I've since refurbed the player, but many of the records had literal mold on them, plus decades of garage dirt and dust. I've never had great luck cleaning these, and they always crackled and popped like crazy, so I've mostly archived them to avoid damage to my styluses (stylii?).\n\nUp to this point, my cleaning protocol has been pretty basic. I start by using MoFi style inners and outers for protection, then wipe with a carbon fiber brush before putting on the platter. If dirtier, I break out Groovewasher G2, their microfibre and usually finish with a velvet brush. Those old records tho? Never been able to play them without tons of noise.\n\nAs an (non-practicing) engineer and homebrewer, I started thinking to myself - what is the research behind cleaning records? Could I get my dads old records playable? Did I already have the chemicals to make an awesome cleaner? Could I make my new discs sounds better?\n\nFast forward a few weeks, and after a lot of google-fu, I decided to try making my own record cleaner. As an avid homebrewer, I use vinyl for the tubing in my kegerator beer lines, so I was familiar with selecting cleaners that prevent breakdown of vinyl.\n\nBased on the research by many others smarter than me, I made a list of the key components needed for super cleaning vinyl:\n\n\\- builder  \n \\- oxidizer (dissipates significantly after mixing)  \n \\- metasilicate  \n \\- surfactant  \n \\- chelating agent  \n \\- detergent  \n \\- enzymatic cleaner  \n \\- alchohol\n\nThen I made a list of compatible chemicals that fit the bill for the primary cleaner (excluding the enzymatic cleaner and alcohol), looking at the SDS sheets of various available products/chemicals and comparing against the PVC chemical interaction database to ensure they fall into the \"Excellent\" category of interaction (ie A2, A1 and A):\n\nTrisodium phosphate  \n Disodium phosphate  \n Sodium hypochlorite  \n Sodium hydroxide  \n Sodium carbonate  \n Sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate  \n Sodium polycarboxylate  \n Sodium Xylenesulfonate  \n Sodium cumene sulfonate  \n Disodium metasilicate  \n Propylene glycol  \n Octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol  \n Tetrasodium EDTA  \n Alcohol ethoxylate  \n Methylisothiazolinone  \n Methylchloroisothiazolinone\n\nFinally I came up with several available home products chemicals that filled as many of these as possible. The result was a mixture(s) of the following:\n\n\\- Distilled Water  \n \\- Powdered Brewery Wash (aka PBW)  \n \\- Diversol  \n \\- Kodak Photo Flow  \n \\- Maxill Zymax\n\nI am still playing with ratios, however my current solution is using a 473ml/16oz spray bottle, mixed with the following:  \n \\- 7.0g PBW  \n \\- 2.0g Diversol  \n \\- 3ml Kodak Photo Flow  \n \\- 4ml Maxill Zymax  \n \\- Distilled water to fill bottle to 16oz\n\nYou'll notice there is no alcohol present here - instead I have a second spray bottle mixed with a 20% alcohol solution that I use to remove any residue, fingerprints, etc after initial cleaning. With this solution I get no buildup on the needle, but my next test will be to use pure distilled and see if that provides similar results so I can ditch the alcohol entirely.\n\nI then set about testing this solution using my dads old records. This was my process:\n\n\\- use carbon fibre brush to clean acrylic platter  \n \\- remove record from sleeve and slowly run carbon fibre brush over both sides to remove dust and static before putting on platter  \n \\- spin platter and spray record with cleaning agent  \n \\- start player up at regular (33) rpm and use a nylon brush to spread out the fluid so it covers entire surface  \n \\- stop and let sit ... for as long as I am patient (often 30s-1m)  \n \\- set RPM to 78  \n \\- use nylon brush again to remove dirt  \n \\- use a clean, lint free microfibre cloth to remove surface liquid until mostly dry  \n \\- spray with 20% alcohol solution  \n \\- use goat hair brush (I use a german boot polishing brush) to spread and clean  \n \\- use a separate microfibre to remove liquid until mostly dry  \n \\- use velvet brush to remove last liquid and surface dirt  \n \\- polish gently with Zeiss XL lens cloth  \n \\- final pass with carbon fibre brush\n\nThat's ... a lot. But the whole process is 2-3m tops. The result: silent records. Honestly, for the first time ever I can actually listen to my dads records without all the background noise. They are nearly as silent as my new discs now! Plus the dust level has reduced dramatically - a lot of this is due to removing static from the platter and disc *before* you place the record on the player. Try it! I admit I am also a weirdo and have 3 layers of hand cut dryer sheets under my acrylic platter... but they do seem to work 🤷🏼‍♂️\n\nOf course YMMV, take with a grain of salt, etc etc - and I am not a genius or real chemical engineer, but DAMN, my listening enjoyment just went through the roof. My dad's records are back in play, and my new records sound better than ever.\n\nFeedback and corrections appreciated - I would love to further improve this with the feedback from others (smarter than me). Thanks for reading fam!\n\nEDIT: Spelling",

It's around 25£ but it goes on sale often for 1/3rd off, and it's done wonders for restoring my desert dry skin.

After that is boiling I extract about 22lbs of syrup and add 50lbs of powdered sugar. Let it mix for 5min. I then add 17lbs(left over syrup) into the mixer. Viola. KK glaze. \n[Dude you are awesome!

    "body": "Hi! I'm currently trying to find a new cleanser and doing a bit of a shakeup of my skincare routine. I'm not the biggest fan of oil cleansing but I'm liking balms for massage. I think my skin is fairly normal all over, but dehydrated. I try to use cruelty free wherever possible, so preferably stuff that isn't sold in China either (no Clinique or anything). What I'm using...\n\nMornings Liz Earle Cleanse and Polish - I like this, easy to use and cleans my face well, doesn't give me spots of anything BUT my skin always feels a little too tight after using it. (Aqua (water), Caprylic/capric triglyceride, Theobroma cacao (cocoa) seed butter, Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl esters, Cera alba (beeswax), Glycerin, Polysorbate 60, Sorbitan stearate, Eucalyptus globulus leaf oil, Humulus lupulus (hops) extract, Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, Anthemis nobilis (chamomile) flower extract, Phenoxyethanol, Panthenol, Benzoic acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic acid, Sodium hydroxide, Limonene, Citric acid.)\n\nHydraluron - not feeling a huge difference with using this but I'm trying to finish the tube. My skin does feel softer after using it, not sure about hydration. (Water/Aqua/Eau, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ahnfeltia Concinna Extract, Carbomer, Butylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, PhenoxyethanoL)\n\nTrilogy Vital Moisturising Cream - loving this, my skin feels so much better. (Aqua (Water), Glycerin (Vegetable), Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Wheat Straw Glycosides (and) Cetearyl Alcohol, Rosa Canina (Rosehip) Seed Oil, Sclerocarya Birrea (Marula) Seed Oil, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange) Flower Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Parfum, Citral, Geraniol, Limonene, Linalool.)\n\nEvenings Liz Earle C+P - as above. takes my makeup off nicely\n\nEmma Hardie cleansing balm - not the biggest fan of the smell and I think it's given me a couple of spots (could just be stress/travelling though)? Love the texture, possibly too high in essential oils? Also ridiculously expensive I feel. (Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-8 Beeswax, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, PEG-60 Almond Glycerides, Sorbitan Stearate, Palmitic/Stearic Triglycerides, Limonene, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Silica, Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange) Flower Oil, Citrus Nobilis (Mandarin Orange) Peel Oil, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Aqua (Water), Lecithin, Linalool, Butylene Glycol, Octyldodecyl PCA, Menthyl PCA, Tocopherol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Crithmum Maritimum Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Moringa Pterygosperma Seed Extract, Jasminum Officinale (Jasmine) Flower Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Disodium Phosphate, Citronellol, Citric Acid, Geraniol, Citral.)\n\nFirst Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads - skin does feel a lot clearer and spots seem to disappear quicker when I use these. (Water/Eau, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycerin, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Water, Lactic Acid, Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Camellia Sinensis (White Tea) Leaf Extract, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Citrus Nobilis (Mandarin Orange) Fruit Extract, Hyaluronic Acid, Phyllanthus Emblica (Indian Gooseberry) Fruit Extract, Polysorbate 20.)\n\nAntipodes Divine Oil - 3 or 4 drops depending on how my skin's feeling, I do notice a difference in my skin when I don't use it. (Persea gratissima (avocado oil), Macadamia ternifolia (macadamia oil), Buxus chinensis (jojoba oil), Rosa canina (rosehip oil), Canaga odorata (ylang ylang oil), Amyris balsamifera (torchwood), Santalum album (sandalwood oil), Jasminum officinale (jasmine oil), Citrus sinensis (orange oil), Tocopherol acetate (vitamin e), Benzyl benzoate+, Benzyl salicylate+, Citronellol+, D-limonene+, Farnesol+, Geraniol+, Isoeugenol+, Linalool+. * Ingredients certified organic by AgriQuality. + Components of essential oils.)\n\nTrilogy Vital Moisturising cream - as above\n\nI want to try The Trilogy night cream (Aqua (water), Sweet almond oil, Cetearyl alcohol, Certified Organic Rosehip Oil , Cetearyl olivate (and) sorbitan olivate, Coco-caprylate, Goji Berry, Rosapene™, Oat extract, Acai oil, Honey (mel), Aloe vera leaf extract, Evening primrose oil, Marula oil, Avocado oil, Chamomile flower extract, Calendula officinalis flower extract (and) glycine soja (soybean) oil, Cocoa seed butter, Vitamin E, Parfum, Rosemary leaf extract, Citric acid, Dehydroacetic acid (and) benzyl alcohol, Citral, Geraniol, Citronellol, Limonene, Linalool.)\n\nand the MOA green balm (Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Cera Alba (Beeswax), Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow) Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, CI 75810 (Chlorophyll), Limonene (occurs naturally in tea tree oil)). Thoughts?\n\nAnything wrong with this routine or anything you'd recommend? I want one that's just easy to use, but still does good and smells good too - I just know if something doesn't smell good I won't use it. My skin isn't a fan of Shea butter or anything rose/geranium related (except for rose hip, that seems to make it happy). I also need a new spot treatment, I've got the Clinique one at the moment but obviously don't want to repurchase. Otherwise I just put extra divine oil on which seems to help or witch hazel gel.

This makes the monosodium the acid for this problem.  You can solve this from this point in one of two ways: 1) Intuition: Monosodium phosphate is the acid in this case and will decrease the pH if more is added 2) pH = pKa + log (base/acid).  If you increase acid, you have a smaller log value which decreases the pH",

Those of us with sensitive skin should avoid any flushable wipe (DUDE Wipes, Kirkland Fragrance•Free, Cottonelle, etc.) These wipes contain harmful chemicals that can irritate delicate skin (this can also throw off pH balance in females which can lead to further issues such as urinary tract infections (UTI), yeast infections, and BV). These wet wipes contain chemicals that keep them wet for long periods of time. I'm going to put Kirkland on blast since they have had a recent law suit against them. So what chemicals are in these? Let me list them :) \n\nINGREDIENTS: PURIFIED WATER, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, DISODIUM COCOAMPHODIACETATE, CITRIC ACID, DISODIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, PHENOXYETHANOL, SODIUM BENZOATE.\n\nAfter some thorough research on these ingredients, those of us with sensitive skin who are prone to contact dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, etc. should NOT use wet wipe products on either themselves or a child who may have sensitive skin. \n\nWhat are some common symptoms after using wet wipes?:  itching, burning, irritation, allergic reactions \n\nHow can you treat this? Go to a licensed health care professional to help you decipher whether it’s just an allergic or if it’s turned into an infection . Other treatment may include antibiotics if it is an infection or a topical steroid cream which may also be prescribed. Topical steroid treatment that is OTC includes hydrocortisone or cortisone creams/gels (no difference one is brand name while the other is not- but they both contain same ingredients and are used to treat the same ailments). \n\nI truly hope that this can help someone avoid the excruciating pain and suffering that accompanies wet wipe usage. I know that contact dermatitis usually doesn’t become life threatening, but the symptoms are quite uncomfortable. 🥴 \n\nMany of us are uncomfortable talking about a subject matter like this. It’s definitely awkward. By spreading knowledge about this, we can protect our health, our plumbing, and the environment. \n\nPSA: DON’T BUY THESE!!!! It’s not worth it x ",

So if we have this sodium phosphate buffer then HA = NaH2PO4, A- = Na2HPO4-. Won't the acid dissociate until it reaches its equilibrium between HA and A-? My attempt to reason the correct answer: \n\nH2PO4 -> H+ + HPO4- = pKa 7.2 (This is our monosodium phosphate)\n\nHPO4- -> H+ + PO4-2 = pKa 12.3 (This is our disodium phosphate)\n\nWe currently have a pH of 7.6, so our ratio of monosodium phosphate to disodium phosphate is such that we are somewhere between these two pKa's (7.2 and 12.3), and since we're at 7.6 we have more monosodium than disodium phosphate, but not enough to get to the desired 7.2 pH. Therefore, if we add even more monosodium phosphate, we will  bring the pH down. \n\nIs this right? I'm really not great at chem so if anyone is a chem major or a chem wizard I am all ears because even if my above explanation is correct I do not think I conceptualize it well enough to replicate if a similar question comes up on test day. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ftlofxi08rd91.png?width=1362&format=png&auto=webp&s=f33b0c1b3c7b414c9c4024db6e16276bebad0941",

        "body": "Here is how I think of this problem. \n\nThe current pH is 7.6 we need the buffer to be 7.2 therefore we will need to add acid to this solution. Since we are near the 7.2 pKa we will be dealing with the transition between H2PO4^- (acid component) and HPO4^2^- (base component).\n\nAnswer choice A adds the base component of the buffer so this would take the pH in the wrong direction. \n\nAnswer choice B adds base so it is also wrong.\n\nAnswer choice C is saying increase the monosodium (NaH2PO4) amount since this is the acid component this would be adding acid and is therefore correct\n\nAnswer choice D adds a little bit of water to the solution which can alter the pH but 100 mL is a pretty small amount so I wouldn’t expect this to change the pH",

What is the logic behind this? Is it because the first hydrogen is least strongly held to the molecule and therefore dissociates more easily? And when we have only one hydrogen remaining it is experiencing a great attraction to the phosphorus and therefore less likely to dissociate?",

If you are truly prone to cavities ask your dentist to prescribe high fluoride toothpaste.",

    "body": "I am currently testing Krave Beauty The Great Barrier Relief. Its the only addition in my current skincare routine. I am pairing it with my tretinoin cream at night and use it as moisturizer in the morning. So far so good I have no bad reaction and would like to see if it will help with the dark pimple marks. Will update you guys on the result. ❤\n\nAt first I was kinda hesitant to buy it number 1 due to the price point and number 2 due to ingredients that may cause fungal acne, but if you are not prone to fungal acne like me then you are good to go. I am on my 3rd day of using it and so far no fungal acne appeared on my face. Also this seems like a game changer as I have seen a lot of improvement with dark spots. To really test its efficacy i stopped all the serum and active ingredient I am using. I am only using basic cleanser which is heimish, then green tea toner from isntree GBR the  sunscreen from isntree. At night heimish cleanser, green tea toner then tretinoin cream then GBR. Note that the only new thing I used is GBR. My skin already improved and had no active pimple due to tretinoin but my concern is the dark spots so far I think that GBR is doing a great job in diminishing dark spots and pimple scars on my face ❤\n\nIngredient list: \nWater, Propanediol, Calophyllum Inophyllum Seed Oil (10%), Dipropylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Olivate, Polysorbate 60, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Glyceryl Oleate, Sorbitan Olivate, Sorbitan Oleate, Octyldodecanol, Glycerin, Butylene glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Squalane, Serine, Acetyl Glutamine, Glycine, Ceramide NP, Oleic Acid, Sodium PCA, Glycosyl Trehalose, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterols, Saccharide Isomerate, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Flour, Disodium Phosphate, Sodium Phosphate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Lactic Acid, Xanthan gum, Urea, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Hydrogenated Olive Oil Unsaponifiables, Magnesium Chloride, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glyceryl Caprylate, Pentylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA",

Even if the rinses are identical, I dislike everything Sensodyne stand for and the way they market their products. If you go on their website, you will see what I mean when I say, they are trying to scare patients into thinking they have acid wear to ultimately make them buy their products. \n\nAs for sensitivity, just try put as many minerals into your teeth as you can, and try avoid acidic foods/drinks and you should be grand.

    "body": "Do you take care of your family? Goes without saying. Do you take care of your home? Of course. Do you take care of your heart? Probably not. It may not be at the top of most poeple’s to-do lists, but caring for your heart through a healthy diet and regular physical activity is the secret weapon to preventing heart disease. While many may assume that popping a few pills that your healthcare provider prescribed is enough to quell symptoms or prevent a heart attack, the real preventative power lies with real changes to your lifestyle – which can reduce the risk for heart disease by as much as 80 percent. Read on to find out how. Use the following tips to embark on a heart-healthy lifestyle to fight heart disease.\n1.\tSchedule a Yearly Checkup \n Your heart is in your hands. Each year on your birthday, schedule a checkup to have your blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose levels checked, and ask your doctor to help you reach or maintain a healthy weight. Be sure to follow your healthcare professional's recommendations, including taking prescribed medications as directed.\n2.\tGet Physical\n Step, march or jog in place for at least 15 minutes a day while watching your favorite TV shows. Increase your activity by five minutes each week until you're getting a minimum of 30 minutes most days of the week. If exercise and diet do not get you to your goal, ask your doctor about adding medication. Keep your numbers in check: Get Physical\n3.\tDrink More Water\n Take a water bottle with you wherever you go. It'll keep you hydrated and the bottle's weight will strengthen your arms.\n\n\n\n4.\tEat Healthy\n Keep packages of unhealthy food hidden. Put raw veggies and fruits in front in the refrigerator and healthy snacks in the front of the pantry, so that's what you see first. If you grab healthy foods for a minimum of 21 times, healthy choices will become a habit. Also, look for the American Heart Association red and white heart-check mark. This easy, reliable grocery shopping tool helps you identify foods that can be part of a sensible eating plan. Keep your numbers in check.\n5.\tControl Cholesterol\n Eating foods high in saturated fat, trans fat or cholesterol can lead to high blood cholesterol. To help keep your cholesterol levels down, eat foods low in saturated fat and trans fat, such as lean chicken or turkey (roasted or baked, with skin removed), fruits and veggies, low-fat or fat-free dairy products and whole grains.\n6.\tCut Down on Salt\n To help lower high blood pressure, watch your salt intake. It may be disguised in food labels as sodium alginate, sodium sulfite, sodium caseinate, disodium phosphate, sodium benzoate, sodium hydroxide, monosodium glutamate (MSG), or sodium citrate.\n7.\tQuit Smoking\n Try this four-step way to kick your habit:\n•On Day 1, cut the number of cigarettes you smoke by half\n•On Day 3, cut the number of cigarettes you smoke in half again\n•And on Day 5, cut your smoking in half again\n•On your Quit Day... quit!\n\n8.\tMaintain a Healthy Weight\n Excess weight increases your risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. To achieve steady, painless weight loss, take it easy. Each day, if you eat 200-300 calories less than you would normally consume, and exercise at least 30 minutes on most or all days of the week, you'll get closer to your goal and be able to achieve weight loss that's steady and painless.\nIn addition to the physical toll a lack of exercise takes on the body, a whopping 65 percent of all American adults today are obese or overweight, increasing their risk for heart disease. So, follow these tips and make sure to care for your heart!\n",

Easy enough. I'm using Cerave hydrating facial cleanser,Alastin regenerating skin nectar + Vanicream when needed, and the tinted Elta MD UV Elements Broad-Spectrum SPF 44. I typically use Farmacy Green Clean Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm to take off my SPF before applying moisturizer. I used it evening of procedure and day after. I looked up the product because I'm almost out and happened to look at the ingredients and it has papaya enzymes in it which is an exfoliating ingredient! It's pretty high up on the list of ingredients, too. Will my results be impacted by this? I'm obviously not using it anymore and will be using Dermalogica precleanse to remove my SPF (no exfoliators, just oils and vitamin e) but I'm really scared. My face feels and looks fine but my cheeks don't have nearly as much post surgery pigmentation then I thought/was hoping it would have. My skin hasn't begun to flake yet and I know that the post-procedure pigmentation is a good thing before shedding starts. Am I overreacting?

For the 3rd hydrogen (trisodium) the pka is \\~12.7, so definitely a base.\n\nThe same trend occurs for other polyprotic acids, though you'd have to check the specific pka's to see which forms are acidic or basic at neutral pH.

I've been doing 16:8 and keeping to the typical 12-8pm schedule with my work hours etc. From 7am to 4-5pm I'm usually at my desk or in meetings all day where I work. I keep a pitcher of water next to me that I pour myself a cold glass from about every hour. My coworker brought in these welch's singles to go packs that you can add to your 16oz water bottle to add flavor etc. I'm wondering if adding one or 2 to my pitcher of ice water will break my fast at all? I normally just have a black coffee in the mornings with a splash of cream. According to the welch's nutrition facts a 1/2 stick is 5 calories. So a whole in a 16.9oz bottle of water equates to about 10 calories. If I add 2 of these to a pitcher of water, if I had to guesstimate probably, the pitcher is something like 64oz of water to the brim, I have it usually about 3/4 full and drink most of it throughout my day. Would this break my fast at all? I'm guessing the dilution of the 2 packs probably is less then 20 calories total.

My skin absolutely loves the RF Active Hydration Serum (will include list of ingredients at end of post). It's a mix of hyaluronic acid and glycerin, but despite it being a mix of these two common ingredients I am having a hard time finding something that works similarly on my skin.\n\nSo far I have tried TO HA 2% + B5 and the Hado Labo HA Lotion (blue label). The TO one pills on my skin terribly even after using a minimal amount and letting it soak in for an hour, so I don't think it does anything but just sit on my skin. I like the Hado Labo one, but it doesn't give me the same kind of light glow that the RF Serum does (perhaps it is the glycerin in the RF AHS that does that?). I really like the RF AHS primarily as a daytime moisturizer because it doesn't pill no matter what I put over it (despite dimethicone being the third ingredient) and it sits well under any sunscreen and makeup, it soaks in quickly, and it doesn't make my oily parts too greasy.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for something that has a similar feel and performance on the skin with perhaps similar ingredients, but at a lower price point?\n\nRodan+Fields Active Hydration Serum ingredients for reference:\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Glycerin, Bis-PEG-12 Dimethicone, Pentylene Glycol, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Ceramide NP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide EOS, Tocopherol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Sea Salt/Maris Sal/Sel Marin, Cetyl Hydroxyethylcellulose, Calcium PCA, Magnesium PCA, Lecithin, Caprooyl Phytosphingosine, Caprooyl Sphingosine, Gellan Gum, Ceteareth-25, Lactic Acid, Cetyl Alcohol, Behenic Acid, Cholesterol, Hydrated Silica, Silica Dimethyl Silylate, Disodium Phosphate, Fragrance/Parfum, Hexylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Limonene.",

(It's a German brand, so there isn't much about them on this sub!) I love them in so many ways - they’re pleasant to use, my skin feels well-moisturised, and they’re the only products that have never stung or burned me when my skin is in bad shape. I started using them after my spots went a bit haywire last summer, so I know they didn't trigger my bad skin (which I think is mainly hormonal, with pustules, papules and CCs on my chin and increasingly along my jawline)--but I’d really appreciate some input on whether there are any big red flags I’m missing that may be keeping my skin bad. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know the non-SPF cream has “parfum” in it (supposedly “skin-friendly”), but for a long time I was only using the SPF 30 version (including at night) which doesn’t have parfum in it. I switched to the non-SPF version at night once I figured out you need to clean sunscreen off at night, which actually reduced my CCs a little initially, but my skin has continued to get worse since then.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI haven't been able to figure out what triggered my skin getting worse and didn't really have a routine before last year, so I went through the big names recommended here and ending up with Dermasence because nearly everything else irritated me in some way. I’m thinking of switching to CeraVe at least for a while to see if that makes a difference, but it does sting me a little sometimes (Cetaphil stung so badly I had to wash it off after half an hour). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI’ve been to a derm a couple of months ago and I’m going again in six weeks, but it would be super helpful to know whether my skin just hates me or whether I may be agitating it with these products. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you so much--I feel really overwhelmed by trying to figure out the ingredient science side of skincare!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDermasence Soft Cream\n\nAqua, cetearyl isononanoate, persea gratissima (avocado) oil, glycerin, carbomer, tocopheryl acetate, tocopherol, panthenol, sodium stearoyl glutamate, lecithin, dicaprylyl ether, xanthan gum, bisabolol, sorbitol, lactic acid, sodium hydroxide, salicylic acid, benzoic acid, dehydroacetic acid, p-anisic acid, ascorbyl palmitate, hydrogenated palm glycerides citrate, parfum\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDermasence Soft Cream SPF 30\n\nAqua, dicaprylyl ether, glycerin, dicaprylyl carbonate, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, ethylhexyl salicylate, octocrylene, phenylbenzimidazole sulfonic acid, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine, panthenol, bisabolol, tocopheryl acetate, titanium dioxide (nano), cyclopentasiloxane, phenoxyethanol, sodium stearoyl glutamate, glyceryl stearate, pentaerytrityl distearate, butyrospermum parkii butter, aminomethyl propanol, cetearyl alcohol, acrylates/c10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, microcrystalline cellulose, cellulose gum, diethylhexyl sodium sulfosuccinate, caprylyl glycol, disodium phosphate, piroctone olamine, propylene glycol, silver chloride, alumina, simethicone",

Does any creamy dressing qualify as ranch? \n\n>Ranch dressing is a type of salad dressing (sauce) made of some combination of buttermilk, salt, garlic, onion, mustard, herbs (commonly ***chives, parsley, and dill***), and spices (commonly black pepper, paprika, and ground mustard seed), mixed into a sauce based on mayonnaise, or another oil emulsion. Sour cream and yogurt are sometimes used in addition to or as a substitute for buttermilk and mayonnaise. Ranch dressing has been the best-selling salad dressing in the United States since 1992, when it overtook Italian dressing\n\nThat is from wiki, note the \"chives, parsley, and dill\", spices that many recipes leave out. so if you leave out those spices you just made creamy dressing, but is it really Ranch? \n\nNow here is where it gets weird. Ranch was actually develop by Hidden Valley, they made the original Ranch dressing. Here is the ingredients of Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing today \n\n>Ingredients: Vegetable oil (soybean and/or canola), water, egg yolk, sugar, salt, cultured nonfat buttermilk, natural flavors (soy), less than 1% of: spices (mustard), dried garlic, dried onion, vinegar, phosphoric acid, xanthan gum, modified food starch, monosodium glutamate, artificial flavors, disodium phosphate, sorbic acid and calcium disodium edta as preservatives, disodium inosinate, disodium guanylate. Contains: Egg, Milk, Soy.\n\nthe only spices it lists are (mustard), dried garlic, dried onion, vinegar\n\nThere is no chives, parsley, or dill on that list! So how is that Ranch? \n\nI guess Ranch just mean \"creamy dressing of some type\" now? \n\nI don't get it. I always thought Dill was the signifying flavor of Ranch but so many recipes leave it out entirely. \n\nAm I wrong here? Have I lost my mind?",

Thoughts on those?\n\nAlternatively, any suggestions on how to make a quick white mac & cheese from scratch on the stovetop? I’ve never made my own, and the internet is full of suggestions\n\nI was considering making a béchamel sauce (minus the nutmeg), however I don’t keep milk on hand. Could I try it with full fat Greek yogurt (this is what I usually add to my Annie’s in place of milk)?\n\nNext, how would it get the cheddar flavor, just stir in grated sharp white cheddar cheese?\n\nOr can I just melt together some grated sharp white cheddar cheese with Greek yogurt and make a sauce, and skip the béchamel?\n\nAlso, in googling some redditors suggested this:\n- “I think it would be easy enough to get the consistency of the Annie's sauce by making a thin bechamel (put a tbsp butter in a medium-hot pan, add a tbsp flour and stir to make a paste, and add milk a little at a time until it's runny, whisking as you go) and then adding cheese. You want something that will not become stringy/stretchy, which would mean going for hard, aged cheeses. I would guess a combination of Parmesan, aged cheddar, and maybe a dash of pecorino Romano for that tangy flavor”\n- “Yeah, I'd recommend a thin bechamel.\nAdd the cheese on very low heat or even off the heat, though, because hard cheeses can break easily. Especially hard cheddar, in my experience. You could also use a bit of yogurt or sour cream to get the tanginess.”\n- “I agree, l'd do a runny roux based sauce, could possibly be broth instead of dairy”",

    "body": "Hi all! I have recently realized that this nightmare I have been going through for the last 15 months is a damaged moisture barrier. I had clear skin for the majority of my life but was using salicylic acid products like crazy. When I went off the BCP, my acne came back so I overdid it with the actives. Now most products burn on my face and I am struggling with rosacea for the first time in my life. My skin seems “saggy” in places and I can see texture and that every pore on my face is inflamed. I also have these little bumps that come and go. I went to 3 dermatologists when this issue first started and my face was still burning. All 3 suggested I use a retinoid product or laser therapy to fix the texture. How crazy is that- I know that would have made everything worse! Luckily I did some research online and I cut out all actives last summer (12 months ago) so my face doesn’t burn anymore but I still can’t fix the texture. I have found a routine that works ok- it seems like my skin looks normal when I put my moisturizer on but that only lasts about 30 minutes. Then my skin is oily and dry at the same time again and my pores are pronounced with little fine lines everywhere. Here is my routine:\n\nMorning:\nSodium Sulfacetamide Lotion 10%,\nDr Jart Ceramidin Lotion,\nMurad Nutrient Charged Water Gel,\nElta MD UV Clear Sunscreen \n\nNight:\nBoscia Makeup Breakup Cleansing Oil,\nEminence Stone Crop Gel Wash,\nCaudalie Moisturizing Toner,\nSodium Sulfacetamide Lotion 10%,\nDr Jart Ceramidin Lotion,\nMurad Nutrient Charged Water Gel\n\nThe Murad Water Gel ingredient list is as follows. It has a lot of good stuff in it but I think I might need an occlusive to seal it in: Water, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Propanediol, Saccharide Isomerate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane/Silica Crosspolymer, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Isononyl Isononanoate, Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Sh-Oligopeptide-1, Sh-Oligopeptide-2, Sh-Polypeptide-1, Sh-Polypeptide-9, Sh-Polypeptide-11, Saccharomyces/Zinc Ferment, Saccharomyces/Copper Ferment, Saccharomyces/Magnesium Ferment, Saccharomyces/Iron Ferment, Saccharomyces/Silicon Ferment, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Bacillus/Folic Acid Ferment Extract, Trehalose, Taurine, Serine, Tocopheryl Acetate, Calcium Pantothenate, Niacinamide, Phytantriol, Acetyl Glutamine, Urea, Cholesterol, Yeast Amino Acids, Phytosphingosine, Inositol, Betaine, Lecithin, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Pyridoxine HCl, Sucrose, Algin, Pullulan, Maltodextrin, Polysilicone-11, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Decyl Glucoside, Pentylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Isononanoate, Polyisobutene, Silica, Sodium Starch Octenylsuccinate, PEG-7 Trimethylolpropane Coconut Ether, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium Phosphate, Potassium Phosphate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, Red 33 (CI 17200), Red 4 (CI 14700).\n\nAlso, how do you get the occlusive off your skin in the morning? (I currently don’t wash my face in the morning). Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!",

        "body": "Have you tried it before or asking can you?\n\nIt really depends on how long you fast. In the grand scheme of extended fasting, 48 hours is really not that long. You more than likely won't experience refeeding syndrome or anything too bad (it usually kicks in around ~96 hours). I frequently do 72 hour+ fasts and my only rule is to not break fast with carbs or certain high density proteins, everything else is pretty fair game. But that's my body and experiences may vary. \n\nMy recommendation is to give a try and see how you feel. Every body reacts differently. Some people have iron gut microbiomes and can break long fasts with anything and everything. Others can't and need to ease in to it more gradually with longer breaks between small meals. There's nothing necessarily wrong with that pre-workout. Again, just give it a shot and see how you feel and make the call from there.\n\nGood luck!",

Which method will  adjust the solution to the proper pH?

In the solution, they say \" Adding strong base, diluting with water, or adding a different basic salt will not lower the pH\" But, wouldn't diluted the solution decrease the \\[Base\\], therefore decreasing the pH? \n\nAlso, why do acids have characteristic pH's.
