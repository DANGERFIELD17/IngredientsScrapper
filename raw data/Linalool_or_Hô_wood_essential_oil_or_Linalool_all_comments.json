    "body": "Hi everyone! I posted this on another sub not too long ago and because of the positive reaction I wanted to share it with you all. Hope you like it.      \n      \nLittle bit about me/my skin: Im 25F and I have sensitive, acne prone, combination skin. My skin is especially sensitive to fragrance, citrus and floral essential oils. Because of this I’ve become a bit of a skincare nerd and an obsessive ingredients list reader. I definitely still have a lot to learn about skincare but I hope this list helps some of you! Especially my fellow sensitive skin skincare addicts.          \n                \nI tried to keep the reviews very short and straight forward, but if you want me to expand on any products let me know!           \n           \n1.        **La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer 30 SPF - 3/10**                    \n*Pros:* Fragrance free and very moisturizing.        \n*Cons:* Broke me out and burned my eyes\nBest for: dry skin.      \n       \n2.        **Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser - 0/10**       \n*Pros:* literally nothing.        \n*Cons:* I don’t like the smell, it broke me out, didn’t remove my makeup well.         \n \n3.        **Drunk Elephant Beste No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 6/10**\n*Pros:* Clean ingredients list.          \n*Cons:* Stripping/drying and expensive.         \n*For who?* Oily skin or those that like to feel squeaky clean.     \n       \n4.        **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 60 SPF (American) - 3/10**            \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast.    \n*Cons:* Greasy, broke me out, stung my eyes.    \n*Bottom Line:* Stick to the European version.     \n       \n5.         **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 50+ SPF (European) - 9/10**          \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast, reasonably priced.    \n*Cons:* texture is a little too runny for my liking.    \n*Bonus:* LRP donates to skin cancer research.    \n       \n6.         **Jordan Samuel Hydrate Facial Serum - 0/10**       \n*Pros:* Couldn’t try long enough to say.    \n*Cons:* Gave me a bright red burning skin reaction.     \n*Bottom Line:* Looks like they changed their formula (for good reason obvi) so I can’t speak for the new version.     \n*For who?* Those who want an excuse to cancel dinner plans.    \n       \n7.         **Mario Badescu Rose Facial Spray - 0/10**    \n*Pros:* Cheap.   \n*Cons:* Mist comes out too strong, I don’t like the smell, contains fragrance, citronellol, geraniol and colorants.   \n*Bottom Line:* Thank goodness it was a gift, because I won’t be buying.   \n     \n8.        **The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 5/10**    \n*Pros:* Unscented, affordable.    \n*Cons:* Made my skin itch and left a residue.    \n*Bottom Line:* I won’t repurchase.   \n     \n9.         **A313 Vitamin A Pommade - 10/10**   \n*Pros:* My pimples reduced, skin texture improved (after two weeks). Thick vasaline texture that locks in the vitamin A.      \n*Cons:* Slight metallic smell     \n*Bottom Line:* Worth the hype! I use 2x a week max, alternating with a salicylic acid oil.    \n    \n10.   **Youth to the People Superberry Dream Cleansing Balm - 3/10**    \n*Pros:* Great ingredient list, interesting extracts.     \n*Cons:* Smells like waxy crayons, crumbly texture that doesn’t melt well into the skin, left a waxy feeling behind.     \n*Bottom Line:* I’ve tried better.    \n       \n11.   **Tata Harper Water-Lock Moisturizer - 2/10**  \n*Pros:* I liked her organic Vermont farm story and the light gel cream texture.   \n*Cons:* strong fragrance, contains skin irritants like Alcohol, limonene, citral, citronellol, linalool and orange peel extract.   \n*Bottom Line:* Don’t use if you have sensitive skin. There is a sunburn warning on the side of the box because it contains AHAs.    \n \n12.    **Saturday Skin Carrot + Niacinamide Moisturizing Cream - 6/10**  \n*Pros:* Hydrating thick gel cream.    \n*Cons:* Smells so strong of silicone.   \n*Bottom Line:* Bought it in Europe, loved it. Bought it in the US, smelled like straight up silicone. Different formula maybe?     \n     \n13.   **Glossier Future Dew - 0/10**  \n*Pros:* Cute packaging.   \n*Cons:* Made me look like a greasy pizza, broke me out and don’t like the smell.   \n   \n14.   **Versed Sunday Morning Antioxidant Oil-Serum – 1/10**  \n*Pros:* inexpensive.   \n*Cons*: Does nothing. The biphase ends up looking gross and muddled after a while.    \n   \n15.   **Murmure Bisou Clarifying Dry Oil – 10/10**  \n*Pros:* Cleared my blackheads, sinks into the skin fast.    \n*Cons:* Contains hazelnut oil so be careful if you have an allergy!     \n*Bottom Line*: I use it about 2x a week at night (not on the same day as my retinol). My skin is always less red and bumpy in the AM.    \n    \n16.    **Typology Glycolic Acid 10% - 3/10**   \n*Pros:* Affordable (Typology is like the French version of the Ordinary).    \n*Cons*: Broke me out, 10% glycolic acid is too strong for my skin.    \n     \n17.   **Nuxe Huile Prodigieuse Multi-Purpose Dry Oil – 9/10**  \n*Pros:* Nice dry oil that soaks in quickly, love the smell (I only use this on my body so the fragrance doesn’t bother me).   \n*Cons:* Wish it had a dropper or pump to make application less messy.   \n*Bottom Line:* I put this all over my body after my shower and my skin feels baby soft.   \n     \n18.   **Innisfree Daily UV Defense Sunscreen 36 SPF – 5/10**  \n*Pros:* Good value for money.   \n*Cons:* Broke me out, a little too oily.   \n*Bottom Line:* They have changed the formula since I tried it so I cant speak for the new formulation.     \n     \n19.   **La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5+ - 7/10**   \n*Pros:* Super soothing and healing.   \n*Cons:* clogged my pores (avoid if you have acne or milia prone skin).   \n*Bottom Line:* I would buy again for my eyelid dermatitis that I get every winter\nFor who? Dry, irritated skin.         \n20.   **SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic Serum - 8/10**    \n*Pros:* Brightened and evened my skin tone.   \n*Cons:* So expensive it hurts! Oxidized at around the 4 month mark. Smells slightly unpleasant.   \n*Bottom Line:* One of the most effective formulas for vitamin c that Ive tried. Keep it away from light and to close the bottle tightly so it doesn’t oxidize as quickly.    \n      \n21.   **Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Ultra-fine Mist – 1/10**  \n*Pros:* Cute packaging.   \n*Cons:* Broke me out, overpowering candy fragrance, didn’t hydrate.    \n     \n22.   **Pillow Talk Derm Major Fade Flash Mask – 0/10**  \n*Pros:* I can’t speak to the effectiveness of the product because my skin couldn’t handle it.    \n*Cons:* Instantly burned my face into a red mess.    \n*Bottom Line:* 15% glycolic acid was too much for my skin. Make sure to always patch test new products.    \n      \n23.   **The Outset Nourishing Squalane Daily Moisturizer – 7/10**  \n*Pros:* Clean ingredients list, nice light texture.    \n*Cons:* Not hydrating enough for my skin.    \n*Bottom Line:* If you have sensitive skin and like a lightweight moisturizer it might be worth a try.    \n    \n24.   **Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy – 10/10**   \n*Pros:* Heals, hydrates/seals in moisture.   \n*Cons:* Packaging is kinda ugly.   \n*Bottom Line:* Cult classic for good reason. I’m team Aquaphor over vasaline every day.   \n      \n25.   **Skinfix Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream – 10/10**   \n*Pros:* Super hydrating and nourishing. Nice cream gel texture.   \n*Cons:* none.   \n*Bottom Line:* My sensitive skin loves this moisturizer. Even though I have acne prone skin I still prefer their normal triple lipid over their gel version.       \n26.   **Saturday Skin Yuzu Vitamin C Sleep Mask – 4/10**  \n*Pros:* slightly brightening.   \n*Cons:* Strong smell, contains citrus oils, feels quite sticky.   \n     \n27.    **Youth to the People Superfood Air-Whip Moisture Cream – 3/10**   \n*Pros:* nice light airy texture.   \n*Cons:* Has fragrance and limonene. Didn’t do much.   \n*Bottom Line:* Last time I was at sephora I did notice that the cream is no longer a light green color, so I think they changed the formula.   \n    \n28.    **Caudalie Beauty Elixir Face Mist – 0/10**  \n*Pros:* None.   \n*Cons:* Doesn’t smell great, does nothing, has alcohol, fragrance, rosemary oil, citral, linalool, citronellol…).   \n*Bottom Line:* Outdated product imo.  \n    \n29.    **Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen 40 SPF – 5/10**  \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast.   \n*Cons:* Expensive and broke me out.    Feels very silicone heavy. like my skin was suffocating.    \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive acne prone skin beware.   \n     \n30.    **U beauty The Plasma Lip Compound (Rose) – 0/10**   \n*Pros:* Couldn’t keep it on my lips long enough.   \n*Cons:* Smells so bad like straight up chemicals.   \n*Bottom Line:* So disappointing because it was really expensive.   \n    \n31.    **Youth to the People Polypeptide-121 Future Cream – 7/10**   \n*Pros:* Hydrating and plumping.   \n*Cons:* Started to smell a little funny when I got halfway through the jar.   \n    \n32.   **Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm – 8/10**   \n*Pros:* Nice creamy texture that melts into the skin. Smells delicious and removes makeup well.   \n*Cons:* Leaves a greasy film on my eyes\nBottom Line: One of the few glow recipe products that I actually like.    \n  \n33.   **Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream (Night) – 1/10**\n*Pros:* lovely texture.   \n*Cons:* Smells way too strong, like straight up perfume. Has citral, limonene, lemon peel oil and fragrance.   \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive skin beware.   \n     \n34.   **Typology Niacinamide 12% - 5/10**   \n*Pros:* Inexpensive.   \n*Cons:* 12% niacinamide is too strong for my skin.   \n*Bottom Line:* studies show that your skin reacts best at a 4% concentration. I like to add a little into my moisturizer every so often to dilute it.   \n     \n35.    **Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask – 3/10**  \n*Pros:* Smells delicious (but has fragrance).       \n*Cons:* Made my lips more dry. I don’t like having to scoop into a jar.        \n*Bottom Line:* I don’t understand the hype of this product.    \n      \n36.   **Clarins Lip Comfort Oil - 9/10**  \n*Pros:* Not sticky, lasts a while and very shiny.   \n*Cons:* Wish there was more color payoff and kinda pricey (not doir expensive but getting there).    \n*Bottom Line:* My fav lip product to date.

Especially my fellow sensitive skin skincare addicts.          \n        \nI tried to keep the reviews very short and straight forward, but if you want me to expand on any products let me know!           \n           \n1.        **La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer 30 SPF - 3/10**                    \n*Pros:* Fragrance free and very moisturizing.        \n*Cons:* Broke me out and burned my eyes\nBest for: dry skin.      \n       \n2.        **Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser - 0/10**       \n*Pros:* literally nothing.        \n*Cons:* I don’t like the smell, it broke me out, didn’t remove my makeup well.         \n \n3.        **Drunk Elephant Beste No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 6/10**\n*Pros:* Clean ingredients list.          \n*Cons:* Stripping/drying and expensive.         \n*For who?* Oily skin or those that like to feel squeaky clean.     \n       \n4.        **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 60 SPF (American) - 3/10**            \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast.    \n*Cons:* Greasy, broke me out, stung my eyes.    \n*Bottom Line:* Stick to the European version.     \n       \n5.         **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 50+ SPF (European) - 9/10**          \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast, reasonably priced.    \n*Cons:* texture is a little too runny for my liking.    \n*Bonus:* LRP donates to skin cancer research.    \n       \n6.         **Jordan Samuel Hydrate Facial Serum - 0/10**       \n*Pros:* Couldn’t try long enough to say.    \n*Cons:* Gave me a bright red burning skin reaction.     \n*Bottom Line:* Looks like they changed their formula (for good reason obvi) so I can’t speak for the new version.     \n*For who?* Those who want an excuse to cancel dinner plans.    \n       \n7.         **Mario Badescu Rose Facial Spray - 0/10**    \n*Pros:* Cheap.   \n*Cons:* Mist comes out too strong, I don’t like the smell, contains fragrance, citronellol, geraniol and colorants.   \n*Bottom Line:* Thank goodness it was a gift, because I won’t be buying.   \n     \n8.        **The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 5/10**    \n*Pros:* Unscented, affordable.    \n*Cons:* Made my skin itch and left a residue.    \n*Bottom Line:* I won’t repurchase.   \n     \n9.         **A313 Vitamin A Pommade - 10/10**   \n*Pros:* My acne reduced, skin texture improved (after two weeks). Thick vasaline texture that locks in the vitamin A.      \n*Cons:* Slight metallic smell     \n*Bottom Line:* Worth the hype! I use 2x a week max, alternating with a salicylic acid oil.    \n    \n10.   **Youth to the People Superberry Dream Cleansing Balm - 3/10**    \n*Pros:* Great ingredient list, interesting extracts.     \n*Cons:* Smells like waxy crayons, crumbly texture that doesn’t melt well into the skin, left a waxy feeling behind.     \n*Bottom Line:* I’ve tried better.    \n       \n11.   **Tata Harper Water-Lock Moisturizer - 2/10**  \n*Pros:* I liked her organic Vermont farm story and the light gel cream texture.   \n*Cons:* strong fragrance, contains skin irritants like Alcohol, limonene, citral, citronellol, linalool and orange peel extract.   \n*Bottom Line:* Don’t use if you have sensitive skin. There is a sunburn warning on the side of the box because it contains AHAs.    \n \n12.    **Saturday Skin Carrot + Niacinamide Moisturizing Cream - 6/10**  \n*Pros:* Hydrating thick gel cream.    \n*Cons:* Smells so strong of silicone.   \n*Bottom Line:* Bought it in Europe, loved it. Bought it in the US, smelled like straight up silicone. Different formula maybe?     \n     \n13.   **Glossier Future Dew - 0/10**  \n*Pros:* Cute packaging.   \n*Cons:* Made me look like a greasy pizza, broke me out and don’t like the smell.   \n   \n14.   **Versed Sunday Morning Antioxidant Oil-Serum – 1/10**  \n*Pros:* inexpensive.   \n*Cons*: Does nothing. The biphase ends up looking gross and muddled after a while.    \n   \n15.   **Murmure Bisou Clarifying Dry Oil – 10/10**  \n*Pros:* Cleared my blackheads, sinks into the skin fast.    \n*Cons:* Contains hazelnut oil so be careful if you have an allergy!     \n*Bottom Line*: I use it about 2x a week at night (not on the same day as my retinol). My skin is always less red and bumpy in the AM.    \n    \n16.    **Typology Glycolic Acid 10% - 3/10**   \n*Pros:* Affordable (Typology is like the French version of the Ordinary).    \n*Cons*: Broke me out, 10% glycolic acid is too strong for my skin.    \n     \n17.   **Nuxe Huile Prodigieuse Multi-Purpose Dry Oil – 9/10**  \n*Pros:* Nice dry oil that soaks in quickly, love the smell (I only use this on my body so the fragrance doesn’t bother me).   \n*Cons:* Wish it had a dropper or pump to make application less messy.   \n*Bottom Line:* I put this all over my body after my shower and my skin feels baby soft.   \n     \n18.   **Innisfree Daily UV Defense Sunscreen 36 SPF – 5/10**  \n*Pros:* Good value for money.   \n*Cons:* Broke me out, a little too oily.   \n*Bottom Line:* They have changed the formula since I tried it so I cant speak for the new formulation.     \n     \n19.   **La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5+ - 7/10**   \n*Pros:* Super soothing and healing.   \n*Cons:* clogged my pores (avoid if you have acne or milia prone skin).   \n*Bottom Line:* I would buy again for my eyelid dermatitis that I get every winter\nFor who? Dry, irritated skin.         \n20.   **SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic Serum - 8/10**    \n*Pros:* Brightened and evened my skin tone.   \n*Cons:* So expensive it hurts! Oxidized at around the 4 month mark. Smells slightly unpleasant.   \n*Bottom Line:* One of the most effective formulas for vitamin c that Ive tried. Keep it away from light and to close the bottle tightly so it doesn’t oxidize as quickly.    \n      \n21.   **Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Ultra-fine Mist – 1/10**  \n*Pros:* Cute packaging.   \n*Cons:* Broke me out, overpowering candy fragrance, didn’t hydrate.    \n     \n22.   **Pillow Talk Derm Major Fade Flash Mask – 0/10**  \n*Pros:* I can’t speak to the effectiveness of the product because my skin couldn’t handle it.    \n*Cons:* Instantly burned my face into a red mess.    \n*Bottom Line:* 15% glycolic acid was too much for my skin. Make sure to always patch test new products.    \n      \n23.   **The Outset Nourishing Squalane Daily Moisturizer – 7/10**  \n*Pros:* Clean ingredients list, nice light texture.    \n*Cons:* Not hydrating enough for my skin.    \n*Bottom Line:* If you have sensitive skin and like a lightweight moisturizer it might be worth a try.    \n    \n24.   **Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy – 10/10**   \n*Pros:* Heals, hydrates/seals in moisture.   \n*Cons:* Packaging is kinda ugly.   \n*Bottom Line:* Cult classic for good reason. I’m team Aquaphor over vasaline every day.   \n      \n25.   **Skinfix Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream – 10/10**   \n*Pros:* Super hydrating and nourishing. Nice cream gel texture.   \n*Cons:* none.   \n*Bottom Line:* My sensitive skin loves this moisturizer. Even though I have acne prone skin I still prefer their normal triple lipid over their gel version.       \n26.   **Saturday Skin Yuzu Vitamin C Sleep Mask – 4/10**  \n*Pros:* slightly brightening.   \n*Cons:* Strong smell, contains citrus oils, feels quite sticky.   \n     \n27.    **Youth to the People Superfood Air-Whip Moisture Cream – 3/10**   \n*Pros:* nice light airy texture.   \n*Cons:* Has fragrance and limonene. Didn’t do much.   \n*Bottom Line:* Last time I was at sephora I did notice that the cream is no longer a light green color, so I think they changed the formula.   \n    \n28.    **Caudalie Beauty Elixir Face Mist – 0/10**  \n*Pros:* None.   \n*Cons:* Doesn’t smell great, does nothing, has alcohol, fragrance, rosemary oil, citral, linalool, citronellol…).   \n*Bottom Line:* Outdated product imo.  \n    \n29.    **Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen 40 SPF – 5/10**  \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast.   \n*Cons:* Expensive and broke me out.    Feels very silicone heavy. like my skin was suffocating.    \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive acne prone skin beware.   \n     \n30.    **U beauty The Plasma Lip Compound (Rose) – 0/10**   \n*Pros:* Couldn’t keep it on my lips long enough.   \n*Cons:* Smells so bad like straight up chemicals.   \n*Bottom Line:* So disappointing because it was really expensive.   \n    \n31.    **Youth to the People Polypeptide-121 Future Cream – 7/10**   \n*Pros:* Hydrating and plumping.   \n*Cons:* Started to smell a little funny when I got halfway through the jar.   \n    \n32.   **Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm – 8/10**   \n*Pros:* Nice creamy texture that melts into the skin. Smells delicious and removes makeup well.   \n*Cons:* Leaves a greasy film on my eyes\nBottom Line: One of the few glow recipe products that I actually like.    \n   \n33.   **Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream (Night) – 1/10**   \n*Pros:* lovely texture.   \n*Cons:* Smells way too strong, like straight up perfume. Has citral, limonene, lemon peel oil and fragrance.   \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive skin beware.   \n     \n34.   **Typology Niacinamide 12% - 5/10**   \n*Pros:* Inexpensive.   \n*Cons:* 12% niacinamide is too strong for my skin.   \n*Bottom Line:* studies show that your skin reacts best at a 4% concentration. I like to add a little into my moisturizer every so often to dilute it.   \n     \n35.    **Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask – 3/10**  \n*Pros:* Smells delicious (but has fragrance).       \n*Cons:* Made my lips more dry. I don’t like having to scoop into a jar.        \n*Bottom Line:* I don’t understand the hype of this product.    \n      \n36.   **Clarins Lip Comfort Oil - 9/10**  \n*Pros:* Not sticky, lasts a while and very shiny.   \n*Cons:* Wish there was more color payoff and kinda pricey (not doir expensive but getting there).    \n*Bottom Line:* My fav lip product to date.",

    "body": "I've copy/pasted this text multiple times now and decided to just make a separate post about it (and I admit I want to be lazy and just post a link instead of repeatedly copy/pasting a comment). Some of you may recognize a good portion of this, but I've added some points because I'm trying to make this post as comprehensive as possible.\n\nIn order to determine whether a product is water-based or silicone-based, you have to look at the ingredients. -Cone/-methicone, and -siloxane words near the top of the list tend to signal a silicone-based product. Water will be at the top of the list for any liquid product because water makes it liquidy. It doesn't mean that a product is water-based. Without water, the product would not be spreadable/blendable. For example:\n\nMAKE UP FOR EVER HD Microperfecting Primer Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Aqua (Water), **Dimethicone**, **Trisiloxane**, PEG-12 **Dimethicone**, **Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone** Crosspolymer, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Squalane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18 Methicone, Phenoxyethanol, Ceteth-10, Laureth-4, Ethylglycerin, Panthenol, Potassium Sorbate, Polysorbate 60, Parfum (Fragrance), Argania Spinosa Extract (Argania Spinosa Kernel Extract), C12-14 Pareth-12, Hydrolyzed Algin, Dodecene, Sorbitan Isostearate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Tromethamine, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. [CI 19140 (Yellow 5 Lake), CI 75470 (Carmine), CI 77007 (Ultramarines), CI 77288 (Chromium Oxide Greens), CI 77289 (Chromium Hydroxide Green), CI 77491 (Iron Oxides), CI 77492 (Iron Oxides), CI 77499 (Iron Oxides), CI 77742 (Manganese Violet), CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide)].\n\nSee the bold words? Definitely silicone-based! Again, the water keeps it a more liquid-y consistency so it's easily spreadable. It doesn't mean that the product is water-based. Particularly with primers, I can always tell because it has that \"silicone\" feeling. Now let's look at a water-based primer:\n\nLaura Mercier Foundation Primer - Oil Free Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Isodecyl Isononanoate, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, C22-20 Alcohols, Squalane, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Esters, Phenoxyethanol, Boron Nitride, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin Tocopherol Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hamaelis Viginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Cucumis sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Retinyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Polyamino Sugar Condesate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Chlorphensin, Benzoic Acid, Polysorbate 60, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Saccharomyces/Xylium Black Tea Ferment, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Potassium Sorbate, Green 5 (CI 61570), Yellow 5 (CI 19140).\n\nSee how there are no -cone/-methicone or -siloxane words near the top of the list? That means that it's water-based. This primer does contain dimethicone, which is a silicone, but it's relatively low on the list, which means that it contains a very small amount of silicone (ingredients are typically listed in order, beginning with what is in there most and ending with what is in there the least). Thus, because this primer contains much more water (and other ingredients) than silicone, it is water-based.\n\nOil-based foundations are exceptionally rare. After much searching, I finally found one: Alexandra de Markoff Countess Isserlyn Cream Makeup (another is NARS Balanced Foundation, which has been discontinued, so I could not find an easily copy/paste-able ingredients list). Let's look at the ingredients:\n\nWater (aqua), **Decyl Oleate**, **Lanolin Oil**, Propylene Glycol, Talc, Isotearic Acid, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetyl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Fragrance (parfum), Emulsifying Wax NF, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, PPG-12-PEG-65 Lanolin Oil, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben. May contain Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI77492, CI 77499, Ultramarines (CI77007)\n\nYes, water is listed as the first ingredient, but that is to keep the product more blendable. The second and third ingredients (in bold) are definitely oils. Phew! You don't know how many ingredients lists I went through to find that! I swear unicorns are easier to find! ANYWAY, they should play well with silicone-based primers. However, this is unlikely to be of concern to you because chances are you're not using an oil-based foundation (if you are using an oil-based foundation, check your closet for a herd of unicorns).\n\nIn general, you want water-based primers with water-based foundations (or tinted moisturizers, BB creams, CC creams, concealer, or any other base products; I'm just going to keep typing \"foundations\" for the sake of brevity), and silicone-based primers with silicone-based foundations. The two different bases (water and silicone) can cause your foundation to pill when layered on top of each other. In particular, using a silicone-based primer with a water-based foundation on top of it often causes the foundation to pill because the primer creates a silicone barrier. When you try to apply a water-based foundation on top of that, the silicone repels the water in the foundation, and the water in the foundation does not absorb properly into your skin, resulting in unevenness.\n\nPlease remember to moisturize well underneath your makeup (and to give your moisturizer time to absorb fully, meaning your skin should no longer have that \"tacky\" feeling that you have right after applying moisturizer). If you use sunscreen (which you should, especially with summer coming up), you need to let that absorb as well. The base of your moisturizer/sunscreen is irrelevant, because if you allow them to absorb completely, they will not affect makeup application at all. If you begin applying primer and foundation before your moisturizer and/or sunscreen has fully absorbed, they can cause your makeup to break up sooner, which is the opposite of what you want.\n\nAlong the same line, your powder is irrelevant to the base of your foundation/primer. There is no such thing as a water-based powder (it then wouldn't be a powder). If your powder isn't working with your foundation/primer and giving you the look that you want, it is not related to the base of your foundation/primer. Also, not everybody needs to use powder on top of their foundation, so if you're not liking the look, you may consider skipping powder altogether.\n\nAdditionally, you only need a small amount of primer for your face (a very thin layer is sufficient... your face should not feel too slippery). Do not apply too much primer. Water-based primers will absorb into your skin better, but silicone-based primers tend to sit on top of it. Using too much will create a slick film that causes your foundation to slide off much sooner. Remember that it is easier to add more (and I recommend that you add more gradually, little by little) than to take primer off of your face. Over time, you'll get used to the amount you need for your face.\n\nWhile pore-filling primers, such as Benefit Porefessional, NYX Pore Filler, and Too Faced Primed and Poreless, are designed specifically to fill in your visible pores, you can also use any primer to do this (though in my experience, they do not do as well at filling in pores as pore-filling primers, and silicone-based primers work best for filling in pores). Just make sure that you tap the primer into your pores rather than rubbing. Tapping gets the product into your pores to fill them in. Rubbing does not do the same (though you can rub afterward to make sure the surface is smoothed out) and will not give you the same pore-filling results.\n\nFinally, please remember that just because you are using two products with the same base, it doesn't necessarily mean that the products will work for you. Not every product works for every person. You may need to experiment to find the right combination for you. I highly recommend asking for samples, as they are a much cheaper (i.e. FREE) method of trying out a product. You can ask for samples of any product that can be sanitized and put in a small sample jar, such as primer and foundation.\n\nI hope this post has been helpful.

    "body": "Du skal bruge en solcreme og der er 445 produkter at vælge imellem, så hvad hulen skal man vælge? Til at løse dette problem har jeg konstrueret et lille program der kan læse ingredienslisterne på Matas hjemmeside og efter lidt manuel oprydning i data er jeg nået frem til en lidt mindre liste og tænkte jeg ville dele mine resultater her.\n\nJeg har været ret striks i mine krav, da jeg er af den opfattelse at solcremer o.l. bør beskytte mod solen og derfor ikke bør indeholde parfume, farve, smag(!?) og lignende skrammel der ikke tilfører nogen værdi.\n\nI alt var der 445 produkter på det tidspunkt jeg hentede data (mindre end 2 uger siden).\n\nAf disse havde 103 ikke opført ingredienser og er derfor ikke med.\n\nAf de resterende havde 135 hormonforstyrende stoffer, mere specifikt er produkter med følgende ingredienser sorteret fra:\n\n* avobenzone\n* octocrylene\n* lavendel\n* benzophenone-3\n* benzyl salicylate\n* bht\n* bha\n* butylparaben\n* methylparaben\n* propylparaben\n* ethylparaben\n* homosalate\n\nAf de resterende 207 produkter havde 73 opført parfume/fragrance/aroma o.l. som vitterligt kan dække over hvad som helst inklusiv skadelige stoffer og er derfor sorteret fra.\n\nAf de resterende 134 produkter havde 2 opført parfume blot under deres kemiske betegnelse, mere specifikt:\n\n* limonene\n* linalool\n* citronellol\n* geraniol\n\nAf de resterende 132 produkter havde 42 opført ingredienser som jeg vil betegne \"problematiske\". Der er ikke helt enighed om de er skadelige eller ej, men jeg valgte at eksludere produkter med:\n\n* sodium lauryl sulfate\n* sodium laureth sulfate\n* methylisothiazoline\n* denatureret alcohol\n* propylene glycol\n* benzyl alcohol\n* benzyl alcohol citral\n* benzyl benzoate\n\nAf de resterende 90 produkter havde 12 farver i. Dvs. enhver ingrediens der starter med CI efterfulgt af et nummer, dog ikke zink og titanium dioxid da de fungerer som solfiltre.\n\nHerefter sorterede jeg alle produkter fra med en SPF værdi mindre end 30 og så er der 66 tilbage fordelt på følgende 4 kategorier sorteret efter billigste pris pr. liter/kg:\n\n**SOLCREMER/OILER:**\n\n|Produkt|Pris pr. liter/kg|Url|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Matas Striber

Er egentlig overrasket over at standardprodukterne fra de store kendte mærker Matas, Derma og Nivea ligger i toppen med denne sortering og man som forbruger egentlig er dækket ret godt ind hvis man ellers holder sig til supermarkedernes hylder.|\n\nEllers vil jeg anbefale appen Kemiluppen der er gratis og kan bruges til at scanne stregkoder på produkter for at se om der er noget man skal være opmærksom på.\n\nOg for de data interesserede er dataene jeg har brugt tilgængelige [her](https://fastupload.io/7392c8bb9f43c703) i OpenOffice format.

På denne tid af året bliver jeg nemt solskoldet, resten af året er det for min huds skyld + jeg bruger hudpleje der gør huden endnu mere sensitiv overfor solen (glykolsyre). \n\nDet mest vigtige for mig er at det er behageligt at bruge, hvis det ikke er det så får jeg det ikke taget på... I den forbindelse er jeg glad for Niveas ansigts solcremer bl.a. deres spf 50 face til sensitive hud (dog er den dårlig under makeup) og dem fra Garnier til ansigtet, de har bl.a. en tyndtflydende solcrememælk der tørrer mat på huden. \n\nJeg har prøvet Matas egen solcreme, men jeg kan slet ikke deres konsistenser! \n\nTil kroppen er enten et apoteksmærke, som f.eks. La Roche Posay, Bioderma, Avene osv. gode og ellers så laver Garnier og Nivea hæderlige solcremer til gode priser. \n\nI forhold til din liste af ingredienser du valgte også at ekskludere, synes jeg især det er interessant at sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, denatured alcohol og propylene glycol er inkluderet. De er alle fire totalt almindelige ingredienser i hudpleje (Dog er sodium lauryl sulfate og sodium laureth sulfate mest almindelige i sæber og renseprodukter) og jeg forstår ikke hvorfor du har skåret dem væk? Denatureret sprit fordamper efter applikation (og kan hjælpe med at solcremen tørrer ind) og ja det kan være udtørrende i nogle formularer, men ved hudpleje er det altid vigtigt at tage højde for formularen og ikke de individuelle ingredienser kun. Du kender jo selv at du kan bruge vand, mel, sukker og æg til at lave en del forskellige opskrifter, hvis du varierer metode og forhold... \n\nPropylene glycol i solcreme kan hjælpe solcremen med at sprede sig bedre på huden og hjælper med at opløse andre ingredienser i solcremen, da det er er godt solvent til mere hydrofobe stoffer. Det eneste jeg ved til kan være problematisk ved propylene alcohol er at det kan være irriterende for huden i høje koncentrationer (50% eller mere), men du vil sjældent se det brugt så koncentreret :p\n\nMichelle Wong, som er kosmetisk kemiker og har en PhD i kemi har skrevet på hendes blog om både [propylene glycol](https://labmuffin.com/what-are-propylene-and-butylene-glycol-and-are-they-safe/) og [SLS](https://labmuffin.com/whats-wrong-with-sls/).",

The scent, made with safe ingredients, is packaged in a handy case resembling the smooth curves and texture of an egg, giving you a pleasant feeling anytime, anywhere.”\n\nhttps://www.tamburins.com/en/item/1695801896/\n\n\nI love eggs so the adorable container is instantly appealing, i love drinking milk tea and it smells like one, i could always use more lip balms, so i decided to get one when i saw it at ICN.\n\n \nBought for USD19 duty-free at ICN airport.\n\n\nMy lips are okay, doesnt get dry or crack often that i need lip balm everyday but they’re nice to layer under my lip colour or gloss.\n\n\nPackaging & Application:\n * Egg-shaped tube, twist up for more product. Comes in a sturdy, fancy box. Great for gifting.\n\n\n * Material & Design:\nEgg container is most likely made out of some plastic material but textured to resemble real eggshell. Imagine the softest sandpaper. No info on website.\n\n\n * Ease of Use:\nOpen cap, apply directly. Twist up the egg for more product.\n\n\n * Portability: It’s a flat little egg and fits in \n the slimmest bags, very handy.\n\n\n * Durability: Sturdy, quality packaging. Use some caution when taking cap off and putting back on. Certain angles may cause the cap to come in contact with the balm. I accidentally scooped a tiny bit of it just now with the cap.\n\n\nIngredients & Formulation:\n * Bis-Behenyl/Isostearyl/Phytosteryl Dimer Dilinoleyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil Dimer Dilinoleate, Phytosteryl/Isostearyl/Cetyl/Stearyl/Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Wax, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Seed Oil, Phytosteryl/Behenyl/Octyldodecyl Lauroyl Glutamate, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Synthetic Wax, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Fragrance(Parfum), Benzyl Alcohol, Linalool, Lecithin, Geraniol, Limonene, Tocopherol\n\n\nManufactured by Cosmax Co. Ltd.\n\n\n * feels oily, smooth and thin upon application- elegant formulation.\n\n\nScent & Flavor:\n\nTop: bergamot, lemon \nMiddle: black tea \nBase: coconut\n\nWebsite:  “based on black tea with a subtle flower smell, this scent brings you the soft scent on the tip of your nose when you drink a glass of black tea with a drop of warm milk, and the warmth gives you the comfort you feel when you take a full rest. Fresh and refreshing bergamot and lemon blend with the bittersweet feeling of black tea, adding layers for daily use. The coconut note adds a soft and sweet finish to the lingering fragrance.”\n\n\nMy thoughts:\n * subtle, pleasant fragrance of milk tea as if you just had a sip.\n * milk tea scent fades away after a while and does mot linger, good if sensitive to smell but still enjoys some fragrance.\n * unscented/unflavored version also available.\n\n\nPerformance & Effectiveness:\n * Immediate Hydration: when used in comparison with my current lip balm from hersteller and lip oil from Sampar addict, this balm is definitely more moisturizing.\n\n\n * Long-Term Hydration: one application lasts 3-4 hours without drinking/eating.\n\n\n * Healing Properties: pretty much immediate relief for chapped lips soon after application.\n\n\n * Protection: tested in a dry, airplane cabin for 7 hours. Held up well and lips remain moisturised upon disembarking.\n\n\n * Overall Comfort: feels pleasantly creamy on the lips and milk tea scent fades over time.\n\n\nLongevity & Value for Money:\n * i dont use lip balms often/everyday, only as needed.\n * Considering the price of USD19 for 5g of product, i dont think this is cost-effective.\n\n\nWho Would This Be Good For?\nGood for you if you find eggs cute, enjoys drinking milk tea,  need a quick relief for chapped lips and most importantly have USD19 laying around for fun money.\n\n\nWould You Repurchase?\n * No WNRP but only because i already bought it once and have the container now. I plan to refill it myself with a cheaper alternative. Would not pay USD19 for another lip balm.\n\n\nOverall Rating:\n * 4 out of 5, would WRP if it was USD9 and not USD19.\n\n\nTL;DR cute lil egg lip balm that smells of delicious milk tea, instant relief for chapped lips but quite pricey at USD19 for 5grams. Fun gift and souvenir.",

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

Any attempts to uplift or invade a non-contacted sentient species was strictly forbidden. The law was created after a species that calls themselves \"Dokori\" had been invaded by the Vrek. Dokori warriors routed the invasion in less than 30 rotations and captured several Vrek vessels. Dokori Pirates are now a direct threat to all the Galactic powers and the Vrek had been unceremoniously eradicated.\"\n\n\"WE ARE NOT THE VREK!\" Echoed throught the hive mind, silencing the sole drone who dared challenge the invasion. \"We will continue. Our plan is perfect, undetectable to the powers of the Galaxy.\" The hive mind explained. \"We are not concerned with the other species. They fear us, call us 'infestation'.\" Another check of the hive mind showed all drones in unanimous agreement. They were unique, no central power structure meant that the hive must be unanimous in order to proceed. Any disagreements were considered by the entirety of the hive. Options and counter options were weighed and discussed before any action was taken. \n\nIn this way, \"the infestation\" as they had been called by several races, seemed to sit idle for hundreds of cycles, only to strike when all had been decided and agreed upon. No Galactic power was safe from the infestation. Their numbers were not even known to them, immune from radiation, no sustenance required except to increase their number. No species, including themselves, remembered where they came from. All anyone knew was that they were nano-biological creatures that could adapt to any environment. \n\n\"Sustenance taken, examining and reproducing.\" \n\nThe hive worked together on everything, it was how they gained sentience, by solving problems through mass participation in the hivemind. The earliest memory was of an almost barren rock containing only bacterial life which had been consumed to create more of the hive. The hive would then stack upon eachother, reinforcing as needed, until a number were no longer effected by the gravity of the rock. No longer restrained, they floated among the stars looking for new rocks that could swell their numbers.\n\n\"Sustinence categorized, complex organism, photosynthetic, carbon 14 based, uncategorized.\" \n\nThis new photosynthetic organism was already being processed for collation. They had categorized millions of photosynthetic organisms already, but it was new, and new information was always exciting to them. Linalool, Eugenol, Methyl Chavicol, this photosynthetic organism was very interesting. Nothing like it had ever been observed by them before. \n\n\"Reproduction complete,\" came thousands of new voices. \"Continuing Sustinence gathering and reproduction. WARNING! MOVEMENT DETECTED! BIPEDAL SENTIENT COMPLEX ORGANISM!\" \n\nThey froze and observed the creature. It was not one of the known sentient species. Many of the characteristics of this species were similar, however none of the categorized sentient species matched this one. \"Filimental cellular structures observed, not covering the epidural layer entirely, only is specific places. Five phalangical digits attached to a singular flexor. Facinating.\" \n\n\"Dagbabbit!\" The creature said. \n\n\"Vocal communication. Similar to most sentients. Expected information.\" \n\n\"Barbara, can you get me the spray bottle? There are mites in the basil.\" \n\n\"Barbara? Vocalize identification? Spray bottle? Mites? Basil?\" The new information was being processed quickly and categorized based on resonance of the vocalization. The vocalization was not among the current known vocalized communications. New space was created in the hivemind by the recently procreate. As their numbers continued to grow on this rock, all the information would be categorized, collated, and stored as with every other rock. \n\n\"Strangest dang mites I ever did see.\" Said the sentient organism while using a lever based liquid delivery system in the general direction of..... \n\n\"IT BURNS!!!!\"\n\nPanic in the hivemind. \"Calm, identify substance immediately and create countermeasures.\" Substances had effected them before, but they were rarely encountered and easily listed. Temperature does not exceed 600°C, not magmatic. Dihydrogen Oxide detected, not a threat. What was burning? \"Multiple acidic compounds detected!\" Not good. \"Deploy alkaline countermeasures!\" \n\n\"Alkalinic substances detected as well\" HOW?!?! Acidic compounds and Alkalinic compounds neutralize each other! How is this possable?!?!\n\n\"Unknown, working!\" Came the hivemind in reply. \n\n\"Well, at least ts not slugs.\" Vocalized the complex bipedal organism. \"A spritz a day keeps the mites and aphids away\". \n\n\"The alkaline substances are bonded directly with the dihydrogen oxide! The acidic components can not neutralize them!\" This attack was horrifying. The hive mind could not comprehend this level of chemical warfare. The entire invasion force was wiped out in less than seven cesium 133 cycles. \"Effective weapon observed, no deterents available.\" The hive mind determined. \"Catagorize this rock for avoidance immediately.\" \n\nJohn and Barbara harvested a small patch of basil and a few cherry tomatoes and began to make an antipasti salad for lunch, completely oblivious to how they had saved humanity completely annihilating \"the infestation\" invasion force. They were also oblivious, as was the rest of humanity, to the cloaked observation station in orbit of the moon known ironically as Phobos. Fear had filled the observers as they intercepted the hive communication from the infestation. They had watched in macabre facination as the consumption of the planet known as Earth was ended immediately with acetic acid and soap mixed with water. \n\nSilence hung on the monitoring room as the realization of every species in attendance left them dumbstruck. The Kavaki was the first to break the impenetrable silence with a squaking \"WHAT IN THE SEVEN HELLS DID I JUST WITNESS?!?!\" \n\n\"Humanity demonstrated an effective weapon against the infestation.\" Commented a Caguttea \"and we watched them make it first hand.\" \n\n\"I suppose we should contact our homeworlds immediately,\" said a Vakeka, still in shock from what they had observed. \"and I would strongly suggest that humanity be uplifted.\" \n\n\"The law...\" The Kavaki began.\n\n\"Hang the law!\" The Vakeka snapped \"A single VAS FOHK human just wiped out the greatest threat to the galaxy!\" \n\nThe observers argued a few moments longer, not about uplifting the humans, but about the best way to proceed. They settled on direct contact with the two humans who had valiantly defended the species, Barbara and John, to begin the process of first contact. The process would also be slow and methodical as well as overly friendly. If humanity could create a weapon of mass destruction of the calibre just witnessed, what other horrors could they unleash? Exceptionally, overly friendly.",

I personally would go for the Be Plain when it's available because it has a simplified formula without the unnecessary plant extracts and flower oils. I think the Be Plain one would be better for oily skin than the Round Lab one. Both of the Hyggee sunscreens look promising, but I'm gravitating towards the Vegan Sun Cream because it is a chemical sunscreen and I have a tan complexion, I don't want to risk a white cast. However, the Real Sun Cream does have an interesting ingredient list and whipped texture (as I can see on Yesstyle)  and I will be looking out for reviews to see whether it leaves a white cast or not and make my decision accordingly. What I love about the Hyggee sunscreens is that they are fragrance/essential oil free, but they still contain alcohol. I prefer alcohol because it allows the sunscreen to set better and be less tacky. If you have oily skin, I would think that one of the Hyggee sunscreens would work better for you because I have a Kolmar sunscreen (Isntree Watery Sun Gel) that is similar to the new Round Lab and Be Plain sunscreens and I definitely wouldn't recommend it for oily skin as it is way too shiny.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that the Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream has beet root extract, which made me think of the Krave Beet Shield. Get this, the Beet Shield was also made in Cosmax, same as this new Hyggee one. So I did some digging and found out that the Beet Shield has the SAME exact 5 filters as this new Hyggee sunscreens in the same order. The rest of ingredients are not too similar though, so I do not think they are the same exact sunscreen, as opposed to how I feel about the Be Plain and Round Lab sunscreens, which I do think are almost identical. I do think this Vegan Sun Cream is inspired by the Beet Shield, with maybe an improved formula, since the Beet Shield did not pass SPF tests. So if you are looking for a replacement of the Krave Beauty Beet Shield but with verified SPF protection, get the new Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream!",

    "body": "⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:** Since making this post, I've learned some new information that has changed my perception and usage of the term \"fungal-safe\". I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️\n\nIt's been over a year since I first made a list of fungal-safe products, for anyone dealing with malassezia follicutlitis (fungal acne), seb derm (seborrheic dermatitis) or similar conditions. Since then, more products have come on the market, reformulations have happened, I've used more products - plus I figured having just a list would be handy reference, since my first post was... really long 😂\n\n[My first list of fungal-safe products](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), with an in-depth guide to how I made my first fungal-safe skincare routine, and practical tips. Notable point is, since that post, I've learned that cetearyl alcohol is not fungal-safe, and switched to using https://folliculitisscout.com as an ingredient checker since I find it up to date, with that ingredient flagged. if any of you want to check if a product is fungal-safe - that's the website I personally use ☺️ If you want a detailed rundown of how and why these ingredients affect our skin, I highly reccomend the SimpleSkincareScience website - [Their Fungal Acne Treatment Bible post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) is very thorough and cites sources ❤️\n\n[My current routine in 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/uwmvkk/my_current_2022_fungalsafe_skincare_routine_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (more or less) with some haircare.\n\nThese are not recommendations, they're just useful information - some products have reviews linked, but please do use ✨️the search bar✨️ as well as other sources to check out other reviews, and make an informed purchase  ☺️\n\n**Disclaimer:** These products are not guaranteed to suit anybody. It's just that ingredients that are known triggers for seb derm or fungal acne - like plant oils, esters, fatty acids, etc. - are absent in these products.

I've mentioned the source of the squalane in these products whenever I've been able to find that info.\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you are dealing with active seb derm/fungal acne and want to be on the safe side, best to avoid products containing mineral oil, liquid paraffin or Vaseline/white petroleum altogether.

    "body": "Some of you might remember me. I was one of the moderators here for half a decade or so until my life got busy enough that it became difficult to keep up.\n\nI have a small fragrance line myself and I occasionally make fragrances for other brands. Occasionally websites like Fragrantica and Now Smell this will write articles about my fragrances. I'm by no means a famous perfumer, but. I've worked enough as a perfumer to have insight into how fragrances are made.\n\nThe average person doesn't really think about what's actually in their fragrances any more than the average person really considers what flavors blend together to make up the taste of cola. (As a side note, you can make a passable cola flavor out of orange, lime cinnamon, lemon, nutmeg and coriander). When people do start thinking about it, they inevitably come across fragrance notes.\n\nFragrance notes are both incredibly useful and completely misleading because NOTES ARE NOT INGREDIENTS! Notes are the impressions that the fragrance creator thinks a lay person might get from smelling the fragrance. They aren't necessarily the ingredients used in the fragrance, and also...this is another important bit...they're not necessarily even what the perfumer was attempting to make the fragrance smell like.\n\nThere's a fundamental misconception on the part of most consumers. Most consumers think that fragrances are made largely from familiar materials. Orange, lemon, jasmine, rose, birch leaves, lily of the valley, etc. Ok, maybe most people realize that most fragrances contain synthetic materials, but there's quite often an implicit assumption that the synthetics are a synthetic version of a natural material...in other words, that the synthetic is an attempt to recreate a smell that is found in nature and that all (or at least most) of the smells in a modern fragrance CAN be reproduced with naturals. I suppose that if you asked someone \"do you think that all synthetics are an attempt to recreate a natural smell?\" they would think about it and quickly come to the conclusion that this doesn't really make sense, but most people haven't actually stopped and thought about it. I see evidence of this assumption all over the place online:\n\n\"I'm looking for all natural version of [fragrance X]\"\n\n\"I'm looking for a less synthetic version of Sauvage\"\n\n\"Can someone tell me which essential oils I can mix together to make an aquatic smell like cool water.\"\n\nIt's really only pretty recently that there's been any real visibility (to the general public) into what materials go into a commercial fragrance so this is an understandable point of view.\n\nIt's very, very wrong though.\n\nWe need to take a giant step back clarify some things.\n\nNatural oils (essential oils/absolute oils/SCO2 extracts/etc) are typically made up of dozens or hundreds of different materials. They're like miniature perfumes in and of themselves with top notes, heart notes and base notes. They're complex and beautiful, but they can only be manipulated in a limited way. They're like photographs.\n\nSpecialty bases are typically made up of dozens of individual ingredients, some natural, some man made, some that exist in nature, some that didn't exist until they were created in a lab in the 60's. Basically, the sky's the limit. You generally don't know exactly what's in them, but they're produced by suppliers that you can be pretty sure will still be making them in 20 years. Sometimes, they're direct attempts to reproduce (or improve upon) a natural smell, for reasons of cost, safety or performance. Sometimes, they're just a novel smell, like Givaudan's aquatic smelling Ultrazur base. These are like computer generated images.\n\nIsolates are ingredients made of a single type of molecule. They can be naturally derived or lab made. They can exist in nature or not. They have names like linalool, coumarin, limonene, ambroxide, methyl dihydrojasmonate and you can describe them typically find the chemical formula for them. A lot of them have trade names that are shorter and refer to one company's version. E.g. Hedione is a trade name for methyl dihydrojasmonate. Quite often isolates can also be found in natural oils.  Natural lavender oil is typically ~42% linalyl actate and ~40% linalool. When composing fragrances, I'll use linalool and linalyl acetate as isolates as well. Sometimes I'll use it them to \"tune\" other ingredients that already contain them, but not in the quantities I want (like lavender). Sometimes I'll use them to add a sweet, floral character to completely unrelated materials. If natural oils are like photographs and bases are like CGI, isolates are like paints. You have the most control, but it takes the most skill to turn them into something beautiful and complex.\n\n\"Aromachemical\" is a catch all term used to describe these fragrant materials, though it typically connotes materials that are either isolates or bases.\n\nNow that we have that out of the way, let's take a look at how commercial fragrances are created.  The easiest way to do that is to take a look at a formula:\n\nCologne accord:\n\nThis is an example formula for a \"cologne\" accord that was composed by Givaudan. It's by no means a finished fragrance, but most everyone would recognize the smell. It's a fresh, slightly sweet, slightly bitter, slightly green smell that often finds its way into men's fresh fragrances in one way or another (though that's not to say that this exact formula does).\n\n* Florhydral - 10\n* Exaltolide Total - 10\n* Ultrazur - 15\n* Peonile - 60\n* Petitgrain oil -70\n* Ethylene Brassylate - 90\n* Aurantiol Pure - 100\n* Geranyl Acetate - 120\n* Linalyl Acetate - 220\n* Dihydro Myrcenol - 305\n\nTotal: 1000\n\nLets take a look at these ingredients one by one:\n\n**Florhydral** is the trade name for an isolate. It is a floralizer that can add a sort of fresh, green, floral note to fragrances. It is not found in nature\n\n**Exaltolide** is another single molecule, a white musk. It's very delicately animalic, with the characteristic smell of a white musk. It's been used as a reference white musk because it's so typical of the \"white musk\" family.\n\n**Ultrazur** is a specialty base from Givaudan. It's marine smelling, more oceanic than the Calone 1951 found in Cool Water. By itself, in concentration, it reminds me very much of fabric softener.\n\n**Peonile** is another \"not found in nature\" molecule. It has a sort of rosy, sort of geraniumlike, sort of peonylikee sort of grapefruitlike oder and acts as a volumizer and fixative. Odor descriptions that call to mind an assortment of known materials are fairly common, but it’s important to note that they don’t mean that it smells like x+y+z. It just means that they have facets that are reminiscent of these materials in some way.\n\n**Petitgrain oil** is a natural oil made from the greenery of a citrus tree. Usually from orange trees, but varieties from mandarin, lemon and all sorts of other citrus are also available.\n\n**Ethylene brassylate** is a sweet, floral, white musk that can smell a touch old fashioned to some people by itself, or in really high concentrations. It’s still a fairly clean musk, however. Yet another single molecule.\n\n**Aurantiol** is a very, very commonly used material in fragrances, particularly men’s fragrances. It’s a single molecule (more or less). Aurantiol is a Schiff Base, which is a class of materials that you get when you combine an aldehyde and an amine and they react with each other. Most amines don’t smell very good, but one of them, something called methyl anthranilate, does. It’s found in white florals, particularly neroli, as well as grapes. Artificial grape flavor is basically methyl anthranilate. Hydroxyitronellal is an aldehyde that is often said to smell as close as any single material does to Lily of the Valley. When they’re mixed together and heated, you get water and a very thick,  highlighter yellow colored schiff base that smells like a more mild version of methyl anthranilate. It’s sweet, long lasting and reminiscent of orange blossom/neroli and grape.\n\n**Geranyl acetate** is the acetate version of geraniol. It’s a single molecule that is literally found in hundreds of natural oils. Everything from oregano and thyme to ylang ylang, rose, geranium and neroli, to fir needle and frankincense. It’s everywhere (much like linalool and linalyl actetate). It’s sweet, fruity-floral, and vaguely green smelling. It also has a smell that I think of as the “acetate smell,” which can make it smell “chemically” to some people in isolation, even though it’s found everywhere in nature.\n\n**Linalyl acetate** is another material like geranyl acetate that’s found all over the place in nature. Natural lavender oil is ~42% linalyl acetate. It’s also found in most of the natural oils I mentioned for geranyl actetate. The description for it is also very similar to geranyl acetate, but it’s more lavendery and less rosy. I really like this material and use it when I was to add an ethereal fruity/floral sweetness to a composition \n\n**Dihydromyrcenol** is aggressively fresh, cold and almost harsh. It’s somewhat reminiscent of citrus and lavender. Mostly, though, it smells like laundry detergent. It was used to scent laundry detergent for years before it made it into fine fragrance. At first it was used in tiny doses, but by the 1980’s is was being used much more prominently. Something like 10% of the formula of Drakkar Noir was dihydromyrcenol. It’s found in trace amounts in nature, but nothing natural really smells prominently of it.\n\nSo now that i’ve explained all the materials, let’s take a look at the formula. Here are some observations:\n\nNatural oils from recognizable sources only make up 7% of the accord. There are other materials that are found in nature, but they’re all isolates, one alien smelling molecule refined from a more familiar smelling material.\nMore than half of the formula is made from 2 molecules. More than 90% Is made from 8.\nThe amounts of materials used can vary wildly. Material strength is in no way consistent.\n\nThe perfumer who composed this formula painted the majority of the formula in broad strokes from single molecule aromachemicals and then filled in depth and details with natural petitgrain oil, and tiny amounts of a specialty base (ultrazur) and a powerful aldehyde (florhydral). \n\nI didn’t compose this, and I can’t speak for the perfumer who did, but I can imagine how it might have been composed. I’ll walk you through my imagining of the perfumer’s process:\n\nI imagine the accord was inspired by the petitgrain, but the perfumer wanted something fresher and more stylized and abstract, in the same way a graphic designer might prefer a stylized logo to a photo.  Dihydromyrcenol is fresh and powerful, but also cold and harsh and almost bitter. It’s a good compliment to petitgrain, but right off the bat, I know it’s not going to be suitable by itself unless i’m trying to just modify the smell of petitgrain a little bit by adding a teeny tiny bit dihydromyrcenol. It needs some cushion, something to cut the harshness. Geranyl acetate and linalyl acetate add a niche cushioning effect, can be used liberally and are both found in petitgrain, so they’ll go well with it. By itself, that composition is still cold and bitter. It needs a bit more warmth, but not a candylike warmth. Something keeping in like with the petitgrain. Aurantiol is the obvious choice. The scent of orange tree leaves go well with the scent of the orange blossoms that nestle amongst them. In keeping with the “more abstract” theme though, we don’t want to just dump neroli or orange blossom absolute into this. Too much complexity can leave a composition smelling muddled, and we want the bitter, fresh, green petitgrain to be the star of the show here, not the neroli. Plus, neroli is quite expensive and not as long lasting as aurantiol. We add the aurantiol for warmth. The peonile for volume and some white musks for depth. It’s pretty common to use multiple musks in a fragrance because many people are anosmic to some musks, so you want to make sure they’re able to smell at least one of them.\n\nThen as finishing touches, we add a hint of Ultrazur, which adds a bit of modern sophistication and florhydral, which in tiny amounts adds a bit of a dewy, natural, green smell to the composition.\n\nThis composition isn’t about taking familiar smells and mixing them together like some sort of fruit salad with hunks of this and hunks of that. It’s about taking an idea and enhancing aspects of it, rebalancing it until it fits the vision. It’s more like painting than making a collage. It’s not necessarily as detailed or accurate, but it’s not supposed to be. Degas wasn’t trying to create photorealistic ballerinas. Van Gogh wasn’t trying to accurately render the night sky. They were trying to evoke an impression. Perfumers are the same way.\n\nIf that fragrance doesn’t smell like realistic rose/jasmine/cedar/etc, chances are, it wasn’t intended to. The perfumer wasn’t trying to make a realistic jasmine and failing, the perfumer was trying to make an entirely new smell that just has aspects that are jasminelike.\n\nBreaking it apart into notes is actually counterproductive in a lot of ways.\n\n...but that’s a subject for another post.",

But seriously, the chemistry of tequila and the blue agave plant is fascinating and I thought I'd draw out a few different versions of a margarita glass. One is just that, a margarita glass filled to the salted rim with some of the molecules found in the plant and in tequila. The second shows the blue agave plant with the margarita glass as the plant's bloom. \n\nTequila's chemistry has a diverse complexity of molecules. Agave sugars, like fructose and glucose, kickstart fermentation, while phenolic compounds such as vanillin and guaiacol offer vanilla and smoky notes. Fusel oils like isoamyl alcohol add fruity complexity, while polyphenols enhance color and potential health benefits. Terpenes like linalool bring floral aromas, while aldehydes like acetaldehyde offer fruity tastes. This intricate environment, enriched by terpenes, aldehydes, and ketones, creates a captivating symphony of flavors, making tequila a captivating blend of science and taste.\n\nHope you enjoy it!\n\nReference: “Quantification of Selected Volatile Constituents and Anions in Mexican Agave Spirits (Tequila, Mezcal, Sotol, Bacanora)” J.

It took much longer than other lists because of all the info I had to gather. That and me rage quitting for a while after computer decided to delete all the ingredient lists I typed out.  :I***\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**General Info (That I got questions about):**\n\n*The reason I typed out some of the ingredient lists is bc I can't find the list in English online that I can easily copy and paste, or the ingredients aren't up to date.*\n\n*I bolded some ingredients that are helpful for skin/skin-identical for healthy skin barrier.*\n\n*The dollar cost is the converted retail price of what it would cost in Korea, without sale/promo.*\n\n*I also looked up all the common plant names from their scientific names because it annoys me when I look at ingredients and I have no idea what that plant is..*\n\n***PEG -*** *something* *means something has been altered or made to be water soluble. It is useful for that but some people avoid it due to microplastics (I don't know a whole lot about it, but have heard people say this).*\n\n[***You don't need to be SUPER DUPER concerned about visible light/blue light protection***](https://labmuffin.com/blue-light-computers-phones-damage-skin/) ***and whatnot, even though some of these products claim to protect against them.***\n\n***TINTED sunscreens are lightly tinted usually in beige or peach color.

As always,* ***YMMV.***\n\n*Many of these companies* ***claim*** *that their product is the* ***gentlest*** *for the most sensitive skin because of EWG (Environmental Working Group) rating of 1, but* ***EWG is NOT a reliable source, especially for sensitive skinned folks***\\*\\*, *as they can be very biased and promote skin-sensitizing things just because an ingredient sounds more \"natural\".\\** ***Natural*** *things usually contain much more possible* ***skin triggers*** *than lab-isolated,* ***single*** *ingredients.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Potentially Irritating Filters (From Lab Muffin Beauty Science Blog)***\n\n>**Avobenzone** is a common irritant and allergen, so it tends to be unsuitable for sensitive skin, and you’re left with inorganic sunscreens only.  \n>  \n>If you’re elsewhere in the world, the newer UVA1 filters aren’t particularly irritating or allergenic.  \n>  \n>A few other organic sunscreens also tend to cause allergic and irritant reactions: **octocrylene, oxybenzone, avobenzone, PABA, Padimate O and enzacamene.**\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SUNSCREEN**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1.\\[A24\\] Premium Sun Protection Cream -

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

I sure hope people are buying it so it doesn't get discontinued. I got it for maybe 6000 KRW for the 50 ml tube and it's such a nice moisturizing vehicle with Tinosorb S and Uvinul A Plus. So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

I use most of these sunscreens in the morning in place of a moisturizer during the spring/summer months, with the exception of the physical sunscreens. During colder weather, I may put a lightweight moisturizer or emulsion underneath.\n\n**Skin Color:** I’m Italian-American with light, olive skin and a neutral undertone. On the Fitzpatrick scale, I fall somewhere between Type 2 and Type 3. Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, & Tinosorb M (along with other hybrid chemical filters) leave a white cast on me. It’s not unbearable, but I’m always on the hunt for a lightweight, affordable AB chemical sunscreen with all newer filters, no alcohol high on the ingredients list, and no hybrid filters. This hasn’t been easy to find, but a few of these have come close.\n\n**What I Look For In A Sunscreen:** My biggest pet peeve is when sunscreen doesn’t dry down and leaves a greasy layer on the skin that my hair sticks to. All the sunscreens on this list dry down really well, and this is coming from someone who applies a lot. (I have a big face in terms of surface area.) I prefer chemical sunscreen with newer filters because the older ones irritate my skin, but I use physical sunscreens occasionally, usually tinted.\n\nThis is going to be a very long, detailed review. Feel free to skip to one you’re interested in!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**List Of Sunscreens From Left To Right:**\n\n1. Dr. Jart Every Sun Day Tone-Up Sun Fluid SPF 50 PA++++\n2. Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Sun Cream SPF 50 PA++++\n3. Botanity Aqua Fit Sun Essence SPF 50 PA++++\n4. Scinic Enjoy Super Mild Sun Essence SPF 50 PA++++\n5. About Me Be Clean Water Sun  SPF 50 PA++++\n6. Borntree Like Ocean Physical Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++\n7. CKD Green Propolis All-Covery Sun SPF 50 PA++++\n8. Naris Up Parasola Brightening UV SPF 50 PA++++\n9. Be Plain Clean Ocean Moisture Sunscreen  SPF 50 PA++++ (not pictured because I finished mine before I decided to write this review lol)\n10. Biore UV Barrier Me Mineral Gentle Milk SPF 50 PA+++ (not pictured for the same reason as above)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1.) Dr. Jart Every Sun Day Tone-Up Sun Fluid SPF 50 PA++++**\n\n**UV Filters:** Uvinal A Plus, Tinosorb S, Parsol SLX, Tinosorb M, Uvinal T 150, Uvasorb HEB, Zinc Oxide & Titanium Dioxide as colorants.\n\n**Manufacturer:** Wasn’t able to find it but if anyone knows, let me know!\n\n**SPF&PA Rating:** SPF 97.9 (+/- 8.5) PA 21.6 (+/- 3.2). Retrieved from [**here**](https://www.qoo10.sg/item/DRJART-BREEZY-DR-JART-NEW-ITEM-EVERY-SUN-DAY-TONE-UP-SUN-FLUID-30ML/492303524?banner_no=1305330), but I’m pretty sure it’s listed on the official Dr. Jart website in Korean, which is hard for me to access.\n\n**Ingredient Call-Out:** No essential oils or fragrances. Contains alcohol on the bottom of the ingredients list. [**Full INCI.** ](https://incidecoder.com/products/dr-jart-every-sun-day-tone-up-sun-fluid-spf50-pa)\n\n**Texture:** Very milky and runny texture – it glides onto the skin very easily, but is also a little greasy\n\n**Finish:** Dewy bordering on shiny\n\n**Pros:** High protection, relatively lightweight sunscreen. It has a slight pink/beige tone to cancel out the white cast, so it’s not as whitening as a traditional “tone-up cream.” Washes off pretty easily, even without an oil cleanser.\n\n**Cons:** It’s not waterproof even in the slightest. When I’m sweaty it becomes this really disgusting, milky texture that you can visibly see on your face. I’ve been trying to use it up while I go on my afternoon walk and I always come back looking really…. bad. It sucks cause it has a lot going for it otherwise and it’s almost usable. Until I start sweating or basically have any contact with water. Could work for you if you don’t sweat that much or just need something for indoors, I guess, but there are better options.\n\n**White Cast**: A little, but not too bad. Eventually sinks in and goes away. Does build with reapplication.\n\n**Eye Sting:** No\n\n**Pilling:** No\n\n**Price/Availability:** I’ve seen this for sale on [**Jolse**](https://jolse.com/product/drjart-every-sun-day-tone-up-sun-fluid-30ml/42829/?cate_no=524&display_group=1) for as cheap as $14-$15. Also available on [**Yesstyle** ](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.USD/coc.US/info.html/pid.1104896166?googtrans=en&utm_source=GoogleAds&utm_campaign=1424525216&utm_term=&utm_content=54841302126_274199995080&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=MIEU1SGQ&mcg=paidsearch&gclid=Cj0KCQjwiNSLBhCPARIsAKNS4_e_C30TLLIeHGVTuSpdN0cRFSNkaYWXqdmmoo-9K98u5ojisi7n7dAaApPeEALw_wcB)and [**Style Korean**](https://www.stylekorean.com/shop/1623981726/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwiNSLBhCPARIsAKNS4_fRb-2dDT3mqE4pvm5id9jHrW4jAPFpMjPUxnPKsiaVAlH29uo7dKAaAjwWEALw_wcB) for $19.40 and $16.00, respectively.\n\n**Overall Rating:** 6/10. Would not repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2.) Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Sun Cream SPF 50 PA++++**\n\n**UV Filters:** Uvinal A Plus, Uvinal T 150, Tinosorb M, Uvasorb HEB.\n\n**Manufacturer:** Kolmar\n\n**SPF&PA Rating**: SPF 55 (+/- 8.5) PA 19.8 (+/- 3.3)\n\n**Ingredient Call-Out:** Chamomile Essential Oil. Contains alcohol on the bottom of the ingredients list. [**Full INCI.** ](https://incidecoder.com/products/round-lab-birch-juice-moisturizing-sun-cream-spf50-pa-2021)\n\n**Texture:** Medium-weight, moisturizing cream. Feels like a regular moisturizer\n\n**Finish**: Dewy/ a little shiny\n\n**Pros:** Can double as a moisturizer and sunscreen in the morning if you don’t feel like you need something really heavy. Pretty lightweight considering the level of protection, doesn’t irritate my face or anything like that. I prefer to use an oil cleanser to take it off because I do feel like it forms a pretty strong film, but that’s what it’s supposed to do!\n\n**Cons:** I like a dewy look, but this could be a little less shiny, in my opinion. If you have oily skin or don’t like looking shiny, you maybe won’t like this. It dries down, so it’s not like a “wet’ greasy look, maybe just a little tacky. This was one of the first newer Korean sunscreens I used after trying a ton of European ones that never sank in and felt like butter on my face, so I was happy enough with it drying down in less than 10 minutes. Now that I’ve used more lightweight sunscreens, it’s still pretty good, but I’ve tried ones that dry down quicker. (More to come later in this list!)\n\n**White Cast:** Makes me look a little lighter than I am upon application, but once the cream sinks in and dries down I don’t really notice it. Does not build up with reapplication\n\n**Eye Sting:** No\n\n**Pilling**: No\n\n**Price/Availability:** Widely available on a ton of websites for around $15-$25, like [**Stylevana,** ](https://www.stylevana.com/en_US/round-lab-birch-juice-moisturizing-sun-cream-50ml.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&sonid=73232&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=10954602384&utm_term=110308360769&utm_content=73232&device=c&gclid=Cj0KCQjwiNSLBhCPARIsAKNS4_csouFR_IOWn-Zb7aquseQN-wNS2zAWtkMdqDrdWsqnCby2Q1T1JwMaAoq4EALw_wcB)[**Olive Young,**](https://global.oliveyoung.com/product/detail?prdtNo=GA210004685&lang=en&gclid=Cj0KCQjwiNSLBhCPARIsAKNS4_eBgVMfLZw1XQ4C5AhqzC5ymEIgTcF06zhBeHbWRbT8cXFYqF9OfmMaAqUpEALw_wcB) and [**Jolse.**](https://jolse.com/product/11-round-lab-birch-juice-moisturizing-sunscreen-spf-50-pa-50ml-2021-re/46258/?cafe_mkt=google_en_dy&gclid=Cj0KCQjwiNSLBhCPARIsAKNS4_fGN4ysQmnGRlRq6KXJg3w8rJAXZQ8P6J44IIHh34lOZES1Pd9rQRcaAui-EALw_wcB) Definitely on the pricier side for sunscreen, which is why I usually only buy it on sale. I’ve gotten it as cheap as $10 per bottle on Jolse, which includes it with 1+1 promotions quite often.\n\n**Overall Rating: 8/10.** Would repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3.) Botanity Aqua Fit Sun Essence SPF 50 PA++++**\n\n**UV Filters:** ​​Uvinul T 150, Meroxyl SX, Uvinul A Plus, Parsol SLX, Tinosorb S\n\n**Manufacturer:** Kolmar\n\n**SPF&PA Rating:** SPF 84. I wasn’t able to find the PA, but I got the SPF information from [**this video** ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k8YIT6Wkuo)by Director Pi. Considering the SPF is pretty high I’m assuming the PA rating is too!\n\n**Ingredient Call-Out:** No essential oils or fragrances. Contains alcohol on the bottom of the ingredients list. [**Full INCI.** ](https://incidecoder.com/products/botanity-aqua-fit-sun-essence-spf-50-pa)\n\n**Texture:** Extremely lightweight gel-like cream, definitely one of the lightest and moistest sunscreens I’ve tried.\n\n**Finish**: Skin-like, natural finish. Maybe a little dewy depending on what you put under, but good for all skin types in my opinion.\n\n**Pros:** One of the lightest chemical sunscreens I’ve tried that doesn’t have alcohol very high on the ingredients list. Moisturizing enough to double as a moisturizer and SPF. It truly goes on like a dream, leaves absolutely no cast or sticky finish, and has no scent. It dries down very fast too. This has been my go-to for vacation as a kind of all-purpose sunscreen.\n\n**Cons:** My only con is I wish it was cheaper & available from more retailers!\n\n**White Cast:** Absolutely no white cast. It goes on completely clear.\n\n**Eye Sting**: No\n\n**Pilling**: No\n\n**Price/Availability:** Unfortunately it’s not very widely available to me in the United States. I’ve purchased it from [**Q10**](https://www.qoo10.sg/item/BOTANITY-AQUA-FIT-SUN-ESSENCE-SPF50-PA-50ML/691357759?banner_no=1305330) for around $17 + shipping. It’s also available on [**eBay**](https://www.ebay.com/itm/265153000250?hash=item3dbc59b33a:g:r-4AAOSwipRgln8G), but very overpriced. If you live in South Korea you may have a better chance of finding it!\n\n**Overall Rating:** 10/10. Would repurchase this one a million times over if I could find it more!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4.) Scinic Enjoy Super Mild Sun Essence SPF 50 PA++++**\n\n**UV Filters**: Uvinal A Plus, Tinosorb S, Parsol SLX, Tinosorb M, Uvinal T 150, Uvasorb HEB.\n\n**Manufacturer:** Cosmecca, according to [**Olive Young.** ](https://global.oliveyoung.com/product/detail?prdtNo=GA210001658&lang=en&gclid=CjwKCAjw0qOIBhBhEiwAyvVcf9qJICfm0Nwuj9xlqsN3YB5wreBGvKTH4GHNjEi_NlCwInpvKIbV8BoCH-cQAvD_BwE#prd-detail-page)\n\n**SPF&PA Rating:** SPF 56.7 (+/- 7.5) PA 23.51 (+/- 2.42)\n\n**Ingredient Call-Out:** No essential oils or fragrances. A previous version contained alcohol, but the newer one doesn’t. [**Full INCI.** ](https://incidecoder.com/products/scinic-enjoy-super-mild-sun-essence-spf50-pa)\n\n**Texture:** Thicker, creamy texture\n\n**Finish:** Dewy, a little shiny\n\n**Pros:** Super high protection, I think probably the highest that’s confirmed out of all the Korean sunscreens on the market right now. Considering the high protection, it’s not too heavy and sinks in pretty well, though it takes a while to work into the skin. Pretty waterproof, definitely requires a double cleanse method. Very cheap and easy to get.\n\n**Cons:** One of the thickest Korean chemical sunscreens I’ve tried so far, more so than others on this list with similar formulas like Round Lab. It’s still leaps and bounds away from any American or European sunscreens in terms of cosmetic elegance, but it takes a little longer to sink in than some others. (Around 10 minutes for me.) If you’re looking for a lightweight SPF that’s similar to watery Japanese sunscreens like Biore, this probably isn’t it.\n\n**White Cast:** Makes me look a little lighter than I am upon application, but once the cream sinks in and dries down I don’t really notice it. It doesn't build up with reapplication.\n\n**Eye Sting:** No\n\n**Pilling**: No\n\n**Price/Availability:** Cheapest sunscreen on this list ($7-$10) and widely available, so it’s usually my go-to if I’m stocking up. I’ve purchased it from [**Yesstyle,**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/scinic-enjoy-super-mild-sun-essence-50ml/info.html/pid.1091552237) [**Stylevana,**](https://www.stylevana.com/en_US/scinic-enjoy-mild-sun-essence-50ml.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&sonid=57802&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=10954602384&utm_term=110308360769&utm_content=57802&device=c&gclid=Cj0KCQjwiNSLBhCPARIsAKNS4_dF4KC8gaL2V89ZEnXtfQHEWC-wH934Q8KMaa5PCLARdV0ncLCfCrQaAnpXEALw_wcB) and [**Olive Young.**](https://global.oliveyoung.com/product/detail?prdtNo=GA210001658&lang=en&gclid=CjwKCAjw0qOIBhBhEiwAyvVcf9qJICfm0Nwuj9xlqsN3YB5wreBGvKTH4GHNjEi_NlCwInpvKIbV8BoCH-cQAvD_BwE#prd-detail-page)\n\n**Overall Rating**: 7.5/10. Would repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5.) About Me Be Clean Water Sun  SPF 50 PA++++**\n\n**UV Filters:** ​​Uvinul T 150, Meroxyl SX, Uvinul A Plus, Parsol SLX, Tinosorb S.\n\n**Manufacturer:** Kolmar\n\n**SPF&PA Rating**: I haven’t actually found the confirmed SPF & PA ratings for this one, but I have faith it’s been tested since it’s from Kolmar, which has been releasing most of the new verified SPFs lately, and has a similar formula to some other SPFs that are verified. Would be nice to know, though, so if anyone has any clue let me know!\n\n**Ingredient Call-Out**: No alcohol, contains Rosemary Essential Oil. [**Full INCI.** ](https://incidecoder.com/products/about-me-be-clean-water-sun-spf50-pa)\n\n**Texture:** VERY lightweight gel/watery texture. Definitely unlike anything else on this list in terms of how thin it is.\n\n**Finish**: Dewy\n\n**Pros**: Very comparable to Biore and other watery Japanese sunscreens. It’s gel-like and glides on so nice, I really love it. And it dries down SO FAST. By the time I’ve walked back to my room from the bathroom, my face is pretty much dry without any tacky finish. It’s really hard to believe alcohol isn’t high up on the ingredients list here, but I’m glad it isn’t!\n\n**Cons:** The smell. If you don’t like the smell of rosemary, you won’t like this. I’m not sensitive to fragrance, and I hate the sickly sweet smell of “parfum.” This one isn’t like that luckily, mostly just a light medicinal smell that goes away after you apply. It sucks because, without the essential oil, it’s pretty much the perfect sunscreen!\n\n**White Cast:** Goes on completely clear, absolutely no white cast.\n\n**Eye Sting**: No\n\n**Pilling**: No\n\n**Price/Availability:** I purchased this from [**Style Korean**](https://www.stylekorean.com/shop/about-me-be-clean-water-sun-spf50-pa-50ml/1622617343/) for $10 on sale. I haven’t been able to find it anywhere else that’s English-speaking, but again maybe someone in South Korea would have better luck.\n\n**Overall Rating**: 9/10. Already planning to repurchase lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6.) Borntree Like Ocean Physical Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++**\n\n**UV Filters**: Zinc Oxide & Titanium Dioxide.\n\n**Manufacturer:** Borntree\n\n**SPF&PA Rating**: SPF & PA is confirmed on a chart on the[ **Borntree**](https://en.borntree.com/product/borntree-like-ocean-physical-sunscreen-50ml/100/#prdDetail) website, but it’s in Korean. Again, if anyone knows, feel free to comment!\n\n**Ingredient Call-Out:** No essential oils, fragrances, or drying alcohols. For a full ingredients list, go to [**Borntree**](https://en.borntree.com/product/borntree-like-ocean-physical-sunscreen-50ml/100/#prdDetail).)\n\n**Texture**: Extremely moist and lightweight for physical sunscreen.\n\n**Finish:** It dries down instantly to a skin-like/matte finish, depending on what I have on underneath.\n\n**Pros:** Amazing finish & dry-down time. I find myself reaching for it most when it’s hot and I really don’t want to feel anything on my face, since it’s basically invisible in terms of residue. Like, not even that slightly moisturized but still dry feeling you get from a chemical sunscreen. It completely sinks in within seconds and I forget I even have sunscreen on. Ideal for under makeup too.\n\n**Cons:** Like all physical sunscreens, I’d say the biggest con is the white cast. It definitely leaves more of a white cast than a chemical sunscreen with Tinosorb M, so deeper skin tones won’t be able to wear this without makeup, I’d say. I’m assuming it has nanoparticles because overall it’s not too bad.\n\n**White Cast:** Slight white cast, despite the pink tint. I don’t really feel like it has any color-correcting abilities, but it’s definitely a tone-up sunscreen. Builds upon reapplication, like most physical sunscreens, but not too bad.\n\n**Eye Sting:** No\n\n**Pilling**: No\n\n**Price/Availability:** I bought it directly from Borntree on [**GMarket**](http://global.gmarket.co.kr/item?goodsCode=1670549121) for $8+ shipping. It’s currently sold out.\n\n**Overall Rating**: 9/10, Would repurchase if I can find it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**7.) CKD Green Propolis All-Covery Sun  SPF 50 PA++++**\n\n**UV Filters:** Zinc Oxide & Titanium Dioxide.\n\n**Manufacturer:** Kolmar\n\n**SPF&PA Rating:**[ **Yesstyle**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/ckd-guaranteed-green-propolis-all-covery-sun-40ml/info.html/pid.1104434534) has a chart with the SPF and PA of this sunscreen, but I can’t read it.\n\n**Ingredient Call-Out:** No drying alcohols. Contains Rosemary & Lavender Essential Oils, plus Linalool. [**Full INCI.** ](https://incidecoder.com/products/c-k-d-green-propolis-all-covery-sun)\n\n**Texture:** Medium weight, relatively dense cream (not runny at all.) It’s not super thick but it doesn’t feel “moist” either.\n\n**Finish:** Dewy/very glowy\n\n**Pros**: This gives the skin SUCH a nice glowy/dewy look. I’m assuming it’s from the propolis, but it’s really different than any sunscreen I’ve tried. It dries down so quickly but still somehow looks dewy without being shiny. It’s also sheer to light coverage and makes my skin look very even, almost like a tinted moisturizer and sunscreen in one. I usually can’t wear physical sunscreens for extended periods of time because I get some dry patches, but I don’t notice any with this one.\n\n**Cons**: Not a universal shade. It only comes in one shade, which leans pretty yellow and is a little light for me personally. It’s kind of hard to compare, but I’d say it’s somewhere between #21 and #23 in typical AB shades. Sometimes I still use it because I like how it looks, so I’ll bronze up my face with other makeup items. It’s definitely perfect for a quick, out-the-door no-makeup makeup look, if the shade matches you.\n\n**White Cast:** Yes, depending on your skin tone (see above)\n\n**Eye Sting:** No\n\n**Pilling:** No\n\n**Price/Availability:** I got this from [**Yesstyle** ](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/ckd-guaranteed-green-propolis-all-covery-sun-40ml/info.html/pid.1104434534)for $15, but it’s also on [**Stylevana**](https://www.stylevana.com/en_US/ckd-green-propolis-all-covery-sun-uv-spf50-pa-40ml.html) and [**Olive Young.** ](https://global.oliveyoung.com/product/detail?prdtNo=GA210711085)\n\n**Overall Rating:** 7/10. Might repurchase\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**8.) Naris Up Parasola Brightening UV SPF 50 PA++++**\n\n**UV Filters:** Zinc Oxide & Titanium Dioxide.\n\n**Manufacturer:** Naris Up\n\n**SPF&PA Rating:** Unknown, but from a well-known Japanese manufacturer, so I’m assuming it’s legit.\n\n**Ingredient Call-Out:** No essential oils, fragrances, or alcohol. [**Full INCI.** ](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/naris-up-parasola-white-brightening-uv-cream-spf-50-pa-30g/info.html/pid.1103749194)\n\n**Texture:** Creamy, medium-weight texture.\n\n**Finish:** Skin-like, natural\n\n**Pros:** Fast dry-down time, though not as fast as the Borntree. It has some interesting ingredients you don’t usually see in sunscreens, like licorice root and tranexamic acid. I’m not sure they’re doing much, but it’s a cool concept!\n\n**Cons**: Somewhat expensive for what you get and not readily available. I know the bottle is a standard 50 ML, but it looks so tiny haha.\n\n**White Cast**: Whereas the Borntree sunscreen I mentioned above has a light pink, almost milky tint, this one is a deeper pink almost purple hue. Somehow, I find it leaves more of a white cast than the Borntree one does, so I find myself reaching for it less, though they’re very similar.\n\n**Eye Sting**: No\n\n**Pilling**: No\n\n**Price/Availability:** Currently sold out on [**Yesstyle,**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/naris-up-parasola-white-brightening-uv-cream-spf-50-pa-30g/info.html/pid.1103749194) though I remember it being around $20. I bought it from [**Kirei Station**](https://www.kireistation.com/product/1605) for $21.\n\n**Overall Rating**: 7/10. Probably won't repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**9.) Be Plain Clean Ocean Moisture Sunscreen  SPF 50 PA++++**\n\n**UV Filters:** Uvinal A Plus, Uvinal T 150, Tinosorb M, Uvasorb HEB\n\n**Manufacturer:** Kolmar\n\n**SPF&PA Rating:** SPF 50, PA 17.28\n\n**Ingredient Call-Out:** No essential oils or fragrances. Contains alcohol on the bottom of the ingredients list. [**Full INCI.** ](https://incidecoder.com/products/be-plain-clean-ocean-moisture-sunscreen)\n\n**Texture:** Medium-weight, moisturizing cream. Feels like a regular moisturizer.\n\n**Finish:** Natural, skin-like finish, maybe a little dewy\n\n**Pros:** If you have oily skin, this is a good alternative to the Round Lab. Though the PA rating is slightly lower, it has pretty similar ingredients, only this one has no essential oil. It also doesn’t leave a shiny finish, unlike the Round Lab.\n\n**Cons:** Probably the price. Unlike the Round Lab, I haven’t been able to find this on sale.\n\n**White Cast:** Makes me look a little lighter than I am upon application, but once the cream sinks in and dries down I don’t really notice it. It doesn't build up with reapplication.\n\n**Eye Sting:** No\n\n**Pilling:** No\n\n**Price/Availability:** I purchased it from[ **Stylevana**](https://www.stylevana.com/en_US/beplain-clean-ocean-moisture-sunscreen-50ml-1.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&sonid=60372&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=12661937173&utm_term=124184221390&utm_content=60372&device=c&gclid=Cj0KCQjwiNSLBhCPARIsAKNS4_d3cTZ9NNNGZFnPau3t6Ox6IASQoErDRqH8xEk67LL9MIx4eMr1D6gaAoqCEALw_wcB) for $20, but it’s also available on[ **Olive Young.** ](https://global.oliveyoung.com/product/detail?prdtNo=GA210510506&lang=en&gclid=Cj0KCQjwiNSLBhCPARIsAKNS4_cXvPk-4KRPNKYupGoayqBh7jhyAuhibN4xgac_u7XZ0hSdfAterLoaAoT5EALw_wcB)\n\n**Overall Rating:** 8/10. Might repurchase if I run out of my Round Lab stash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**10.) Biore UV Barrier Me Mineral Gentle Milk SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**UV Filters:** Zinc Oxide & Titanium Dioxide.\n\n**Manufacturer:** Biore\n\n**SPF&PA Rating:** Unknown, but I trust Biore lol\n\n**Ingredient Call-Out:** No essential oils or alcohol, but contains fragrance. [**Full INCI.** ](https://incidecoder.com/products/biore-uv-barrier-me-mineral-gentle-milk-spf-50-pa)\n\n**Texture:** Very runny, milky texture\n\n**Finish:** Dewy, a little shiny\n\n**Pros:** I picked this up from my local Teso Life, so I appreciate how it’s cheap and readily available in the United States too. It dries down pretty good, though it takes a little while for it to sink in.\n\n**Cons**: The perfume scene is very flowery, it’s not overpowering but definitely not my favorite. It feels a little oily going on, and the white cast is a bit too much for me. It’s almost like a blue-ish white cast. I also wish it was PA++++, and it’s hard to wash off with anything but an oil cleanser.\n\n**White Cast**: Leaves a white cast on me that builds with reapplication.\n\n**Eye Sting**: No\n\n**Pilling**: No\n\n**Price/Availability:** It’s available for $13 on [**Yesstyle**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.USD/coc.US/info.html/pid.1099474927?googtrans=en&utm_source=GoogleAds&utm_campaign=1424525216&utm_term=&utm_content=54082139977_274225508780&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=MIEU1SGQ&mcg=paidsearch&gclid=Cj0KCQjwiNSLBhCPARIsAKNS4_dbC-XSYIsS8c7OoLiwZElRJDPbwamOaRNMgA0aeY3KN9WnJqoEslAaAmkHEALw_wcB) and $10 on [**Stylevana.** ](https://www.stylevana.com/en_US/kao-biore-uv-barrier-me-mineral-gentle-milk-spf-50-pa-japan-version-50ml.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&sonid=77876&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=13433413191&utm_term=122116633566&utm_content=77876&device=c&gclid=Cj0KCQjwiNSLBhCPARIsAKNS4_ef6xanXIU0NMO8zlSHtKfQO5Geb8FDZsAHf42BKBevRWaUaBzAc04aAnaOEALw_wcB)\n\n**Overall Rating**: 6.5/10. Won’t repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sources:** I got most of the SPF/PA ratings either from the official websites or other posts discussed in this group, plus Director Pi's video.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope you found this helpful!

    "body": "This is a continuation of the education pieces I've been posting recently. If you missed them here are the first two:\n\n* [An Example of how Commercial Fragrances are Composed](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/bb3crf/a_example_of_how_commercial_fragrances_are/)\n* [Notes on Notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/bbw310/notes_on_notes_education_long/)\n\nEveryone seems to have a fragrance they love that just doesn’t last. I see online posts all over the place expressing dismay and even anger about how short lived certain fragrances are (“If I pay $200 for a fragrance, it should last all day!”)\n\nThere are an awful lot of ideas about the reasons for why fragrances last as long (or as short) as they do: EdPs last longer than EdTs. God forbid you get an EdC! That smell will be gone before you’re out the door!  I see people saying that higher quality, more expensive fragrances with lots of naturals will last longer. I also see people saying that you have to go with synthetics in order to get good longevity.\n\nIt’s both more simple and more complicated than most people think.\n\nLet’s take few step  back. You smell a fragrance because molecules of it have evaporated into the air and are floating around. When you inhale, the fragrance molecules get sucked into your nose and bump against your scent receptors. The scent receptors send information to your brain about what you’re smelling and, voila! You can smell the bread baking in the kitchen.\n\nThese scent receptors aren’t infinitely sensitive. There has to be a certain concentration of a material in order for your olfactory receptors to register it and for your brain to interpret it as a smell.  That concentration is called the “threshold of detection” and it’s measured in parts per million/billion/trillion. The threshold of detection is different for different materials, often several orders of magnitude different. Geosmin, one of the molecules responsible for petrichor (the after-the-rain smell) is detectable in parts per trillion. A single drop of it in a kilo of fragrance concentrate leaves a prominent smell.\n\nBeyond the threshold of detection is the threshold of identification. This is the concentration at which you can not only determine that there’s something is present, you can identify what it is.\n\nSo one could describe the longevity of a fragrance in technical terms as being the amount of time that some part of it remains in the air in a concentration that exceeds its threshold of detection.\n\nThe second important factor in longevity is the evaporation rate of a particular material, which is determined by the vapor pressure. I mentioned Geosmin earlier as being a material that humans are incredibly sensitive to, but it doesn’t last a long time in fragrances because it evaporates and disperses very quickly. \n\nThe longest lasting materials are the ones that evaporate slowly and that people are good at smelling.\n\nTypically larger molecules evaporate more slowly than smaller molecules. Musks, for example, are very large molecules. On paper test strips, they can last for weeks.\n\nLimonene, on the other hand, is smaller. It evaporates much more quickly, only lasting a few hours on paper.\n\nThere are other factors that affect evaporation rates as well. For example some molecules stick together more than others, making them slower to evaporate. Often the presence of larger molecules slows down the evaporation rate of other, lighter molecules as well. This is what people are referring to when they say that a material is a fixative. Perfumers will quite often use small amounts of materials that are good fixatives, just for this effect (iso E Super and white musks, for example).\n\nHeat is another factor. As a material heats up, it evaporates more quickly. This is why a fragrance that’s seems perfect in cooler weather can seem powerful enough to be cloying as temperatures rise.\n\nSurface area exposed to air is another. A narrow necked bottle with a liter of water in it will evaporate more slowly than a liter of water spread out on the ground in a thin layer. This is one of the reasons that most fragrances have atomizers. A spritz from an atomizer spreads the fragrance out in a nice thin layer over a large area, maximizing the surface area.\n\nFinally, the amount present affects longevity. A drop of water will generally evaporate more quickly than a liter.\n\nI could write much more on this topic (and might at some point in the future), but this should be enough to allow for a discussion about longevity.\n\nOh, actually, there’s one other related topic that doesn’t explicitly affect longevity, but is important to understanding the behavior of a fragrance as it evaporates.\n\nIf you double the concentration of limonene molecules hitting your olfactory receptors, does that make the limonene smell twice as strong? It turns out that it doesn’t. Every material has a different “slope,” or the rate at which perceived intensity increases as concentration increases. The average is somewhere around 1.2. \n\nIn other words, when you double the concentration of a material, it only smells 1.2x as strong, not 2x as strong. This meant that in order to double the perceived intensity of most materials, you’re looking at increasing the concentration by closer to 10x than 2x.\n\nSome materials have an even lower slope than that. When you combine a low slope and a slow evaporation rate, you end up with a  material that seems to have a relatively consistent strength over a long period of time...it doesn’t start out strong and then get weaker quickly. Instead it will often seem to become more prominent over time as the more powerful (but shorter lived) materials burn off. Musks are a good example of this.\n\nSo now, after reading all of this, you should have the understanding needed to discuss fragrance longevity in more practical terms.\n\nThe concentration of a fragrance (the amount of fragrance base in carrier) matters much less than the composition of the fragrance. I’m not go into great detail into the differences between Eau de Cologne, Eau de Toilette, Eau de Parfum and Parfum in this post, but I will point out that the difference between them is not always just the concentration. Quite often, the formula changes as well. When the EdP version lasts a lot longer than the EdT, that’s more likely the result of difference in formulation than it is a difference in concentration.\n\nI often say that concentration is nowhere near as important as people think it is when it comes to longevity. I always get strange looks when I say so because i’m directly contradicting common Internet wisdom. Think about it though:\n\nThe entire reason that alcohol is used as a carrier is that it allows for a fine mist of fragrance oils to be dispersed across the skin...and then it evaporates.\n\nI talked about vapor pressure earlier. Ambrettolide, a very long lasting base note, has a vapor pressure of 0.00016. It lasts on skin for several hours. Linalool, a top note, has a vapor pressure of 0.016. It lasts on skin for about an hour. Ethanol has a vapor pressure of 55 (mmhg@25C, not Kpa). It lasts for a minute or two, then it’s gone.\n\nThere are math equations that you can do to calculate how long it’s going to be before all that ethanol that’s gone. Within a couple minutes it’s just gone.\n\nGo ahead and spray fragrance on your skin. You can watch the ethanol evaporate. \n\nOnce it’s gone, the fragrance you just sprayed on is now at 100% concentration, regardless of whether it started out at 5%, 10%, 15% or 100% when it was in the bottle. \n\nIf you have a bottle of a particular fragrance at 20% and another bottle of the exact same formula at 10% and you do one spray of the first and two of the second over the exact same area, after 5 minutes the fragrance applied will be pretty much the same. \n\nThe amount of ethanol that used to be in a fragrance, back when it came out of the bottle 8 hours ago does not in any way affect the behavior of the pure materials left on your skin 8 hours later. \n\nSo what does?\n\nThe composition of the fragrance. Fragrances with low vapor pressure, low threshold of detection materials will last the longest\nHow much fragrance base you apply (I.e the amount left after the alcohol evaporates). Two sprays of a 10% fragrance will apply more material than one spray of a 15% fragrance. Also, atomizer volume (the amount of material sprayed out in each spray) can affect this.\nOlfactory fatigue.\n\nWe haven’t talked about olfactory fatigue yet. When you constantly smell a smell, you get used to it. Your brain starts to edit it out. You stop smelling it. \n\nSome materials cause olfactory fatigue more quickly than others. And some materials are found all over the place, like, say laundry products. A lot of people are walking around in a constant haze of olfactory fatigue to certain materials. \n\nIt turns out that the laundry industry snatches up just about every material that smells fresh and can survive 45 minutes in hot soapy water followed by an hour in a hot dryer. A lot of people spend 24 hours/day, 7 days a week with cloth that’s soaked in fragrant materials less than a foot away from their nose and then they’re puzzled because a fragrance that’s supposed to last for 8 hours fades after 2, because they already had olfactory fatigue to half the materials that make up the drydown.\n\nAlso, to be frank, a lot of these materials are fairly subtle smelling and a lot of people who do smell them may not even recognize them as being part of that citrus/lavender/geranium melange that they applied several hours ago.\n\nI’ve noticed that the fragrances that are perceived as lasting the longest often tend to get their longevity from materials that people don’t have as much olfactory fatigue to due to laundry products, e.g. vanilla or oud.\n\n**Appendix with some notes:**\n\n**On reformulations with shorter longevity:**\n\nI’ve seen GCMS readouts from a good number of famous, modern fragrance. Without a single exception, every modern fragrance for which i’ve seen a GCMS, from Aventus to Sauvage to Coco Madmoiselle to Eternity has buckets of iso e super, white musks of various sorts and ambroxan. They’re relatively cheap, powerful and pleasant. They’re practically used as a filler. They also last a very, very long time.\n\nI regularly see claims that a supposedly reformulated version of a particular fragrance “smells the same buy only lasts for a couple of hours.” Reformulation paranoia is another subject that i’ll likely touch on later, but even if the fragrance WAS reformulated, quite often the longest lasting ingredients are some of the cheapest. IFRA changes are also often cited as reasons for these supposed reformulations that kill longevity, but these cheap, long lasting materials are generally allowed at very high levels by IFRA. By “very high,” I mean that they could make up 100% of the fragrance base without running afoul of IFRA regulations. \n\nTo be honest, I don’t know where these claims come from, though I have a few suspicions.\n\n**On carriers other than alcohol:**\n\nIf you’re using a fragrance that uses an oil based carrier like fractionated coconut oil, or an oil-like carrier like jojoba, the carrier doesn’t evaporate right away. Instead it stays behind and acts as a fixative. You’ll likely get better longevity but a more muted odor.\n\n**On using Iso E Super to make fragrances last longer:**\n\nYour fragrance is probably already drenched in Iso E Super. It’s a really, really inexpensive material. The perfumer didn’t add more of it for a reason. When you use too much it can make everything else smell flat and muted. Will it make the fragrance last longer? Maybe, but not that much longer. There’s already probably enough in there to get a good fixative effect.\n\n**On whether natural materials last longer than synthetics:**\n\nSome naturals last a long time. Most of the time, we can synthesize most of the molecules that make up these materials in a lab. Synthetics can also include all sorts of other stuff too though. I can think of materials for which the natural version smells better (deeper/richer/more complex), but I can’t think of any where the natural outlasts the synthetic. I can, however, think of plenty of materials for which there is a longer lasting synthetic version.\n\nThe type of fragrance being made (e.g. a heavy oriental vs. a citrus floral) typically has a lot more to do with longevity than whether it’s made mostly from synthetics or naturals, but if you’re using both you have a wider palette to work from and more choices for long lasting materials at each step along the way.",

I'm asking because it's much easier for me to get to know the transitions of the fragrance on paper.\n2.

Most products that claim to mend split ends don’t have these two ingredients. Also, both ingredients are required for the mending to work and withstand other stresses like combing. \n\n#Here’s the study done on these two ingredients showing the semi permanent mending effects: \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/6111412_Semi-permanent_split_end_mending_with_a_polyelectrolyte_complex\n\n##Brief explanation:\n\nThe cationic, anti static ingredient **polyquaternium-28** is attracted to the anionic ingredient **PVM/MA copolymer**. The idea is that damage and split ends are anionic so the polyquaternium-28 is attracted to them and will bind them together until it is washed out. In the study, these two ingredients were shown to bind together split ends and also withstood the stress of combing.\n\n#Here are some products I FINALLY found that have these two ingredients:\n\n#[Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum 4 oz ($20)](https://www.frendsbeauty.com/kim-kimble-healed-ends-serum-4oz.html)\n\nIngredients: \n\nWater (Aqua), **Polyquaternium-28**, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Arctium Majus Root (Burdock) Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail Extract, Malva Sylvestris (Mallow) Flower Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Saccharum Officinaru (Sugarcane) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Lactic Acid, Ethylhexyglycerin, Betaine, Hexylene Glycol, **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Dimethicone PEG-8 Meadowfoamate, Hexapeptide-11, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nThis one has **polyquaternium-28** as the 2nd ingredient, then some oils, a bunch of extracts, then the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 17th ingredient. Phenoxyethanol as the preservative is fine here since it is being used on the ends, not on the scalp.\n\n#[Color Proof SuperRich Split Ends Mender 3.4 oz ($11)](https://www.beautyplussalon.com/color-proof-superrich-split-ends-mender)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Glycerin, **Polyquaternium-28**, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, Fragrance (Parfum), **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Polysorbate 80, Caprylyl Glycol, Linalool, Citric Acid, Limonene, Sorbitan Oleate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Citronellol, Citral, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Quaternium-95, Propanediol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Extract, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Hydrolyzed Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Lentinus Edodes Extract, Tocopherol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Benzoate, BHT, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate.\n\nThis ingredients list is interesting, **polyquaternium-28** as the 3rd ingredient is awesome, but the 4th, 5th, and 6th ingredients are two preservatives and a fragrance. That’s fine, as xanthan gum is also a thickener. Then the 7th ingredient is the **PVM/MA copolymer**. Then there’s a bunch of emollients and extracts and another preservative that is annoying to see in products. \n\n##This one contains Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, a **formaldehyde releasing preservative**. This is fine, as the formaldehyde is how it preserves the product, but it is always good to be aware of these things, so you don’t let the bottle sit for a very long time, as this ingredient **releases formaldehyde slowly over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[White Sands The Cure 24/7 Serum 3.38 oz ($20)](https://sleekshop.com/products/white-sands-the-cure-24-7-serum.html?sku=whs09-3-38-oz)\n\nIngredients:\n\nDeionized Water, **Polyaualerium-28**, **PVMMA Copolymer**, Xanthan Gum, Caprylic/Capric Acid, Triglyceride, Cyrribidium Grandilorioum Flower, Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate, Fragrance.\n\nThis one has a much more simple ingredients list! **Polyquaternium-28** is the second ingredient and the **PVM/MA** copolymer is the third ingredient. Then there is xanthan gum to thicken and preserve. \n\n##However, again, at the end of this list we have **formaldehyde releasing preservatives**: **Diazolidinyl Urea and Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate.** Again, this is fine, but good to be aware of so you don’t let the bottle sit for a year, as these preservatives **slowly release formaldehyde over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[OGX Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream 6 oz ($9)](https://www.ulta.com/p/locking-coconut-curls-air-dry-cream-pimprod2005306)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater (Aqua), Tapioca Starch, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Polyquaternium-37, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Polyquaternium-28**, **PVM/VA Copolymer**, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Lecithin, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nHere we have tapioca starch to reduce any heavy oily feel. Then some emollients and oils. Then **polyquaternium-28** as the 7th ingredient and the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 8th ingredient. Then there’s some more emollients and then the preservative and a fragrance. Phenoxyethanol is a fine because this is for use on the end of the hair, not the scalp. \n\nSo there you have it. You can semi-permanently mend your split ends. It took a LONG time for me to find products that actually had the *combitnation* of BOTH of these ingredients. \n#So if anyone else finds more products that contain polyquaternium-28 and PVM/MA copolymer, please share here!\n\nAlso, for those that can’t tell, the links are imbedded in the title of the product. So, for example, you can click on the title Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum at the top of the post and it will take you to the website. The links are imbedded in every title",

I'm just going to do a very quick overview here:\n\n- **Lavender**: Reduces anxiety, oral supplementation with 40-80mg of the oil appears effective for GAD based on two well controlled but still preliminary studies and there is a magnitude of aromatherapy research (meh, take the quality for what you want) suggesting it is effective for anxiety there. We do, however, have one study in rats noting that the aroma molecule (linalool) was detected in the blood following exposure to the aroma, so I use that as a *suck it* to anybody who says there is no physical basis for aromatherapy\n\n- **Hemp protein**: No evidence to say it is better than whey protein (Rogan?) and it has a nice fiber content. I have been warned it tastes like ass and a texture of what comes out of it after psyllium ingestion\n\n- **Psyllium**: This will make you poop the fountain of youth and reincarnate corpses because your poops are so soft and passable while also being bigger. It might also reduce flatulence while being healthy, you can just use metamucil if you want it flavored\n\n- **Nattokinase** oh honey no... (just eat natto)\n\n- **Coconut oil**: This one is pretty cool, there is indeed evidence that replacing other fatty acids in your diet with coconut oil increases the rate of fat loss and this may be secondary to being slightly thermogenic and/or creating ketone bodies. That being said, it isn't magically potent by any means\n\n- **Noopept** is indeed piracetam 2.0 but is equally unsupported in otherwise healthy humans for the purpose of cognitive enhancement. Nice for brain damage though?\n\n- **7-keto DHEA** it has really cool mechanisms and is great mind candy but I cannot say there is enough evidence to support its usage. If you want to get it anyways because of the phrase \"reduces the rate of which your metabolic rate lowers during dieting\" then go right ahead. I look forward to future research on 7-keto and neurology though, shits interesting and might be anti-PMS, anti-addicting, and a cognitive enhancer!\n\n- **Nitrate** and beetroot are beta-alanine 2.0; if you crossfit, snort lines of these and if you do endurance exercises like cycling or running *consider* snorting lines of them. Seriously, these are pseudovitamin-ish-kinda-maybe and are cardioprotective, increasing nitric oxide by means that citrulline/arginine do not and are possible additive. Definitely consider making a beetroot smoothie or using nitrates for preworkout or for reducing blood pressure\n\nNote: do not actually snort nitrates, things might explode\n\nAlso, nitrates do not increase acute power output... sorry powerlifters (they might help during GPP or some hypertrophy work?)",

    "body": "ETA: I am NOT advocating trying these methods without consulting a medical professional. PLEASE SPEAK WITH A PROFESSIONAL FIRST. This is important because a) what you think is hormonal acne may not be hormonal acne, in which case an androgen inhibitor can mess you up, and b) there may be an underlying cause for your hormonal imbalance that needs to be addressed. Thanks to /u/satisphoria for suggesting this edit. Please please do not try things that can mess with your hormones without talking to a doctor first. \n\nI've been seeing lots of posts lately asking for hormonal acne help (and I myself am a hormonal acne sufferer!), so I decided to do some research tonight. \n\n**Causes of hormonal acne**\n\nFor those who haven't done the research yet, read here! Others feel free to skip on to the next section.\n\nAccording to [the American Academy of Dermatology](https://www.aad.org/media/news-releases/hormonal-factors-key-to-understanding-acne-in-women), hormones influence excess sebum production (yech). This means that skin cells that shred can become \"abnormally sticky\" and clog up your hair follicles. That explains a lot to me (like why the \"beard\" area tends to be a prime place for hormonal acne to pop up). There can also be an excess of the *P. Acnes* bacteria being produced, and skin inflammation can increase. \n\nTo dive deeper into this, the source says that androgens play a role in this by overstimulating the oil glands. So what exactly are androgens, and why on earth do they do these nasty things to our skin?\n\n**Androgens**\n\nThere are two main androgens we should be concerned with here. I found a sample from a [lovely article on PubMed](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0625.2004.00255.x/epdf?r3_referer=wol&tracking_action=preview_click&show_checkout=1&purchase_referrer=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&purchase_site_license=LICENSE_DENIED_NO_CUSTOMER) that tells me they are called dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S from now on because goddang if that isn't a keyboardful) and androstenedione. The first thing that stands out to me, even just looking at the names, is that one of them is a sulfate. I remember that in the last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4pr2yz/hormonal_outbreak_how_do_you_change_your_routine/) I saw on hormonal acne, /u/zhene said that a sulfate-free toothpaste was helpful when managing hormonal outbreaks. Of course, YMMV applies here, but my brain immediately lightbulbed. Reading further down the PubMed article, I see why: \"DHEA-S is the androgen with by far the highest serum concentration in both sexes and is considered to be the most important regulator of sebum secretion\". Of course, my sample chops off after that point, but hey, that was useful. Connecting these two sources together, it seems as though DHEA-S could be the culprit of the overproduction of sebum and thus the acne. A factoid that I found: [this article](http://www.whitelotusclinic.ca/blog/dr-fiona-nd/high_dhea_testosterone_pcos/) says that a higher level of DHEA-S is one of the markers for PCOS. As I'm sure many of you know, one of the symptoms of PCOS (among others such as hirsutism and the string of pearls cysts on the ovaries) is hormonal acne. \n\nSo what I'm getting out of this: to help control your hormonal acne, you really need to have something that will control/inhibit the production of DHEA-S in particular, or something that's REALLY REALLY GOOD at controlling excess sebum production.\n\n**Spearmint**\n\nThe first thing I thought I'd look into was spearmint. Lots of people swear by spearmint tea or spearmint capsules when they give advice on hormonal acne. However, I am the absolute worst. Translation: I hate drinking tea and taking pills. So I thought, what about using spearmint topically? Here's what I found out:\n\nI got some information from [Essential Oil Informer](http://essentialoilsinformer.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-spearmint-oil/). It uses some credible sources to back up its claims, like the Journal of Microbiology Research, so I'm inclined to say that this particular article is reliable. I did sleuth that journal to back up the claims they are making, and they're all in an [article I found there](http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.j.microbiology.20110101.01.html). \n\nIt looks like the components of spearmint essential oil are \"Alpha Pinene, Beta Pinene, Carvone, Cineole, Caryophyllene, Linalool, Limonene, Menthol and Myrcene\". I'm over here like, mmm, menthol. Sounds cooling and soothing. Sounds promising-ish. Next up, the bacteria it is useful in combating: \"Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Pasturella multocida\". The fungal pathogens it's useful in combating: \"Aspergillus niger, Mucor mucedo, Fusarium solani, Botryodiplodia theobromae, and Rhizopus solani\". \n\nSo this is lovely. The articles I found say that the \"active\" components of spearmint oil are the carvone and limonene. These would then be the things that have anti-androgenic qualities, if spearmint can be proven to really be anti-androgenic. There have been studies, of course, which point in that direction (namely [one in Turkey](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17310494)), but they don't really seem to come to the conclusion that spearmint is definitely anti-androgenic - only that it might be.\n\nSo that's all well and good, but all these studies are conducted with people actually ingesting spearmint, usually through tea or capsules. But for those who don't want to ingest it, can you use it topically? My research was pretty inconclusive. The most I was able to find was a thread on a message board for PCOS where someone tried [rubbing spearmint tea leaves on their chest](http://www.soulcysters.net/showthread.php/291429-spearmint-tea-experimental!) (you'll have to scroll down a bit or ctrl+f for \"topical\" to find the start of the comments about it) and then rubbing the spearmint essential oil on their chest afterwards (OH MY GOD NONONONO) to see if it helped. They did say that the hairs on their chest lightened and some that were plucked did not grow back, and thankfully discontinued rubbing the essential oil straight on their skin and went back to the tea leaves. Yikes. Speaking of which, obviously you shouldn't go rub this oil right on your skin. Much like tea tree oil, it's much too strong to use straight, you should use a carrier oil if you want to put it on your skin.\n\nIn conclusion: can spearmint essential oil be used topically to help combat your hormonal acne? The answer seems to be a resounding maybe. Since DHEA-S is produced in the adrenal glands and synthesized in the skin, I'm not sure if a topical application of spearmint oil would be \"too late\" to really block the androgen and therefore stop it from messing with sebum production when it's overproduced.\n\n**Evening Primrose Oil**\n\nOkay, y'all still with me? I know that was a pretty long rant on spearmint to end up with \"idk lol\" but I at least feel like I've got a better understanding of where it needs to be working now.\n\nSo, on to evening primrose oil. It can have [some side effects](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/eveningprimrose#cautions) when you ingest it, though this article says that many people tolerate it well in the short term. But we're talking topical here!\n\nThe first thing that jumped out to me as an \"oh hell no\" about using this stuff topically is that it goes rancid REALLY quickly, even when refrigerated. Almost every article I opened up about the stuff basically says \"not worth it, it goes rancid fast.\" However, according to Truth in Aging, it does seem to [dilute sebum production](https://www.truthinaging.com/review/what-is-it-evening-primrose-oil), which is totally what we're going for. Apparently it goes rancid quickly due to its high concentration of saturated fats. So, while it seems like it is possible to treat acne through topical use of evening primrose oil, it's much less practical than taking supplements, and you need to be careful to make sure that there's enough of a concentration of the oil to be effective.\n\nMy rant on evening primrose oil is a bit shorter than the rant on spearmint oil. I'd like to confine myself to \"is this stuff effective topically\" here just to keep the post to a reasonable length. (Actually what is reasonable though, this got way longer than I thought it was going to.) I wanted to include lots more research on how I got to my \"conclusion\" on topical spearmint oil so that I could show that I researched the crap out of it and still found very little that was conclusive. Plus I had to do a lot more piecing together of sources on spearmint than on evening primrose. \n\n**TL;DR:** Topical spearmint oil is a maybe. It's a real androgen blocker, so by the time the androgens actually get to your skin, it may be too late for the spearmint to actually block it. Topical evening primrose oil is a preference. It dilutes sebum instead of blocking androgens, so it's plausible to use it topically, but it goes rancid pretty fast. It may be more plausible to take it as a supplement, but for those who can't/don't want to take pills, you can use the oil on your skin if you're okay with the oil itself dying pretty quickly.\n\nHope this was useful to some people!",

Androgens, which include testosterone, are what we call \"male hormones,\" in the same way that we call estrogens \"female hormones.\" It's more complicated than that, since (for one thing) everyone needs to have a balance of both, but in general if you have more androgens than estrogens in your system, you're probably a dude, and if more estrogens, vice-versa.\n\n* PCOS, the most common cause of chronic hormonal acne in adults, is basically when you have ovaries but they're not working right, and you have higher androgen levels than you should. (Not necessarily lower estrogen levels; they might be low, or they might be normal, or high.) People with PCOS often have acne that's most heavy along the jawline, where a beard would grow. Depending on the severity of the hormonal imbalance and how long it persists, you may also grow an actual beard, as well as unusually heavy hair elsewhere on your body. Irregular and unusually painful periods are also common, as are weight gain, diabetes, depression, fatigue, infertility, random stabby pelvic pain, and assorted unpleasant vagina problems like vaginismus or a microperforate/imperforate hymen. (The easiest way to explain the symptoms of PCOS is: imagine if your body can't decide if you're pregnant, or a 16-year-old boy.)\n\n* (Despite what some people think, infertility is not a constant here - it's a common symptom, yeah, but most people with PCOS are able to become pregnant without medical intervention. Having conceived easily doesn't mean that you can't have PCOS, and having PCOS doesn't mean that you don't need birth control.)\n\n* The surfactant-type cleansing sulfates found in toothpaste have literally nothing to do with DHEA-S. The fact that \"sulfate\" is in the name of both is irrelevant: they're totally unrelated substances. \"Zinc oxide\" and \"nitrous oxide\" both end with \"oxide,\" but most physicians advise against using laughing gas as a sunscreen, or Banana Boat as an anesthetic.\n\n* People with PCOS tend to have higher-than-average levels of DHEA-S because DHEA-S is an androgen, and, like I said before, we have elevated androgen levels. Elevated androgen levels cannot be lowered by avoiding sulfate surfactants. If they could, my symptoms would have improved back when I was being a mega-hippie and using baking soda and vinegar for everything.\n\n* Some people do get skin problems from products with sulfates, but that's not a hormone thing. Surfactant-type sulfates are, y'know, surfactants, and surfactants are irritating in general; plus, some people are sensitive to specific sulfates. This is not an under-studied phenomenon.\n\n* Also, sulfate-free toothpastes often have less fluoride than other varieties, and fluoride itself can be irritating to people with sensitive skin or gums. So, the sulfates may not even be what was bothering the particular Reddit user upon whom the OP chose to base the \"sulfates mess up your hormones\" hypothesis.\n\n* Hormonal imbalances are very, very complicated. Trying to find one single hormone to blame for your problems makes as much sense as trying to find one single guy to blame for the crime rate in Florida. Which is to say that it makes no sense. Florida Man is not a real person. I'm sorry; I hope you didn't pay too much for that autograph?\n\n* Whether or not spearmint oil has any antibacterial effects is irrelevant to its usefulness as an androgen blocker, because hormones are not bacteria.\n\n* \"The articles I found say that the \"active\" components of spearmint oil are the carvone and limonene. These would then be the things that have anti-androgenic qualities, if spearmint can be proven to really be anti-androgenic.\" This is 1) not what \"active\" means and 2) completely false. We have no idea yet what substance-or-group-of-substances in spearmint seems to be acting as an androgen blocker.\n\n* It's unlikely to be limonene, though, given that someone would probbbbbbably have noticed by now if literally all citrus fruits were potent androgen blockers.\n\n* \"News At Six: Oranges Cause Impotence And Infertility In Men, Dang How Did Humanity Fail To Notice This For Thousands Of Years\"\n\n* There have in been no long-term studies on the safety of consuming large quantities of spearmint daily. For all we know some combination of ingredients in spearmint will gradually cause liver damage, if permitted to build up. Menthol can definitely be toxic in high enough concentrations; hypothetically, suppose that something else in there kept it from metabolizing, allowing it to build up to a toxic dose?\n\n* If this seems unlikely, keep in mind that black pepper and grapefruit contain ingredients capable of doing this to a number of relatively innocuous medications. I've personally made myself pretty sick with black pepper extract! Fun times.\n\n* Even aside from the lack of toxicity data, we *already know* that taking large doses of spearmint regularly can be dangerous: something in it is a strong diuretic, which means that it can make you dehydrated, make your blood pressure drop sharply, and potentially cause you to pass out. (It seems plausible to me that this something is the same thing that seems to be acting as an androgen blocker; the most popular androgen-blocking medication for PCOS, spironolactone, is also a strong diuretic, and it tastes like spearmint.)\n\n* When you're taking a normal diuretic like spiro, you can compensate by drinking more water and eating more salt and/or sugar. You won't necessarily be able to compensate *easily,* because for a lot of people (including me) it takes substantial effort, but it's at least possible. But because spearmint supplements are not standardized to keep the amount of this diuretic ingredient the same in each pill/teabag/dropperful, you never know how much of it you're getting, meaning that you never know how much water/salt/sugar you need to compensate with to stay safe. You might be fine for the course of one bottle of capsules, then get a new bottle from the same manufacturer and pass out driving to work.\n\n* If a plant has the same effects as a prescription medication, and you're wary the prescription medication, you should always be even more wary of the plant. You know what's in the pill because it's on the label. Plants, however, do not have ingredients lists - their chemical composition varies with the varietal, the weather, the soil, the water and air quality, and dozens of other factors.\n\n* If you think that you have a hormone imbalance, please talk to a doctor if you can possibly do so.",

        "body": "Interesting post. /u/satisphora makes a very good point about not trying to treat a suspected hormonal imbalance without discussing with a medical professional. For women there are several hormones that control fertility and by focusing on one of them i.e. by drinking spearmint tea, it can actually end up knocking other hormones out of balance making the problem worse. (Not a very scientific explanation but you get the point). Hormonal acne is a b!tch and is still not properly understood due to a lack of research/evidence in this area. As a result a lot of doctors and derms still tend to use the retinoid/birth control approach which I don't think actually addresses the root cause of the hormonal imbalance. I suspect lack of research is due to lack of funding if the big drug companies can't make any money out of it!",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae](https://preview.redd.it/04x8cx1jvsy81.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db29ff28ad9fbcd3ff56a158d60e872ed63cb538)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco.

I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( .

I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\nand that's all from my side! I know its not much but then again kangaal haalaat mein kharidaari mushkil hai 💀. anyway, here's a list ss that I do want to try once this lot is finished:\n\n* sunscoop sunscreen serum (only if dermaco doesnt work lmao. really intrigued)\n* Face shop sunscreens (itne variants . ek try karne ka mann hai 😖)\n* beauty of joseon rice ss (stock mein aaja bhai 😫)\n* missha sun aqua gel and essence (bas aise hi lol)\n\nI've also tried the neutrogena ultra sheer, episoft , a few banana boat ones but way long ago so I don't clearly remember them to give the verdict on them. just if I haven't repurchased them, consider that they didn't work well for me.\n\nhope this was informational and you guys enjoyed! if you still have any other questions related to the product above, feel free to comment!",

    "body": "To me, price tag doesnt matter. Its whats INSIDE that matters. and i feel like i see a lot of people ignore the ingredients of their skincare and are getting scammed. on both the low dollar tree end and and the high end.\n\nNow i am not one to be scared of anything with a scientific name like Hydrogen oxide or call everything 'Chemicals'. But if a product claims to have a certain ingredient and its the LAST thing on the list under even fragrance and preservatives, i have questions. Or for what ingredients they claim to have they then package improperly like Vitamin C and Retinal in clear bottles.\n\nSome brands at the DT have proven time and time again to just not use enough of an active they claim they have in a product and its just a waste of my $1.25 (im looking at you BOLERO) while others have shockingly good ingredients like skin nutrition botanicals.\n\nAs a long time DT lover, this newer brand BPure is giving me Bolero vibes with some of their products, and thats an insult.... For example the new glow up serums. I took a look at the ingredients and they just dont line up with the claims on the package.\n\nHere are the ingredients for the strawberry one:\n\nWATER, GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, PEG/PPG-17/6 COPOLYMER, POLYSORBATE 80, HYDROXYACETOPHENONE, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, CARBOMER, SODIUM ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, ISOHEXADEC- ANE, NIACINAMIDE, CAPRYLHY-DROXAMIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, DISODIUM EDTA. FRAGRANCE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, SODIUM HYALURONATE. SALICYLIC ACID, ACACIA SENEGAL GUM. LINALOOL, FRAGARIA ANANASSA (STRAWBERRY) FRUIT EXTRACT, CITRIC ACID, CARMINE (CI 75470)\n\nThis claims to have AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) and just just does not. it has citric acid which is technically an AHA, but its at the end of the list and in that amount is not doing anything. and the strawberry extract can be considered a 'natural aha' but again, thats not the claims and its so low it wont work like an AHA.\n\nHaving most the actives listed under fragrance means its likely under 1%. The Salicylic acid has to be like 1-2% to work. At MOST this serum is hydrating. but a very basic hydration at that. Which isnt bad, but not what it claims at ALL.\n\nBut then there are brands like skin nutrition and their claims on their products and the ingredients are actually shocking. The actives they claim are there in their true form (not like the AHA lie in the last one). They have correct percentages (and often TELL YOU the % for a lot of things). While they might not be the most life changing product, based on formula alone, they weirdly outclass a lot of brands and their claims for $1.25\n\nWhile i enjoy trying all the new products that come out, when i see items like the BPure strawberry smoothing serum, i get frustrated. They clearly can make and sell quality products like skin nutrition. It feels like they have started to pump out poor performing products that probably have a better profit margin since they dont contain very much of the more expensive ingredients and its \"just a $1.25\" so people scoop them all up since its viral.\n\nIs anyone else seeing this with recent launches? And BPure has put out some great products too, but they are so hit or miss with their claims and how they line up with whats in them. Just because i shop at DT doesnt mean i want to over consume. and i know its easy to just try everything, but it adds up. \n\nwhat viral DT beauty products have you noticed like this? what are your thought on this? Do you just trust what the product is claiming? What are your thoughts?\n\n",

        "body": "Buying DT beauty/skincare is  an option for those who enjoy frequently trying new products, love to experiment, and prefer an inexpensive/budget shopping experience. Over the years I have tried some DT products but have left behind most I had initially considered.  Because after checking the ingredient list, I have concluded that many  products simply won’t meet my needs. Fragrance, niacinamide, floral/fruit extracts are a no. Instead I stick to the OG skincare/haircare/cosmetic products that have never disappointed and I know work for my skin.  I just buy these on sale, stack my coupons, use store promotions and CVS ExtraBucks to restock the products I have already learned work best. For example, a bar of Vanicream soap might be as low as $4 after coupons and promotions. A Maybelline mascara might cost $5. That’s the same cost as four DT products at the current 1.25 price point.  Sure, I could buy 4 DT mascaras for that same $5, but they likely won’t be as effective or as consistent as a Maybelline product. However, if I saw my favorite Maybelline mascara at DT I would certainly buy at least two!\n\nWe can choose how to consume and we can all become smarter consumers. If an active ingredient is dead last or very far down the list, there’s a good chance that ingredient has such a low percentage that it will not produce appreciable results.\n\nAn educated DT consumer is a happier consumer. ❤️",

        "body": "I agree with a lot of what you have said. I think that those specific watermelon, strawberry, Avocado, etc. bpure serums are sort of useless and definitely unnecessary. Not Worth even your $1.25. And so I totally agree with that. \n\nI also agree that there are definitely products that don't have amounts of ingredients that are even going to be effective just like you said. That being said, I think a lot of people hear \"Dollar Tree\" and think, there's no way there's anything good in there or anything in an amount that's effective, which just isn't necessarily true at all. And so I'm glad that you also mentioned a couple brands that are doing good things cause I actually think there are several brands that have extremely effective combinations additionally. \n\nOne thing I thought would be important to point out for those who aren't as adept at ingredient list reading, It isn't always just about how high up in the ingredient list the ingredient is. Some things just have to come in very small percentages for the best situation for your skin. People think they want retinol to be the second ingredient, but we don't usually want like a huge percentage of retinol or something else. AND sometimes a large amount of retinol isn't even helpful if it's not actually being delivered into the skin with proper mechanisms. So an amount of retinol or Vitamin C or whatever underneath 1% could still be effective depending on the situation. \n\nThe whole vitamin C thing is super complicated as well because there's different types of vitamin C that require different percentages to be effective. And also it's just a not a very stable ingredient and so there's a lot of confusion there. \n\nHowever, that being said, I don't think we should write off all clear bottles that have what we consider sun sensitive ingredients like retinol. Studies have shown that while some ingredients prone to deteriorating in sunlight, that is specific to sunlight and not just like the light within the store or within the warehouse. And so in actuality, most of the product is not going to be exposed to very much sunlight at all because it would be made in a factory, stored in boxes, transported in boxes. And then stored in the store until you take it home. And then you have to decide where you're going to put it. It probably experiences minimal deterioration in such circumstances. So saying oh the retinol etcetera in this product is completely ineffective because it's in a clear bottle is over-simplistic and negating a lot of the good. \n\nOverall I agree with you but I just wanted to add some of my thoughts.",

I buy cleanser and sometimes moisturizer from DT because I don’t really need actives per se from these products since I use Adapalene. I’m currently using the glow recipe watermelon moisturizer dupe which has niacinamide. I don’t know the quality of the niacinamide nor the percentage but for 1.25 I’m willing to try it since I’m not relying on it solely for an active ingredient. I prefer moisturizers with niacinamide when I can find them at DT. To me this moisturizer is meh - the packaging is nice since it’s a glass jar and it’s 2 oz. But it’s a very “wet” texture which I don’t like because then I can’t apply while my face is still damp which is customary for me. It takes a while to dry too. \n\nAs a side note - does anyone know if you can or need to exfoliate while using Adapalene? The packaging says not to use any other acne product so I just really haven’t really tried it but was curious if anyone knew.",

    "body": "&#x200B;\n\n[Shelfie; I'm on a 3 day cycle \\(exfoliate, retinoid, recover\\). I have combo oily skin that's acne prone, has some unevenness, and have dryness on the cheeks and below the eyes.](https://preview.redd.it/wjk1a59hwu9a1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2e42445669ae6474aec27e18314faddba3c9ddf)\n\nWill RP: \n\n* **SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic: 5/5** I get compliments routinely if someone sees me within a few hours after application. I gave a bottle to my grandma who said, \"It works after one time. What kind of a thing is that?\" You just glow. This being said, I have thought about Silymarin or Phloretin instead since I have prone to acne but haven't yet. I use every morning.\n* **SkinCeuticals Triple Lipid Restore: 4/5** This is one of the best moisturizers ever, with the only 3 things working against it being: A) it's pretty low on the humectant side of the moisturizing house and pretty high on the emollient side (which is fine but can feel a bit waxy), B) it has some essential oils and linalool or limonene I believe, which make it slightly irritating (which I can handle but others may not), and C) it's expensive ($136). It's restorative and truly repairs the skin barrier in a visible way. Excellent for skin that's dry or irritated (provided you can handle the essential oils).\n* **SkinCeuticals Emollience: 5/5** I prefer this to Triple Lipid (although it has a slightly different function and character: TLR is like an expensive suit and Emollience is like a well made linen outfit. TLR is excellent but extra; Emollience is versatile but timeless). It feels more quenching to the skin than TLR (more humectant properties). I love the algae extract, too. Plus, it's \\~1/2 the price of TLR.\n* **SkinCeuticals LHA Cleanser: 4.5/5** I love the menthol and the feeling it creates (cooling). I think the LHA also works well to clear my pores and sebaceous filaments but hard to tell with a cleanser. If you're sensitive, menthol could be an issue. It's not super expensive (\\~$45). I use this whenever I'm not going to be putting retinoid on my face immediately after.\n* **SkinMedica TNS Advanced + Serum 5/5:** Thought long and hard about this one as it's almost double the price of anything else in the cabinet ($295 -- altho $230 if you subscribe and cancel if needed) and it's really marketed for anti-aging market (I'm 26yo male), but jesus christ this stuff is magic. I noticed a tightening of the skin within less than a day after starting to use it. Noticeably reduced fine lines (yes, I have some). I use this after dermarolling .25mm in the shower (as is recommended online by med spas etc). I use this on recovery night.\n* **LRP Anthelios Melt in Milk: 4/5** I like the physical/chemical mix. It has a nice feeling on the face (cooling) and isn't too thick. It works and feels good. I can get away with no moisturizer under it on warm days.\n* (Not pictured) **LRP Toleriane Cleanser: 5/5** Extremely gentle and hydrating. I use before retinoid or if the skin is irritated. \n* **Curology (.01% tretinoin + 2% azaelic + 4% niacinamide): 4/5**: Easy and I like the compounding for my skin type. I will ask to increase tret % soon.\n* **Neutrogena HydroBoost Water Gel 5/5:** Incredible face feel. Cooling and slick and not at all greasy. If you're on a budget, have combo/oily skin, or want something super sheer for daytime use, this is the HG.\n* **SkinMedica HA5 Rejuvinating Hydrator: 4.5/5** I wouldn't say that the effect is immediate here, but I do notice my skin feeling and looking plumper after using this. It's totally non greasy or tacky (not even the case with the HG above) and has urea, serine, and ferment in addition to the 5 molecular weights of HA. I wish it didn't have algin, which can be comedogenic and irritating. But I haven't found it to be either of those. At $187, the price is the major reason I knocked it down a rung on rating. It's not dramatic enough for that price, IMO, but if you can afford, it's great. There are other supporting incis which are impressive like plankton extract, grape flower cell extract, whey protein, and pullulan (the material that makes Listerine breath strips into their thin film gel). I would definitely say this is a tightening product.\n* **First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair: 4/5** I really do love this cream so far. A lot of people say it didn't agree with their skin but as someone who's acne prone with Fitzpatrick type III, I think I can handle the eucalyptus in this. Plus it's affordable relatively ($38 for 6oz) but does leave a bit of a white cast.  Shea + Squalane + Allatonin + Licorice Extract + Green Tea Extract = yummy hydration and calming. Feels a bit like Burts Bees Lip Balm as in it's cooling and healing but also feels like it's increasing circulation.\n\nMight RP:\n\n* **SkinMedica AHA/BHA Cream: 3/5** I like the formulation and face feel here and the price (\\~$40) but some of the ingredients + the results are a bit 🔎 . For starters, I don't know why they use Ascorbyl Palmitate, which has similarly poor stability to ascorbic acid. I also wish they listed the free acid concentration here. I wish no cetyl alcohol either. It's not bad by any means, but I'm curious about other options (isClinical Active Serum -- pls comment if you have experience!) \n* **SkinCeuticals HA Intensifier: 3/5** The proxylane is great and definitely has a good face feel and plumping effect. But the denatured alcohol + the price point + the relatively one dimension of this product (it's p much just HA as opposed to the ultra multitasking HA5) means it's a bit overpriced for what it is ($106) and risky re irritation. Definitely not a no-go but not a favorite for me.\n* **SK-II Pitera Masques: 2/5** @ $16/masque it's just a lot for a single use. If you want to give SK-II Pitera a try, I would get the essence and get 10x the uses. It works for some, others say it breaks them out. I have enough ferment (that's the real key to Pitera) in other products. Obviously not all ferment is the same. Another one to explore besides HA5 would be Estee Lauder ANR.\n* **SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Gel: 3/5** I really like this serum and tbh my skin drinks it up but it's just more relevant if you have pretty reactive skin that gets irritated. It's very cooling and delicious but not a necessity in my routine at the moment. Plus, if your skin is that irritated, you might need to tone down the actives rather than patching with this. Plus, there are irritants (ironically): linalool, benzyl benzoate, parfum, etc.\n* **SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Masque: 2/5** Same as above but even less needed (maybe if you just had a peel it's worth it) but they have alcohol denat and citronellol in this one too. Why? It is very cooling though.\n* **SkinCeuticals A.G.E. Eye Complex: 2/5** A bit burning and irritating to my undereye if I use too frequently. Does have nice smoothing and optical effects (reduced purple undereye and dark circles). Maybe I just have sensitive skin on the eye 🤷 \n* **The Ordinary 5% Caffeine + EGCG Depuffing Eye Serum: 3/5** Same as above (can be irritating if you use too much or too often i.e., every day) but works about as well as AGE Eye Complex for a fraction of the price (\\~$10 vs. $100).\n* **The Ordinary 30% AHA 2% BHA: 3/5** I use this for an occasional peel on my body. It works fine, I think, but microneedling or something professional would likely work better. It's fine and cheap.\n\nWon't RP:\n\n* **SkinMedica AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser: 2.5/5** I really wish SkinMedica would move away from Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate. It's just harsh on the skin and a bit too stripping as a surfactant. There are plenty of other options, and it's not awful (there are a lot of Neutrogena + L'Oreal products that use it) but not ideal. I also wish there were no essential oils (EOs) in this but there's lavender and citrus. The jojoba beads are kinda nice bc they provide a bit of physical exfoliation but then dissolve and are hydrating. It's not awful by any means but for the price (\\~$50) I'm going to keep looking.\n* **SkinMedica Purifying Foaming Wash: 2/5** Too stripping (b/c of Sodium C14-16 Olefine Sulfonate as above) but also has methylisothiazolinone which is probs going to be banned in Denmark, is sensitizing, only allowed currently in rinse off products, and just why? There are other options.\n* **Vichy Eau Thermal: 2/5** Fine. Nothing special. Just water. Might get a spray bottle instead. At $25 for the full size, it just feels silly \n* **Kiehl's Midnight Recovery Concentrate 1/5:** Chock full of EOs. Can be very irritating with almost no benefit you couldn't get from a different product.",

Every time it is in skincare, it makes my forehead so tight it is uncomfortable to me. It definitely seems to have some firming and tightening effects.

It contains complex sugars known as polysaccharides, which makes it a good water-binding agent (i.e. hydration) and antioxidant in skin care products.\nIt is proven to work well as a “carrier” for other skin care actives, effectively delivering the ingredients where they need to go.\nAdditionally, research shows pullulan has the potential to help with strengthening skin’s microbiome. Studies also show it can provide temporary mechanical support for skin’s underlying structures as well as a subtle yet visible lifting effect owing to its non-irritating film-forming properties\nMore recently, pullulan has been utilized in dissolving microneedle patch products where it is believed to enhance transdermal delivery of ingredients. Scientists are also exploring the therapeutic benefits of pullulan-based hydrogel films for various skin conditions.\nAs a texture-enhancing ingredient, characteristics of pullulan include its water solubility and relatively low viscosity compared to other polysaccharides. It possesses good thermal stability and has earned Generally Recognized as Safe (GRaS) status from U.S. FDA.",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F18 (umar badh gayi but dimaag nahi 💀)**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , acne (pustules, fungal and cystic) pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae ](https://preview.redd.it/fnjipguox9ma1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d880ff6b482ade3f03237375ef02cdd64fb4e3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl  Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a  fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\n* **The Derma Co.** **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum** \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredient list** : Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less 😖 if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would  get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation. I found this really mediocre.\n\n* **Axis-Y Complete No-Stress Physical Sunscreen \\[SPF 50+ PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1450 for 50ml (bought for Rs.999 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily combo skin types. those with dry skin like mine, might find it a bit more drying. good one for sensitive skins since it has a lot of calming ingredients as well!\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick white cream. fragrance free but has very strong ayurvedic smell. matte finish. physical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Zinc Oxide, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propanediol, Titanium Dioxide, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Caprylyl Methicone, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Disiloxane, Niacinamide, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Water, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Stearic Acid, Aluminum Hydroxide, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Copaifera Officinalis (Balsam Copaiba) Resin, Tocopherol, Squalane, Allantoin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5\n\n**filters** :\n\n* zinc oxide (mineral filter)\n* titanium dioxide (mineral filter)\n\nthis had been on my 'to buy' list for such a long time! and I finally got it during a march beauty barn sale! when I first tried it, I was really skeptical since it gave me a pretty bad whitecast and smelt so weird. I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop 😭. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :(  but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nupdate : this ones a hard no for me. is it calming? yes. but the whitecast is too much. and when i sweat it literally looks like I'm secreting milk from my skin  (~~nipple)😭😭~~\n\n**rating** : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/​PPG-10/​1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool 🤤 only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure! in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty 😖 I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao 😌 so you can guess I go out a lot heheh. I feel like this one is getting over sooner than others in my ss ki theli 😫 but either way, if you find a good deal on it, blindly add this to your cart and order it. you wont be dissappointed!\n\nrating : 5/5 and WRP on reduced mrp only.\n\n* **Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun : Rice + Probiotics (SPF50+ PA++++)**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1530 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1200 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : dry, sensitive, acne prone and combination\n\n**texture and appearance** : creamy white lotion (ya nasty-). unscented ( ha, ha , aur socho ashleel cheeze 🤡)\n\n**ingredients list :**   Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Water, Glycerin, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Behenyl Alcohol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Sodium Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Water, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/​VP Copolymer, Polyisobutene, Silica, Caprylyl/​Capryl Glucoside, Sorbitan Oleate, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Bifida Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacillus Ferment,Streptococcus Thermophilus Ferment\n\n**filters :**\n\n* uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nthis deserves all the hype it gets on the net. my current and forever HG sunscreen (unless they change formulation). seriously this ticks all the boxes . no whitecast? check. great filters? check. doesn't make you face look like you rub pan grease on it? check. it absorbs so well and is more moisturizing than some of the moisturizers out there. obviously, wished we would get more quantity for the price paid but itna criticise karne ke baad bhi, brands toh behre hai 😔and on reapplication, doesnt feel like im doing the 100 layers challenge lol. plus , I don't feel regret when applying it these days, cuz no fear of sunscreen melting during winters (#rajailife) . *taareef karu kya uski, jisneee tujhe banayaaaa✨\\~*\n\n**rating :** 5/5 and forever HG\n\n* **Benton Mineral Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 15g (haalat kharab biros). got it at 30% on beauty barn\n\n**For skin types** : normal and sensitive skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : a white stick. that's it. kind of a really thick lotion like texture. unscented and smol. mineral sunstick.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Coco-caprylate/caprate, sunflower seed wax, propylene glycol dicaprylate, H-di/trimethylol hexyllactone cross polymer, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, titanium dioxide, dicaprylyl carbonate, Synthetic fluorphlogopite, vinyl dimethicone, microcrystalline wax, aluminum stearate, polyhydroxystearic acid, purslane extract, centella extract, sodium hyaluronate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, sodium Acetylated hyaluronate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, polyglyceryl-4diisostearate/polyhydroxystearate/sebacate, silica, alumina, pentylene glycol, allantoin, panthenol, Glycerin, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Xylyl Glucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Glucose, Glyceryl Caprylate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Stearic Acid, Tocopherol, Purified Water, 1, 2-hexanediol, ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**filters** :\n\n* titanium dioxide\n\nthis one came around the same time as the tocobo sunstick on beauty barn so being the ✨phisool kharchi wala baccha✨, I bought both of them. unfortunately , this one was a big letdown. how tf can a sunstick leave a whitecast? this one is a great example. first off, it requires a lot of pressing and dragging across the face to dispense , so not fond of that, especially when I have active acne. secondly, it legit looks like someone rubbed fair and lovely mixed with water on my face 💀. its not waterproof, expensive for the quantity you get and gives a disappointing finish and result. I'm not particularly sure about protection against sun on this one but oh well. also piddu si stick hai so kind of cute but lootne wala hai lmao\n\n**rating** : 2/5 and WNRP\n\n* **Tocobo** **Cotton Soft Airy Sun Stick SPF50 Pa++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1550 for 20g (bought at 1100 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily, combination, acne prone skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale blue long cylinderical like stick. has a really pleasant and soft floral fragrance . leaves a matte fininsh and doesnt feel greasy on apllication. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list :**  Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Niacinamide, Tromethamine, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Pentylene Glycol, Polysilicone-15, Vigna Radiata Seed Extract, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Extract, Sophora Flavescens Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum Root/Stalk Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Oenothera Biennis (evening primrose) Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Seed Oil, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Fragrance\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* titanium dioxide (physical filter)\n\nprobably the only sun stick that comes even close to the isntree sun stick. this gives such a good matte finish without any greasy feel . plus has cute floral smell to it that doesn't transfer to your skin or anything. and damn what a bang for a buck. probably the closest dupe for the isntree one. the only con is that it kind of pills after the 3rd application and rubs of oily after a while. if you are a person who touches their face every once in a while (like my dumbass), you might find it a bit uncomfortable. that being said, most of the times I just blot the grease away after 3-4hrs of application and apply another layer afterwards. sun protection wise, it does a good job! my forehead is the area that is the most prone to getting tan and it looked quite even toned after 3 weeks of consecutive use. one of my most favorite sticks (😏)\n\n**rating** : 4.5/5 and lets seeee\n\n* **Neutrogena beach defense sun stick water + sun protection SPF 50+**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs 1260 for 42 g (got it at Rs. 900 from amazon)\n\n**for skin types** : honestly, none lmao. I used it as a body stick most of the time with how oily this was. but can be used by anyone ig\n\n**texture and appearance** : whitish yellow stick. has a fruity kind of smell. really oily and greasy on first application that doesn't absorb or goes away after a while.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Polyethylene, Isohexadecane, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Ozokerite, Paraffin, Synthetic Beeswax, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Neopentyl Glycol Diisostearate, Dimethicone, Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Fragrance, BHT\n\n**filters** :\n\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n\noof this was an impulse purchase that I regretted later on. mind you, this is a great sunstick for your body but definitely not for your face . not to mention its waterproof . but the tapti garmi really just melts everything in its way and this is no exception. bhai itna chip chipa lagta hai i dont even feel like putting this on just because of the MoIsT feeling it gives. unless you're going to a pool or beach (as it suggests duh) , if you're okay with feeling like [that peanut butter baby](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.ie%2Flife%2Ffamily%2Fthis-peanut-butter-baby-is-sure-to-brighten-up-your-day-31499579.html&psig=AOvVaw0Qc7SXcD436wP5Ywrn_yJv&ust=1678212392776000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCIDzt77yx_0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) , then you can give it a try. it  does provide a good amount of product for the price and is a solid waterproof one fosho. but nahi jhela jata for some reason 😣😣😫\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\nme after buying and trying all of these to find my HG\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zzjpjrbly9ma1.gif\n\nbut it was fun doing this in a span of a few years and I finally got one that fits all my boxes . the BOJ one is seriously godsent for me ✨✨~~lets just ignore that it makes my wallet cry every time I buy it .~~ But id rather spend more on stuff that works than just hit and trials lmao. also I've gone past my obsession on using sun sticks as a whole since they require quite a lot of pressing while applying and the application just irritates my acne a lot 😫 imma finish the ones I have but I have no intentions on buying anymore from any brands (even though the minimalist and earth rhythm ones look good 🤡)more reviews to come! ill be doing one on stuff my dad will be bringing from the U.S in the next few weeks so do let me know if you'd like a follow up on those too! (~~why do i treat my posts like a sitcom😭).~~  and as always, any other questions, comments are always welcomed and so are dms!\n\nbyeeee 💖💖",

        "body": "also my post exceeded the word limit so here's some more lmao :\n\n   \n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF      50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n   \n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte      Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable      UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB      filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV      filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB      mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change",

    "body": "So I always thought that ferments were a \"Asian skin care\" thing. But ever since getting some high end Western skin care as gifts, I noticed that many of them actually have a lot of fermented/yeasty ingredients in them.\n\nBut I can't find much on the \\~science\\~ or evidence behind why ferments can be good for your skin. But I also wonder, since ferments aren't really a thing that majority of consumers in the Western market are looking out for (like fragrance, rose water, coconut water, rosehip oil, fruit/veggie extracts that have label/experience appeal, but aren't necessarily good for skin), why would these huge companies bother putting ferments in their expensive skin care if they didn't have evidence that they do SOMETHING?\n\nI especially am curious because AB/Korean beauty are sometimes looked down upon as just being trendy and not using ingredients that are scientifically proven to be truly beneficial for skin.\n\nDo you think ferments are legit? What do they do for YOUR skin? Your fav AB fermented products or ones you are wanting to try?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are some of the leave-on skin care from [Sephora's \"Best Selling\" skin

Fermenting antioxidant rich ingredients such as ginseng, green tea etc. breaks down the antioxidants/complex molecules that are beneficial to our skin into smaller molecules, which allows it to be absorbed into the skin easily. Not only that, yeast/bacteria ferments produce additional metabolites (AHAs, peptides) that provide additional benefits such as whitening, hydration, skin repair, you name it!\n\nEdit: forgot to put my favorite fermented product!! I love the Manyo Factory Galactomyces Niacin Special treatment. :) \n\n2nd Edit: here are the links to some scientific literature articles on fermented cosmetics which were found through PubMed!

    "body": "Having a really hard time finding a sunscreen that meets my demands\n\nFirst of all my skin type: Sensitive, reactive, somewhat acne prone and combination. Generally normal (sometimes a bit dry) on my cheeks and forehead but quite oily on my nose even in the winter. Chin is either normal or slightly oily.\n\nNow onto finding a sunscreen…\n\nMust be:\n\nCruelty free\n\nReef safe\n\nEWG approved\n\nNon-comedogenic (or only a few low comedogenic ingredients. Comedogenic can be subjected so not every so called comedogenic ingredient is going to make everyone break out)\n\nNon-acnegenic (acnegenic and comedogenic are similar but not the same. And of course the same principal above applies).\n\nSafe for fungal acne as I have a tendency to get fungal acne breakouts on my cheeks (a few ingredients that are triggers MIGHT be ok but if there’s a lot of them it probably won’t work. I would really have to try a product out to see how I’ll react)\n\nSilicone free. I know a lot of people will say that silicone doesn’t clog pores but I’ve had a reaction to every single product I’ve had with silicone in it even if none of the other ingredients bother me.\n\nAlcohol free (fatty alcohols are ok)\n\nSLS free\n\nFragrance free. Remember that ‘fragrance’ is an umbrella term used so companies can add in whatever chemicals they want without having to label them. FYI even essential oils in a lot of more ‘natural’ sunscreens can irritate me. Especially citrus ones.\n\nNot full of unnecessary fillers\n\nLightweight, fully absorbable and non-tacky and non-greasy. Something with more of a gel or lotion consistency would be a lot better than your typical sun screen texture.\n\nMust wear well under makeup as I wear liquid foundation (water and aloe based).\n\nIf it contains zinc oxide it must be at least 20% or 15% with 7.5% titanium dioxide\n\nAntioxidants would be nice\n\nPhotostable of course\n\nBulletproof\n\nCures cancer\n\nCosts less than 10 cents wouls be great\n\nEdible (i've experienced hunger before)\n\nShelf life at least a decade (i might tolerate 9 years, i have to try it first)\n\nI was suggested Elta MD UV Clear and the ingredients look ok except it is very low in zinc oxide. I looked up Ren Clean Screen although it has lots of oils in it and being that my skincare and makeup is water based I’m not sure if it would place nice. It also has Citronellol, Geraniol, Limonene and Linalool which are considered to be irritating fragrances.\n\nI have Derma E oil free sunscreen but it’s too sticky and does NOT work with liquid foundation. Someone suggested making sure I pat my foundation to blend, not swipe or rub it in. That’s how I apply it with a damp sponge. It’s a bit hard to explain it but it might look ok for a minute or two and then all of a sudden it looks horrible. Like my skin underneath is starting to heat up and dissolve the foundation. It looks splotchy and patchy. If I only use mineral powder it works ok (though I prefer the look and coverage of liquid) but another issue is that this sunscreen causes a lot of sweating (at least for me. It makes my face feel hot) so my face is ultimately going to turn into a greasy mess.\n\nA lot of people suggest Asian or European sunscreens yet I haven't been able to find any so far with ingredients that are suitable. I won't use any sunscreen until all these demands are met! So get those recs in, pores!",

But I think it's starting to make some headway. :\\^)\n\n**Panthenol** is a derivative of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It's readily absorbed by our skin and converted to vitamin b5 since it is naturally produced by our bodies. It's approved by the FDA at 2% and higher for wound healing and anti-itching. It also acts as a humectant, drawing water to the skin. (It's great for hair as well!) So it's really effective for strengthening our skin barrier at 2-5%. It's also a penetration enhancer.\n\nHowever, the studies were all done on products with only little amounts of water in them, so for watery products, you may need it at a higher percentage for it to work better ([Swift Crafty Monkey blog](https://www.swiftcraftymonkey.blog/humectants-panthenol-a-closer-look/)), like at **5-10%.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease check out the Western Beauty version of this list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/fz2l58/list_of_panthenol_products_western_version/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Key**\n\nEO = Essential Oil\n\n$ -

I remember being always kinda blown away by how lightweight it was yet packed a massive punch at calming and rebuilding my skin barrier from tretinoin and overexfoliation. And guess what it works on giant cystic acne that TO's bha being completely useless at treating. From what I know it's not available outside of Apac region, which is a travesty because good skincare should be had by all. \n\nBut I'm in Malaysia and Hada Labo is practically everywhere. So the only products I have repurchased so far are rhe super economical ones like Hada Labo's premium hydrating lotion (gold bottle), rich hydrating lotion (the one with 3 molecular weights of ha), premium whitening lotion (tranexamic acid), inkey list niacinamide serum, Q10 serum, bha serum, and their bha cleanser.\n\nYes, fragrance free advocate here.",

    "body": "Cleansing balms\n\nUPDATE 8/20/20: I’m adding a new balm I’ve recently tried (at the bottom of the list). If anyone has tried balms that you’d like to review in the format used, please post them below!!!\n\nOk, I’ve been (still am) on a mission to try and review all of the best/most popular cleansing balms in an effort to find the very very best one. I’ve tried nearly all of the most popular ones now. I searched everywhere for a comprehensive review of all of these and couldn’t find much so I’m hoping this will be a helpful resource to others who might be looking too. I welcome any input!!\n\nBackstory:\nI had been using The Body Shop’s Camomile balm since way before cleansing balms went mainstream, for probably a decade at least. I never knew there were other options until I was given a sample of Farmacy Green Clean and that’s what started me down this path - I wanted to see what the best option truly is! I liked my Camomile but could there be a better balm out there waiting for me??!\n\nAs always, YMMV but below are my results! All prices are in Canadian dollars and I have not researched pricing or availability in other countries.\n\nAs for what I actually use it for - I don’t wear a full face of makeup every single day but I do always wear a tinted sunscreen and mascara at a minimum, usually with a light powder foundation, blush and brow gel as well. I’ve tried every balm below on little to no makeup up to a full face of special occasion makeup.\n\nA note about ingredients - I’ve copied ingredient lists below from the brands websites. It was important to me to evaluate which ones have polyethylene (plastic) as well as essential oils.\n\nI would LOVE to hear your thoughts on those below or any other options I haven’t tried yet!\n\n**TL;DR FINAL VERDICT**: for a really good clean and soft face, Drunk Elephant’s Slaii is probably the best value in terms of value, packaging, ingredients, etc. I think this will continue to be my go to in the super dry winter months (especially since I tend to wear a bit thicker makeup in the winter), but to be honest, I think I will probably continue use my trusty Body Shop Camomile Cleansing Butter in the summers.\n\n**The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter**\n\nSize: 90mL (3oz).   \nPrice: $17 CAD @ The Body Shop reg price (but it’s often on sale).   \nPrice per oz: $5.67/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a wide and flat metal tin that is perfect for storing bobby pins or things in after (no plastic packaging, yay!). I have had a few times over the years where the threads get misaligned and stuck if it was tightened wrong and have needed to use a knife or screwdriver to pry it open again.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.   \nTexture & Emulsion: When scooping the balm out, it stays a little solid as you rub it into your skin. I wouldn’t say it emulsifies 100% to an oil but it feels great on the face and it’s super spreadable once warmed up. Doesn’t feel greasy/oily, more creamy.    \nScent: Very neutral scent, I don’t believe there are any added scents, essential oils or fragrances.    \nOn the Eyes: It doesn’t sting the eyes at all, but sometimes there’s a light film, if so I just blink a few times and it goes away.    \nAmount Required: A very small amount is required for my whole face (probably about 1/2 tsp max) and one tin easily lasts me a few months.    \nIngredients: No plastic to be found here! I also love that the ingredient list is short and sweet.    \nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Citric Acid.    \n\nVERDICT: I’ve loved this forever and to be honest, now that I’ve tried some others I’m not totally sure if the grass is actually greener on the other side. Still a top contender for me and the price is amazing! I do wonder though if my skin feels a just a tiny bit less moisturized after using this (compared to some of the others below)...\n\n**Farmacy Green Clean** \n\nSize: 90mL (3oz).   \nPrice: $45 CAD @ Sephora Canada.   \nPrice per oz: $15/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes, but the plastic tray it is stored in is very flimsy (sits in top of the tub).    \nTexture & Emulsion: When scooping the balm out, it melts easily and emulsifies quickly to rub around your face. Not greasy/oily.    \nScent: Light citrusy scent (almost like a lime sherbert or something) that smells so good I just want it all over my face all the time.    \nOn the Eyes: I do find it causes quite a bit of a film if I use it on the eyes (something I’d never really experienced before with the Camomile balm), no stinging unless it gets directly in the eyes. Makeup dissolves easily with minimal rubbing or tugging.    \nAmount Required: A small amount is required.    \nIngredients: While they say it’s not “microbeads” and that it melts in water, this product does contain polyethylene aka plastic. Take that for what you will. This product does have quite a bit of essential oils and extracts.    \n\nCetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Peg-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Peg-10 Isostearate, Polyethylene, Phenoxyethanol, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Amino Esters-1, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Amber Powder, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Water/ Aqua/ Eau, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Echinacea Purpurea Root Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Moringa Pterygosperma Seed Extract, Disodium Phosphate, Citric Acid.   \n\n\nVERDICT: I like it, I love it, I want some more of it. It smells amazing and feels luxurious on the face. Even though a little goes a long way, I do have a hard time justifying spending that much money on a first cleanser (and I don’t love that it contains polyethylene and a lot of essential oils).\n\n**Physicians Formula The Perfect Matcha 3-in-1 Melting Cleansing Balm**\n\nSize: 41mL (1.4oz).  \nPrice: $15 CAD @ Shoppers Drug Mart (also find at Walmart, Superstore etc).   \nPrice per oz: $10.71/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a screw top and an internal insert underneath. The insert holds the very tiny spatula.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes but it’s tiny, about the size of a safety pin.   \nTexture & Emulsion: It melts but it’s not overly emollient and isn’t as spreadable as others I’ve tried.    \nScent: Sort of a light essential oily/green tea/citrus scent. Some say it smells like Green Clean but I completely disagree and it’s nowhere near as nice of a smell.    \nOn the Eyes: A bit of eye stinging and a definite film was to be had.    \nAmount Required: Larger amount required to effectively remove makeup/sunscreen of any I’ve tried to date.    \nIngredients: Looks like we have that ever present plastic again (polyethylene) as well as fragrance, food colouring and citrus essential oils. Sad face.    \nCETYL ETHYLHEXANOATE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SORBETH-30 TETRAOLEATE, PEG-5 GLYCERYL TRIISOSTEARATE, PEG-10 ISOSTEARATE, POLYETHYLENE, FRAGRANCE/PARFUM, CAMELLIA SINENSIS LEAF POWDER*, PHYLLOSTACHYS EDULIS SHOOT WATER**, NELUMBO NUCIFERA FLOWER EXTRACT***, CITRUS NOBILIS (MANDARIN ORANGE) PEEL OIL, WATER/EAU, PHENOXYETHANOL, SORBITAN SESQUIOLEATE, POLYGLYCERYL-10 OLEATE, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, LACTIC ACID, SODIUM BENZOATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, MALTODEXTRIN, YELLOW 5 (CI 19140), BLUE 1 (CI 42090). *MATCHA, **BAMBOO, ***LOTUS\n\nVERDICT: It’s a no from me, dawg. I couldn’t wait to finish this (relatively small) tub so I could try the next product. Having heard so many claims that it’s a perfect dupe for Green Clean, I was VERY disappointed. IMO they are nothing alike other than the colour (both balms are a light green colour). Smell, texture, effectiveness, price, ingredients - nothing wowed me.\n\n**Heimish All Clean Balm**\n\nSize: 120mL (4oz).   \nPrice: $23.95 CAD @ Amazon.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $5.99/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a flip top. Under the lid is a second lid which holds the included spatula. I like that the spatula is separated from the product but the extra lid makes it extra bulky in my cabinet.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes.   \nTexture & Emulsion: This balm I’d say emulsified almost immediately to a complete oil. It has a light oil feel (similar to say a sunflower oil, not as thick as an olive oil for example). It melts right away once it touches your face and feels like an oil face massage as you rub it in. It feels quite luxurious!    \nScent: Light floral scent (smells like essential oils). I like it and it’s not too overpowering IMO but I have heard some people find it too strong of a scent.    \nOn the Eyes: No stinging and the eye film is minimal.    \nAmount Required: I’d say a medium amount. Definitely more than the Camomile and Green Clean but it doesn’t seem excessive.    \nIngredients: There is polyethylene (plastic) in this as well as a number of essential oils which those with sensitive skin may wish to avoid.    \nEthylhexyl palmitate, cetyl ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, polyethylene, PEG-8 isostearate, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, cocos nucifera (coconut) fruit extract, citrus aurantifolia (lime) fruit extract, freesia refracta extract, iris versicolor extract, jasminum officinale (jasmine) extract, lilium tigrinum extract, leontopodium alpinum extract, nelumbium speciosum flower extract, narcissus pseudo-narcissus (daffodil) flower extract, rose extract, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) peel oil, lavandula angustifolia (lavender) oil, pelargonium graveolens flower oil, amyris balsamifera bark oil, citrus paradisi (grapefruit) peel oil, eucalyptus globulus leaf oil, melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) leaf oil, juniperus mexicana oil, boswellia carterii oil, citrus aurantium bergamia (bergamot) fruit oil, tocopheryl acetate, 1,2-hexanediol.\n\nVERDICT: There’s a lot to love about this - the scent and the texture are awesome, the price is definitely right, and I enjoy using it. My skin does always feel great after and it doesn’t dry me out. Cons for me are the bulky packaging, the amount of essential oils and the microbeads. I do like it but I’m not ready to stop my search quite yet.\n\n**Drunk Elephant Slaai**\n\nSize: 115mL (3.83oz).   \nPrice: $45 @ Sephora Canada.   \n(Note that this price includes a small vial of Bamboo Booster (physical exfoliating grains) as well).   \nPrice per oz: $11.75/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top. The spatula is magnetic and sits on top of the tub via a magnet (super handy for the makeup cupboard but also exposed/can pop off in a makeup bag while travelling).    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes.    \nTexture & Emulsion: Feels like softened butter and emulsifies to a thick oil feeling (similar to olive oil).     \nScent: Neutral, but a light olive oil type scent. I wish it had a nicer smell but it’s not offensive.     \nOn the Eyes: No stinging, easily removed eye makeup.    \nAmount Required: just a little, I’d say the smallest amount of any I’ve tried which is great news for it lasting a good while.\n\nIngredients: There don’t appear to be any polyethylene in this product and it’s lighter on the essential oils as well (good news if you have sensitive skin).\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Lauryl Laurate, Polyglyceryl-3 Laurate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Wax, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Oil, Actinidia Chinensis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Ananassa (Strawberry) Seed Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Polyglyceryl-2 Caprate, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Seed Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Schinziophyton Rautanenii Kernel Oil, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Ximenia Americana Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Glycerin\n\nVERDICT: Love love love! Definitely don’t use too much but when using a small amount the oiliness isn’t too much and it makes my face feel soft and clean. However, a second cleanse is a must.\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Balm**\n\nSize: 125mL (4.17oz).    \nPrice: $40 @ Sephora Canada.    \nPrice per oz: $9.59/oz.    \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.    \nTexture & Emulsion: Texture is comparable to a solid form coconut oil (similar to the Heimish balm in texture and colour also). Emulsified quickly to a soft oil.    \nScent: Unscented.    \nOn the Eyes: A light film, but no stinging. Takes extra rubbing to loosen stubborn eye makeup.    \nAmount Required: Medium amount (not as much as Heimish but not as little as Drunk Elephant).    \n\nIngredients: Very short ingredients list but unfortunately, those classic plastics are in this balm as well (polyethylene).\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate , Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil , Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride , Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate , Polyethylene , Peg-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate , Water\\Aqua\\Eau , Tocopherol , Phenoxyethanol\n\nVERDICT: Honestly, I have no real bad things to say. It’s utilitarian. It doesn’t feel luxurious but it works.\n\n\n**Acure Seriously Soothing 3 in 1 Serum**\n\nSize: 50mL (1.7 oz).   \nPrice: $23.49 @ well.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $13.82/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a glass jar with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.   \nTexture & Emulsion: A very soft solid serum that gets a little melty when room temperature is quite warm. It melts immediately in your hand/on your face and becomes a liquidy oil. It feels luxurious but does leave an oily film so a second cleanse is definitely required.\nScent: Strong scent due to the blue tansy oil (some might not like it but I do!)\nOn the Eyes: It’s very gentle and doesn’t sting or leave a film.\nAmount Required: Very little required. I’d say about half a teaspoon for my whole face including eye makeup.\nIngredients: No plastic here! Just very basic natural ingredients.\n\nCaprylic/capric Triglyceride, Euphorbia Cerifera(Candelilla) Wax, Copernicia Cerifera(Carnauba) Wax, Butyrospermum Parkii(Shea) Butter, Rosa Canina(Rosehip) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa(Argan) Oil, Tocopherol(Vitamin E), Tanacetum Annum (Blue Tansy)flower Oil, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant)seed Oil.\n\nVERDICT: I didn’t originally buy this for a cleanser, (just as a balm) but used it in a pinch as my first cleanse when I accidentally lost my jar of Slaai on a camping trip. I love how my skin feels soft and soothed after using it as a cleanser and it feels so silky on my skin. It is a little on the expensive side but I think it’s a keeper for sure seeing as it’s so versatile!!\n\n**Banila Co.

    "body": "I have been a long time devoted user of the Round Lab Mugwort Calming Cleanser, and would consider it my HG. I can't even remember how many tubes of it I've gone through. Recently I've noticed that it's started going up in price (last time I bought it I had to pay $26 CAD), and it's become increasingly hard to justify that price for a cleanser. So when I saw this Bring Green Artemisia pH Balancing Foam at my local kbeauty shop for $13.99 CAD I had to try it!\n\n\nSkin type: combination, dehydrated, acne and clog prone\n\n\nRound Lab Ingredients:\n\nWater, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Butylene Glycol, Coco-Betaine, Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Artemisia Vulgaris Extract, Aspartic Acid, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl Glycol, Polyquaternium-67, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Malt Extract, 1,2- Hexanediol, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Allantoin, Madecassoside, Panthenol, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid\n\n\nBring Green Ingredients:\n\nGlycerin, Purified Water, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Lauryl Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Artemisia Capillaris Extract (8,000ppm), Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Malt Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Lavender Oil, Citrus Nobilis (Mandarin Orange) Peel Oil, Rosemary Leaf Oil, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Orange Peel Oil, Polyquaternium-39, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder (800ppm), Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Ethylhexylglycerin, Linalool, Limonene \n\n\nBoth cleansers claim to be pH balanced at 5.5 and gentle on the skin. That I will say is true, I never had irritation using the Round Lab, and in the 4 times I've used the Bring Green I didn't either. They both leave my skin feeing properly cleansed without being stripped or dry. \n\n\nTexture wise I prefer the Round Lab. It has a slightly thicker texture which foams up to a nice rich foam. However at times it can take a little extra effort to rinse away. The Bring Green does foam up just as well, but it isn't as rich of a foam. It contains very tiny visible bits of mugwort, but they're so small you don't feel them. It also rinses away much cleaner and faster. \n\n\nIn terms of scent the Round Lab doesn't really have one, it smells very faintly of mugwort. The Bring Green however has a light citrus scent due to the essential oils, but it isn't overpowering and doesn't linger once rinsed. \n\n\nOverall I think I might end up switching to the Bring Green. Although the user experience might not be as pleasant as when using the Round Lab, for almost half the price it's definitely worth keeping in my routine.",

    "body": "#Rant#\n\nUntil recently, i only used sulphate free shampoos thinking it would be much better for my wavy/curly hair but i always used so much of product (even after dissolving it in water and emulsifying in my hands), they never removed the oil one go either leading me to go for a second rinse which inturn wastes water and it took me so much of time to just shampoo my hair. \n\nI was fear-mongered HARD. I have tried so many sulphate free shampoos and never stuck to one, i was never impressed with any. So many of them i just ended up using on my body because i got bored of them and didn't like them. At first, i believed the \"sUlpHatEs aRe bAd fOR YoU' movie trop and then, when i got to know about the CGM, i got even more afraid of them (double homicide, if i may). But over the past year ive tried some shampoos with sls in them and i always noticed less hairfall.\n\nI have been concerned about my hairfall for years, ive lost the volume i used to have back in school and mom's comments on my hair is just the cherry on cake i need. I am trying my best to feel confident in the hair I have and not letting insecurities affect me yet trying to take care of them and reduce as much of hairfall as possible. \n\nI am, i think, loosing the normal amount of hair its just my brain telling me that I need to immediately rush to the doctor. Lowkey a triggering topic, tbvh. \n\nI am just thankful i started using sulphates again and i dont have any plans to stop. Plus sulphates are better for my oily scalp.\n\n#Review#\n\nPrice- Rs. 149 for 192.5 ml.\n\nINGREDIENTS: WATER SUM LAURETH SULFATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE, DIMETHICONE, FRAGRANCE, C177891/TITANIUM DIOXIDE, GUAR HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, NIACINAMIDE, CASTOR SEED OIL, MICA, COCO-BETAINE, SODIUMBENZOATE, SODIUMHYDROXIDE, HYDROXYCITRONELLAL, HYDROLYZED SOY PROTEIN, HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARETH-6, ACETIC ACID, PEG-100 STEARATE, TRIDECETH-10, TRIDECETH-S SALICYLICACID, LIMONENE, FUMARICACIO PANTHENOL BENZYL SALICYLATE, LINALOOL BENZYLALCOHOL, PENTYLENE GLYCOL AMODIMETHICONE, ALPHA-ISOMETHYL JONONE, CARSONER, GERANIOL, CITRIC ACID CITRONELLOL, COUMARIN, HEXYLENE GLYCOL HEXYL CINNAMAL, GLYCERIN, GLYCOL DISTEARATE (FLL CE552/).\n\nHairtype- wavy/curly, oily scalp, dry ends.\n\nHair care Products- khadi protein mask (once a week), aloe gel (whenever i feel like), livon (trying to finish it up).\nI have stopped oiling completely\n\nI recently shifted L'oreal Dream Lengths Shampoo (because of the rave reviews here) and i think I have finally found the shampoo for me (don't want to jinx). I get less hairfall, it emulsifies easily, i dont need to spend a ton of time rubbing it in to remove any sort of build up and I haven't noticed any dryness of my hair as such. I haven't seen any difference in curls either (NOTE: I dont follow CGM rigorously, i have just picked up a couple of steps that suit me).\n\nI shampoo twice a week, once a week i either do aloeing or apply the khadi mask (an HG btw). Then i wrap my hair in a t-shirt and also wear a satin hair bonnet while sleeping. I have almost stopped using hair ties and only stick to those huge-ass clutchers (clips). I dont use any products after shampooing because i hate the feeling. I'll just sometimes use livon to finish that up but i don't think I'll be able to before it expires.\n\nMy shampoo method- I take a little bit of a shampoo in a mug, add water onto it and pour it on my scalp ONLY. I dont wash my ends everytime i shampoo, like once a week is enough. \n\nStatus- WRP",

I am using the L'Oréal Total Repair 5 and I have no complaints. \n\nThe most important thing in my opinion is the conditioner. Even then it's more about letting the conditioner sit and work for a few minutes that makes a lot of difference. I have tried Pantene, Sunsilk, TRESemmé and Garnier Ultra Blends conditioners and the Pantene works really well for my fine hair.

A homemade serum after wash (aloevera gel, rose essential oil, glycerine, rose water), this makes my hair smell heavenly nice. Only I use it \n3. Cold pressed coconut oil before hair wash - for 1-2 hr , only me and my mom do the oiling part.\n4. Washing my hair more often - 3 times a week\n\nNow I would like the share the mistakes I used to make which when corrected helped me in hairfall.\n\n+ oiling for long hours -  I used to oil my hair a night before hairwash day.

So now I make sure that I don't keep oil in my hair for more than 2 hrs.\n\n+ Oiling with the right oil - I used to oil my hair with dabur amla hair oil  after which I switched to pure coconut oil.\n\n+ Diet - I eat 2 soaked walnuts, 10 soaked almonds, 2 soaked anjeer, 2 cashews. I drink anjeer water with anjeer. I have been following this religiously for a very long time. And I believe this has helped immensely in improving my hair texture. \n\n+ Washing my hair after every 2nd day - I have noticed that after every 2nd my hair gets oily and itchy and if I don't wash it the same day. My hair starts to fall out. I sort of wash my hair at every alternate day.\n\nLet me know if you guys have any questions related to this. \n\nHAPPY TO HELP 😊",

It's impossible to last without sulphates. Most CG shampoos also have milder sulphates because they're cleansing agents. Shampoos also tend to have polyquaternium which is a conditioning agent that builds up (certain kinds of Polyquaternium build up more than others). Without sulphates you won't get rid of the buildup and it will lead to poor scalp health. \n\nI use Pantene Lively Clean every once in a while (maybe once a month, twice in the humid summers). It's got \"harsh\" sulphates which strip my hair and scalp clean of all buildup. Unfortunately with really short hair you can't avoid getting shampoo all up in your hair. \n\nAs to whether sulphates cause less hairfall, I won't comment because everyone shair and scalp are different. I found a method that works for me and In glad you could introduce it to your routine too without much issue :) \n\nSulphates and silicones aren't necessarily bad. It's also important to remember that you lose more hair during high humidity conditions. That's normal.",

    "body": "We see a lot of posts about cannabis here on r/migraines, I thought I'd make a little super guide for people interested in trying it. As someone who has used cannabis to treat her chronic migraines since she was 15! (I’m 25 now)\n\n(tldr at the end)\n\n———\n\nEdit: commenters have mentioned interactions between medication and cannabis and I think that’s important to note (specifically CGRPs and Lyrica). However it is hard to find conclusive studies on these interactions due to cannabis being illegal federally. It is important to talk to your doctor about using cannabis. \n\nCannabis may not be an option for everyone, and it won’t work for everyone. This is just a guide for IF you’d like to try it and where to begin. If you don’t feel relief, or it makes you feel worse, it just might not be the right option for you and that’s ok! \n\n———\n\n**What type of cannabis should I be looking for?**\n\nType depends on how you'd like to consume cannabis. Vaping and smoking are going to be your fastest way to get relief. This can be done through flower or through concentrates (think of dabs if you know what that is). \n\nMore long term effects are best ingested, such as edibles or tinctures. They take a bit to take effect though, so if I go for an edible perhaps, I will also vape first to get immediate relief. Smoking itself is known to cause headaches, so that's always a risk. I personally prefer vaping CBD full spectrum concentrates, because it’s less harsh than smoke.\n\n**Full spectrum? What is that? Am I supposed to be looking for something specific?**\n\nThere's two routes you can go when choosing products. Primarily THC products or CBD products. THC is the part of cannabis that has a psychoactive effect, so you'll get high. CBD does not have a psychoactive effect. However the two are best used together, as they have a synergistic effect (meaning they work better together than separate).\n\nIf you're not looking to get high, you'll be looking for CBD products. When you're shopping for products, you'll see things like \"broad spectrum\" and \"full spectrum\" and isolates. \n\n*Broad spectrum* means that almost everything that is in the cannabis plant is in your product, except THC. This includes other cannabinoids and terpenes. These products are generally made by adding different components of cannabis together, rather than coming directly from a cannabis plant.\n\nHowever, we know that THC and CBD work best together, so you most likely want to look for *Full Spectrum* products. Full Spectrum products are derived from cannabis and contain THC, but very little. I have personally never experienced a high from full spectrum products, however you may not be able to pass a drug test (I have also heard the same for Broad Spectrum).\n\nThere are also *CBD isolates*, which is pure CBD with no other cannabinoids or terpenes. I personally don't find these helpful, as it's the synergistic relationship between THC and CBD and other cannabinoids and terpenes that I have found the most helpful (and has studies to back that up).\n\n**Cannabinoids? Terpenes? Help.**\n\nWhen we break down a cannabis plant chemically there's other things in there besides CBD and THC. Such as cannabinoids and terpenes. These are important to pay attention to because the specific cannabinoids and terpenes in products can help you choose a product that will most likely work better for you based on their medicinal benefits. \n\nCannabinoids are biological compounds that bind to cannabinoid receptors in your endocannabinoid system. Your endocannabinoid system is a biological system in your body that helps regulate and balance key biological functions, such as neuronal synaptic transmission, how your brain communicates. It also has been shown to have a key role in chronic neuropathic pain, i.e. migraines.\n\nI have seen cannabinoids listed most often in stores where cannabis is regulated. It's shown as a percentage, listed alongside the two main cannabinoids, THC and CBD.\n\nTerpenes are what is responsible for your flavor and aroma in cannabis. They're basically essential oils. However there are studies showing how they interact with the endocannabinoid system and cannabinoid receptors and therefore why they have the certain effects that we see. It's not just aromatherapy, or pseudoscience, as I've seen claimed before. \n\n**But which ones do I choose !!!**\n\nCannabinoids for migraines are going to be anti-inflammatory, because there is evidence of neurogenic inflammation leading up to a migraine. These include primarily:\n\n* CBG: most common in hemp strains (have a low THC percentage), also have an anti-depressant effect but can be an appetite stimulant, so be prepared to have the munchies\n* THCA: also anti-nausea\n* CBC: can make you reaaally sleepy though and it has sedative qualities\n\nalmost all cannabinoids do show anti-inflammatory effects, but the 3 listed above are the strongest in that department. High CBG and CBD I have heard is the most beneficial for migraine people.\n\nTerpenes are what I look for most. These are harder to find on packaging in store fronts. I order my CBD online (it is legal if it has a very tiny percentage of THC) and it is much easier to find specific terpene (and cannabinoid) information for products that way in my experience. Terpenes to look for in treating migraines are:\n\n* beta-caryophyllene: this is big for neuropathic pain (migraines)\n* myrcene: the next big one for migraines, also shows anti-anxiety relief and is commonly known as a \"couch-lock\" because its also a muscle relaxant and sleep aid\n* pinene: also is an antioxidant and potentially helps osteoarthritis! \n* limonene: also an antioxidant, anti-depressant, anti-anxiety\n* linalool: also anti-anxiety/stress, anti-depressant, but will make you sleepy!\n* borneol: helps with sleep too but is common cause of dry mouth and red eyes!\n\nI have also read that eucalyptol, delta-3-carene, and nerolidol are also beneficial terpenes for migraines but above are the main ones\n\n**What if I WANT to get high?**\n\nListen, sometimes the pain is so awful the choice is either be in pain or be high. Being high is far more fun and even if it doesn't completely take away my pain, I am in a much better mood. The day was already wasted, might as well enjoy it and relax.\n\nWhen looking at flower, most indica strains are going to be dominant in beta caryophyllene and myrcene, with the second most dominant terpenes to be limonene or a-pinene. (*however* indica v. sativa is not a great method of choosing because chemically there is no longer a difference between the two. Whether a plant is indica or sativa is chosen by the effect of the user now)\n\nOther studies have shown that hybrid strains are more preferred for migraine and headache. With OG Shark being the most loved from a survey. But I have also heard Trainwreck being a great migraine strain. I personally love AC/DC and Super Silver Haze\n\nStores are much better at listing cannabinoids nowadays than terpenes. But sometimes you can ask a budtender for the extra information of a strain that came from the provider. Going strictly off a strain name can be hard, because it can really depend between providers. You may just have to get a gram and try it out. Keeping a note on your phone about how each strain made you feel is really helpful!\n\n**Can you recommend some stuff?**\n\n[Fields of Hemp](https://fieldsofhempllc.com/) is my favorite place to get CBD flower (high CBD low THC). They include their lab testing sheets in each strain that tells you exactly the percentages of cannabinoids and terpenes. They also have a sampler pack of strains that is cheap and easy to try out different things. \n\nWhen you go into stores there will also be things like 1:1 or 20:1 which explains how much THC to CBD there is in the product. Personally I get the most relief from 1:1 products (an even amount of THC and CBD). I have yet to ever experience a high from these products. Some 1:1 products I really like are Binske and Wylde edibles, Skagit Organics vape cartridges (you need a battery for carts, unlike disposables), and GreenRevolution water solvable tinctures (they taste terrible on their own but you can mix them into drinks). I am in Washington so some of these are specific to my state, except for Wylde which I would highly recommend \n\nMy favorite CBD Full Spectrum concentrate is from Plain Jane, called [Gelato](https://plainjane.com/cbd-concentrates/) (I have heard not great things about their flower but I have never tried it, only the concentrate). It has caryophyllene, d-limonene, linalool, and beta-pinene terpenes. \n\nI vape it using my [PAX vaporizer](https://www.pax.com/vapes/categories/vaporizers). These are pricey ngl. However I have had mine for almost 10 years now. Mine specifically does flower and concentrates, using an oven instead of combustion, which is safer on your lungs and less harsh (though there is not studies done on this, i desperately wish there was, so this is my personal experience). Plus the Gelato concentrate doesn't even smell, I carry it around in my purse and nobody can tell, which is GREAT!\n\n**tldr;**\n\nthe most helpful way to use cannabis for migraines is using products that have *BOTH* THC and CBD, as they work best together. If you don't want to be high, look for Full Spectrum products. Additionally, products that have cannabinoids such as CBG, THCA, and CBC in them will be more helpful. Terpenes that are also helpful in treating migraines are primarily B-caryophyllene, myrcene, pinene, and limonene. Products that have these things in them will be more likely to help you relieve your pain and is a good place to start if you're just trying this for the first time. It does however take time, patience, and money to find something that works for you.\n\n*Sources (just a few I reference the most, highly suggest reading yourself):*\n\nBaron, “Medicinal Properties of Cannabinoids, Terpenes, and Flavonoids in Cannabis, and Benefits in Migraine, Headache, and Pain.” (this one is the most helpful imo)\n\nPoudel et al., “Medical Cannabis, Headaches, and Migraines.”\n\nCox-Georgian et al., “Therapeutic and Medicinal Uses of Terpenes.”\n\nPagano et al., “Cannabinoids.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

I have emergency joints on hand for when I get one, I usually smoke and lay down maybe also take a very light Advil and drink a lot of water. Once my vision comes back I feel a lot better it used to take 2 days to feel good again and I feel semi normal in about 2 hours after the weed and I don’t throw up which is the worst part. I also find that smoking THC Vapes don’t help my migraine attacks sometimes make them worse for some reason.",

    "body": "I have fine-textured hair with low porosity and high density and blonde highlights. It's gets oily quickly, and my skin is oily as well. My hair is normally loosely wavy (just looks messy, not nicely waved) when air-dried. Last time I was at my hairdresser's, she used the Matrix Biolage R.A.W. Color Care Conditioner with me, dried my hair slowly in a hood hair dryer and holy moley... my hair felt like butter and the waves were soooo much prettier.\n\nSo basically, my question is... based on the ingredients list of the conditioner, what was likely to have worked so well for my hair? Or do you think it was moreso the heat applied to my low-porosity hair? Just wondering if I should be on the lookout for certain ingredients in other conditioners, or whether I should keep buying RAW Color Care (It's a hassle for me to obtain).\n\nIngredients list: Aqua / Water / Eau, Cetearyl, Alcohol, Brassicamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Cocos, Nucifera Oil / Coconut Oil, Cetyl Esters, Parfum / Fragrance, Tartaric Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Salicylic Acid, Glyceryl, Stearate, Limnanthes Alba Seed Oil / Meadowfoam Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Glycerin, Linalool, Geraniol, Glycine Soja Oil / Soybean Oil, Cocos Nucifera Fruit Extract / Coconut Fruit, Extract, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate\n\nLink to conditioner: [https://chatters.ca/products/matrix-biolage-r-a-w-color-care-conditioner?variant=32581793742929&currency=CAD&utm\\_medium=product\\_sync&utm\\_source=google&utm\\_content=sag\\_organic&utm\\_campaign=sag\\_organic&gclid=Cj0KCQjwiqWHBhD2ARIsAPCDzaktZow4lzaPQeaG3mD3KSuNorpQHuRHi2hjJP7v08rgWV2Qoigc2z8aAkAcEALw\\_wcB#product\\_info](https://chatters.ca/products/matrix-biolage-r-a-w-color-care-conditioner?variant=32581793742929&currency=CAD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=Cj0KCQjwiqWHBhD2ARIsAPCDzaktZow4lzaPQeaG3mD3KSuNorpQHuRHi2hjJP7v08rgWV2Qoigc2z8aAkAcEALw_wcB#product_info)\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone!

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

It feels like a thick moisturising layer of petroleum jelly on the lips. \n\n**Colour** This variant has a pinkish tint but it’s not that visible when applied on the lips. It has a slight rosy fragrance. \n\nAfter application it looks a little shiny on the lips. Not over the top glossy. It leaves a beautiful sheen on the lips. \n\n**Thoughts** ~ The staying power is pretty good. I rarely need to reapply anything throughout the day. It keeps the lips moisturised\nthroughout the day. My lips don’t dry up easily so that’s a factor too. I didn’t notice my lips flaking or cracking up after a few hours of usage which I’ve experienced with some lip balms in order to keep reapplying them. It’s great to use this under lipstick as well. \nIf you use this at nighttime, you’ll wake up with the most beautiful and hydrated lips in the morning. 💋\nAbsolutely love this. 💕\n\nThe only drawback is the tin packaging. Looks quite aesthetic but it is a pain to open the lid. 😭 \n\n\n**Final thoughts** ~ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ \nHG will definitely repurchase. 🛍️",

    "body": "Take a second to look through these photos. Can you tell a difference between the two sides? Which is which? The answer will be in the comments.  \n\nHopefully I got enough pictures with different lighting. These are all different stages of my routine in the morning.\n\n\nSCENT:\n\nIt has been mentioned in this sub that the DT serum smells like pee. For me it has a clean, neutral scent. I would assume those were bad batches. \n\nIf I were to compare the two, I think Kérastase smells better. It also has a pleasant scent that lingers on my hair for a couple hours. DT does not linger, probably because it’s so neutral.\n\nSecond opinion: \nI asked my boyfriend to smell it too without context, he has a more sensitive nose than me. He stated that it doesn’t smell bad, I asked him if it reminded him of anything and he said it doesn’t. I told him that it smells like a clean scent to me and he agreed. \n\nThen I explained the rumor about it on Reddit and he said:\n“No, it doesn’t smell like urine. I am well acquainted” (referencing my dogs lol)\n\nSo do with that information what you will, maybe he’s just being agreeable 😂 but rest assured, you now have two more opinions on the scent. I would say to smell yours before applying to the hair just in case. I’ll update this post if there are any changes as I use it.\n\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\nDollar Tree (from the bottle):\nWATER, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, GLYCERIN, PHENOXYETHANOL, POLYQUATERNIUM-37,\nPROPYLENE GLYCOL, CYCLOHEXASILOXANE, DIMETHICONE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, PEG-20 STEARATE, STEARTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, FRAGRANCE, C13-16 ISOPARAFFIN, TRIDECETH-6 ACOHOL, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) OIL, DIMETHYL STEARANINE, HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, ARGANIA SPINOSA KERNEL OIL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, PANTHENOL\n\nKérastase (from their website):\nAqua / Water / Eau ● Dimethicone ● C13-16 Isoalkane ● Niacinamide ● Glycerin ● Polyacrylamide ● Phenoxyethanol ● C13-14 Isoalkane ● Laureth-7 ● Panthenol ● Ascorbyl Glucoside ● Butylene Glycol ● Linalool ● Hydroxycitronellal ● Benzyl Salicylate ● Benzyl Alcohol ● Hexyl Cinnamal ● Citronellol ● Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein ● Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone ● Coumarin ● Hydrolyzed Corn Protein ● Hydrolyzed Soy Protein ● Limonene ● Iris Florentina Root Extract ● Citric Acid ● Ci 19140 / Yellow 5 ● Ci 14700 / Red 4 ● Parfum / Fragrance\n\nOne notable difference in the ingredients is the addition of niacinamide in the Kérastase. Niacinamide is supposed to promote hair growth when used on the scalp. But if you are anything like me, I don’t apply serums all the way to the scalp, I start them from about the middle of my hair through the ends. \n\nBased on this, I do not believe niacinamide is especially helpful in the Kérastase. Niacinamide is probably more helpful in shampoos and scalp products (And now I’m tempted to use a certain DT niacinamide/squalane serum in my hair instead of on my face 🤣)\n\n\nPRICE:\n\nKérastase: $60/3.04 fluid oz, or $19/oz\n\nDollar Tree: $1.25/4 fluid oz, or 31¢/oz\n\n\nTEXTURE:\n\nI put these next to each other on the back of my hand. Kérastase has more of a serum feel, it’s clear/yellow upon application, and it has a little more of an oily texture. DT starts out a little thicker and looks white/creamy at first, then it blends out to be sheer. With both products, I rub them between my hands before applying to hair. \n\n\nMETHOD:\n\nLast night I did my normal shower routine, including a clarifying shampoo and a moisturizing conditioner. I’ve been using this particular duo of products for about 6 months. \n\nI let my hair dry for a couple of hours and applied one serum on each side, washing my hands between applications. Then I put my hair in braids for the night. I didn’t use any other leave-in products before taking pictures.\n\nIn the morning I took out the braids, hand-combed them, brushed through them, and then did some touch-ups to the ends with my curling iron, taking pictures throughout every step. \n\nSo let me know what you think and I’ll put my final thoughts in the comments!

Both sides of my hair look shiny and hydrated. The ends feel great. They are equally manageable. The dollar tree side MIGHT have a little more shine to it, or it could be the angle of my camera.\n\nI seriously can’t tell a difference besides the fragrance (I had to keep smelling each side to make sure I had them right) and the fragrance is not worth $58.25 to me. So you know where I’ll be spending my money.",

    "body": "EDIT: Full post with further details here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1hz62i0/after_experimentation_my_list_of_most_effective/\n\nIf you're talking about anxiety, at the outset, you need to understand key brain receptors.\n\nThe GABA-A receptor is critical for relaxation, as it mediates the inhibitory effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. This receptor is targeted by Z-drugs (e.g., Ambien), benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol to reduce anxiety, promote calm, and relax the nervous system. Supplements that act on or enhance GABA-A can deliver these effects without the risks of dependency or sedation typical of pharmaceuticals, making them ideal for daytime use when you need to stay alert yet relaxed.\n\nAdditionally, supplements often include synergistic compounds like adaptogens (e.g., holy basil) and amino acids (e.g., L-theanine) that enhance relaxation and stress management through other pathways. These combinations amplify their effects while maintaining balance and mental clarity.\n\nI am by no means a complete expert, but I've experimented with many supplements and prescription medications. Off the top of my head, these are my top recommendations for anti-anxiety supplements:\n\n\n---\n\n1. Lemon Balm Extract (Nooptronics Depot)\n\nMechanism: Mildly enhances GABA-A activity while calming the nervous system.\n\nEffects: Reduces mild anxiety, improves focus, and supports a clear-headed state under stress.\n\nWhy It’s Useful: Lemon balm’s calming effects are subtle but effective for maintaining composure during high-pressure tasks.\n\n\n\n---\n\n2. Isoliquiritigenin (Nooptronics Depot)\n\nMechanism: Potentiates GABA-A activity and provides anti-inflammatory benefits.\n\nEffects: Reduces anxiety, mental fatigue, and oxidative stress, making it ideal for sustained focus.\n\nWhy It’s Special: Highly under-the-radar, isoliquiritigenin is a potent anxiolytic and anti-fatigue agent for challenging cognitive work. This is one of my absolute favorites.\n\n\n\n---\n\n3. BaiCalm (LiftMode)\n\nMechanism: Contains baicalin, which enhances GABA-A activity, along with other calming compounds.\n\nEffects: Promotes relaxation and clarity without sedation, supporting mental productivity.\n\nWhy It Works: BaiCalm offers a balanced blend of ingredients to manage stress during a busy day. 3–4 capsules have me in a very good place, especially when mixed with lemon balm extract.\n\n\n\n---\n\n4. Source Naturals Theanine Serene with Magnesium\n\nMechanism: A combination of L-theanine (calm focus), magnesium (muscle relaxation), GABA, taurine, and holy basil extract (adaptogenic stress relief).\n\nEffects: Relieves physical tension and mental stress while improving focus and multitasking ability.\n\nWhy It Stands Out: Comprehensive blend targeting multiple relaxation pathways with potent ingredients. For the price and its strong effects, this is a real winner.\n\n\n\n---\n\n5. Baicalein (LiftMode)\n\nMechanism: Potent GABA-A enhancer derived from Chinese skullcap.\n\nEffects: Anti-anxiety and neuroprotective properties that promote focus without drowsiness.\n\nWhy It’s Effective: I buy a tub of this and mix it with a drink, and it has noticeable calming effects.\n\n\n\n---\n\n6. Valerian Root 500 mg Herbal Supplement (NOW)\n\nMechanism: Indirectly supports GABA-A activity by inhibiting GABA breakdown.\n\nEffects: Provides mild relaxation and reduces anxiety without impairing cognition.\n\nWhy It’s Unique: At lower doses, valerian root works well during the day without the sedative effects often associated with it.\n\n\n\n---\n\n7. Passion Flower Extract\n\nMechanism: Enhances GABA-A activity while also inhibiting excessive neuronal firing.\n\nEffects: Reduces overthinking, calms the mind, and promotes emotional resilience.\n\nWhy It’s Valuable: A go-to for high-pressure situations where you need to stay cool and composed.\n\n\n\n---\n\n8. Lipsanol GABA\n\nMechanism: Liposomal delivery ensures GABA crosses the blood-brain barrier effectively.\n\nEffects: Provides rapid, reliable relief from stress and anxiety.\n\nWhy It’s Potent: Its advanced delivery system makes it far more bioavailable than standard GABA supplements.\n\n\n\n---\n\n9. LILICARE GABA Supplement - 1000 mg\n\nMechanism: High-dose GABA supplement for enhanced inhibitory neurotransmitter activity.\n\nEffects: Promotes relaxation and reduces stress.\n\nWhy It’s Useful: Its simple, potent formula is ideal for noticeable results in stress reduction.\n\n\n\n---\n\n10. Quicksilver Scientific Liposomal GABA + L-Theanine\n\nMechanism: Combines the potent relaxation effects of GABA with L-theanine for focus, delivered via liposomal technology for maximum absorption.\n\nEffects: Provides near-instant stress relief and calm without sedation, functioning similarly to a mild benzodiazepine.\n\nWhy It’s Exceptional: One of the most effective natural options for benzodiazepine-like effects, albeit at a higher price point.\n\n---\n\n11. Gabatrol\n\nMechanism: Potent GABA blend designed for immediate stress relief.\n\nEffects: Outperforms traditional adaptogens like ashwagandha in reducing acute stress and anxiety.\n\nWhy It’s Superior: Its effectiveness makes it a standout option for situations demanding rapid calming effects.\n\n12. Ashwagandha (KSM-66 or Sensoril Extracts)\n\nMechanism: An adaptogen that regulates cortisol levels and promotes a balanced stress response.\n\nEffects: Reduces chronic anxiety, improves resilience to stress, and can subtly enhance mental clarity.\n\nWhy It’s Exceptional: It works well as a baseline supplement for general stress management and pairs synergistically with GABA enhancers.\n\n\n\n---\n\n13. Magnesium Glycinate or Magnesium L-Threonate\n\nMechanism: Magnesium supports the nervous system by regulating neurotransmitter activity, including GABA.\n\nEffects: Helps relieve tension, reduce anxiety, and improve sleep. Magnesium L-Threonate specifically crosses the blood-brain barrier to target cognitive function.\n\nWhy It’s Beneficial: For those with physical tension accompanying anxiety, magnesium can amplify the effects of other supplements.\n\n\n\n---\n\n14. L-Tyrosine\n\nMechanism: A precursor to dopamine and norepinephrine, which can support focus and motivation during stress.\n\nEffects: Provides a sense of mental energy and resilience during challenging tasks.\n\nWhy It’s Complementary: Balances out the relaxation-heavy effects of GABA supplements with a subtle stimulating edge.\n\n\n\n---\n\n15. Rhodiola Rosea\n\nMechanism: An adaptogen that reduces cortisol and enhances resilience to stress while boosting mental energy.\n\nEffects: Combats mental fatigue and promotes focus under pressure.\n\nWhy It’s Useful: Excellent for daytime use to pair relaxation with mental alertness.\n\n\n16.  Kava Extract (Standardized)\n\nMechanism: Acts as a direct GABA-A receptor modulator, much like benzodiazepines but without dependency risks when used correctly.\n\nEffects: Deep relaxation, reduction in anxiety, and improved mood.\n\nWhy It’s Potent: One of the strongest natural options for acute anxiety relief, though it should be used sparingly due to potential liver concerns.\n\n17. CO2 Coriander Extract (Nooptronics Depot)\n\nMechanism: Enhances GABAergic activity and provides calming effects through its rich blend of linalool and other bioactive compounds.\n\nEffects: Promotes relaxation, reduces anxiety, and offers mild mood-enhancing benefits.\n\nWhy It’s Noteworthy: Coriander extract is an excellent addition to any anti-anxiety stack, particularly for those seeking a natural way to amplify GABA’s calming effects while staying mentally sharp.\n\n---\n\nTLDR: Most Potent on GABA-A Receptors, IMO:\n\n1. Quicksilver Scientific Liposomal GABA + L-Theanine – Exceptional for rapid, benzodiazepine-like effects.\n\n\n2. Gabatrol – Reliable for immediate stress relief and calming action.\n\n\n3. Baicalein (LiftMode) – High potency for relaxation and clarity without sedation.\n\n\n4. Isoliquiritigenin – Under-the-radar but powerful for anxiety and mental clarity.\n\n\n5. Source Naturals Theanine Serene with Magnesium\n\n\n6. Lemon Balm Extract Tablets\n\n7. CO2 Coriander Extract (Nooptronics Depot)\n\n\n\n---\n\nDisclaimers:\n\n1. I did not include muscimol from the Amanita mushroom because the DEA recently issued a warning about it. Before this development, I found its effects very similar to Z-drugs (e.g., Ambien), offering significant relaxation and sleep aid benefits. Proceed with caution and stay informed about its legal status.\n\n\n2. The same disclaimer applies to Phenibut.\n\n\n3. As for RC (research chemical) benzodiazepines, I am not familiar enough to confirm their legality, which may vary under the Analog Act. Regardless, I strongly advise avoiding them. They are extremely potent and dangerous, causing delusions of sobriety, severe addiction, and a high risk of seizures or strokes.\n\n\n\n",

Looked at the ingredients and the tester had a different ingredient list than the new bright orange ones! Neither one matched my older Lust ingredients. Whereas the oils were far up the ingredients list before, they now fell behind fillers. Notably, linalool was much further up the ingredients in the new bottles.\n\nWent to another store and saw Lord of Misrule also looked different between tester and new. Remembered to take a picture this time as seen above.  Whereas patchouli oil used to be 3rd in line, it is now preceded by benzyl benzoate and water. \n\nLike many others, I have been very disappointed by Lush lately and wanted to warn others. They are still coasting on the reputation they had built, but no one should have to pay the hyper inflated prices for a figment of what these beauties used to be. ",

    "body": "As the title suggests, this is my current sunscreen collection, and I'll be reviewing the products and mentioning the ones I love and the ones I don't ! (This post might be half cooked, not very organised and all over the place, but it's my first time, so bear with me :P) \n\nSo as I mentioned, this is my first post here (eeep! :D) and initially I thought of sharing my entire shelfie, but I realised that being the junkie/hoarder I am, it'd end up being a terribly long post , hence after much deliberation I decided to post different categories of products separately  (sunscreens, moisturisers, serums etc) and after I'm done with that, I shall be making a post with only the products I use in my  current skincare routine!\n\nWithout further adieu let's get started! Please do like, share,  subscribe and don't forget to hit the bell icon!... lmao jk\n\n**Skin Type** : Oily - Combination, Comedonal Acne Prone, Rosacea Prone,\n\n**Major skin concerns** : Hypersensitivity, Non inflammatory acne, Sebum Production. \n\n**Age** : Early - Mid 20s, F\n\n**Current Climatic Conditions** : Semi- Arid, Dry winter \n\nSpecie : Homo Sapien\n\nHeight : wait.. I'm not supposed to divulge all these details! \n\n**Product reviews** :\n\n*Note* : None of these products have been used by me on a strictly daily basis, except for a week (or two) in a row during vacations, as I rarely step out of the house (lockdown, duh!) and don't apply sunscreen indoors (\\*gaasp\\* 😨)   \n Rest assured, I've reapplied some when out, and have used them on and off in a span of 6 months. \n\nFrom L-R \n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/s2C99g0N/IMG-20211119-184403.jpg\n\n\n**1-  Nivea Sun Protect And Moisture, moisturising sun and collagen protection SPF 50+ PA++++** \n\n**Quantity** **- Price** : 125 ml - ₹495 MRP\n\n(bought on Amazon for ₹396)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua, Octocrylene, Glycerin, Titanium Dioxide, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Alcohol Denat, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Panthenol, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Myristyl Myristate, Silica, Cetyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Stearyl Alcohol, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Methylparaben, Dimethicone, Trisodium EDTA, Ethylparaben, Sodium Citrate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citric Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hydroxide, Linalool, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Eugenol, Coumarin, Methyl Benzoate, Benzoic Acid, BHT, Parfum/Fragrance\n\n**Texture** : White - Chalky Color. Medium - Thick Consistency   \n , you have to rub it in for a while for it to get completely absorbed, medium drying speed. Kinda greasy, semi matte finish. Leaves a moderate white cast, not a ghastly one though. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. Smells mostly of Alcohol! (it's one of the ingredients, so obviously..), fragrance is definitely not unnoticeable, but I don't mind it for my body, lingers around for a while. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : Hell yeah! It won't wear off unless you bathe, it survives water splashes and friction from clothes. Be careful while applying it on your feet though, I slip a lot while walking, esp when there's a rush and I put on sandals right after applying it. Give it ample time to dry before stepping out. \n\n**Reapplication** : Since the lotion sits thick on the skin, reapplication is not a bliss, the white cast becomes more noticeable after reapplication, and if you sweat after, oh god it feels a heavy /sticky mess lol, also tends to attract dust, but it's for the body, so I can compromise. 🤷‍♀️\n\n**Overall experience** : It's the best body sunscreen I've tried so far, with the highest protection and I think the brand can be trusted for its spf claims. \n\nI tried using it on my face once, oh nooo, I will never do that again! it kept moving around and just wouldn't get absorbed, plus it stung like hell because of the alcohol, and I literally felt like I was applying fevicol!   \n For my body, yep a thumbs up! \n\n\\*But\\*, if you get acne on your arms  (my arms have a tendency to break out / get textured if I use the wrong product) it wouldn't be the best choice, it seals and chokes the pores, I'd prefer something lighter. I usually wear tops/suits with long sleeves, so not much of the arm is exposed. below the elbow it feels comfortable enough. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WRP**, Hit! (for the body) \n\n**2- Iba Halal Invisible Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++**   \n **Quantity - Price** : 80 ml - ₹395 MRP\n\n(I bought it on Amazon for ₹ 337)\n\n**Ingredients** : WATER CONTAINING EXTRACTS OF ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) EXTRACT & HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) WATER, WATER & ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE & BENZOPHENONE-3 & BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE & PHOSPHOLIPIDS & 1,3-BUTYLENE GLYCOL & PHENOXYETHANOL, GLYCERINE, AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/BEHENETH-25 METHACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL AND TRIETHYLENE GLYCOL, ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE, ALUMINIUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE, NIACINAMIDE (VITAMIN B3), TITANIUM DIOXIDE, PERFUME, DISODIUM EDTA, SODIUM HYDROXIDE\n\n**Texture** : White color. Light lotion - cream consistency, very lightweight and water like, kind of runny, it trickles down when you place a dallop on the palm and tilt it.   \n The Best consistency of a sunscreen I've used so far! Not at all heavy, takes some time to dry, esp when using larger amounts (I use 2-3 finger lengths) and still it doesn't feel too much on my face, easy to work with, requires a lot of gentle massaging because it's watery and takes some time to dry and settle in. High dry time.   \n It contains no silicones! My oily skin loves it! Doesn't give a matte finish though, on the glossy (satin?) side, but nothing bothersome.  \n Doesn't leave a white cast! On the Low I'd say, because of the presence of Titanium Dioxide. Absolutely love the texture. Skin feels very hydrated and plump and non greasy. (taaza nikhaar 😆) \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Has a \"fresh\" smell, (bamboo room freshener? idk something like that), moderate level, doesn't linger a lot. I haven't found a \\*good\\* fragrance free budget (\\*my\\* budget) friendly sunscreen yet. So I'm okay with this for now. Sometimes I'm guilty of enjoying the fragrance 😅 because all other products I use are strictly fragrance free. \n\n**Water Resistant?** :  Nope, doesn't survive water splashes or sweat (it won't come off completely in a single splash though, will wash off when sweating profusely) white colored droplets roll down the face if out in the sun for long. (the survival time is slightly more than the La Shield urban protection mineral sunscreen gel though) \n\n**Reapplication** : Breezy! Since it's lightweight, although, you might experience some moving around if there's a \\*lot\\* of product, I'd suggest applying pea by pea instead of taking a finger length at one go, I squeezed out a good amount once while in the car and kept massaging it in for a couple minutes (or more) and felt embarrassed at the weird looks my family and people outside the car gave me.. So yeah.. lol.  It doesn't feel uncomfortable after layers have been built up. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I love it! Although I'm not sure if the sunscreen has undergone the required tests to justify the actual sun protection claims, but that's all I got so far, it fits my requirements of no silicones, negligible white cast, high declared protection, non oily texture, and most importantly budget! \n\nOne important point, it stings when used after physical / chemical exfoliation. So you may want to avoid it after threading / waxing / scrubbing / masking / exfoliating.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Hit! **WRP** (for face) \n\n**3- La Shield Pollution Protect Mineral Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹280 MRP\n\n(bought it on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Purified Water, Octinoxate, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Caprylyl Methicone, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Diisopropyl Adipate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetearyl Alcohol, Brassica Campestris/Aleurites Fordi Oil Copolymer, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Phenoxyethanol, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, C20-22 Alcohols, Isohexadecane, Fragrances, Aluminium Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 60, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trolamine, Disodium Edetate, Sorbitan Isostearate\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Light - Medium gel - cream consistency. Lightweight. Doesn't require a lot of rubbing in. Doesn't move around a lot. Leaves a Low- Moderate white cast. Not the kind typical to mineral sunscreens, but more than the Iba Halal sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Lingers.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Naah, it melts away almost instantly if you happen to sweat while applying it, just a spray (accidental rain drop for example) on the face and it wears off from that spot, minor sweating and it rolls down the cheeks, doesn't adhere to the skin. \n\n**Reapplication** : Medium ease. Moves around, kind of sticky when built up. Medium White cast (visibly noticeable) after reapplication. \n\n**Overall Experience** : Um, I had expected a better performance from this one, looking at the ingredients and all, but it stings around the eyes, and on the face, makes my face somewhat tacky, my face becomes oily by afternoon (if applied in the morning). Personally I didn't like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Miss. **WNRP**.\n\n**4-  La Shield Fisico Matte Sunscreen Gel SPF 50+ PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹630 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹441)\n\n**Ingredients** : Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate\n\n**Texture** : White color, pasty. Very thick, \\*very\\* silicone-y (it's silicone based.. So), chokes the skin, spreadability is good, doesn't require a lot of massaging in, quick dry time. Moderate - slightly high white cast. Makes my face sweat! \n\n**Fragrance** : No. Silicone like.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Definitely. Strong staying power. Survives sweating and water splashes too well. Requires double cleanse or a heavy duty face wash to remove. \n\n**Reapplication** : Hahaha! Go ahead and try it if you want to look like a freshly frosted cake! Don't even \\*think\\* about it. Unless you plan to scare people with your literal white walker look. Been there, done that. I'm forever terrified, and will \\*never\\* do it again.\n\n**Overall Experience** : It's a thick paste, Stings around the eyes, which was surprising it being a physical sunscreen (probably because the zinc is micronized? idk) Reapplication is painful, can't apply more than 2 pea sized amount in the first application. Attracts dirt, Chokes my pores, I can't afford to apply something so pore clogging and then strip my facial skin away to remove it.   \n For me, it's not worth the price performance wise.   \n I'm finishing it off as a primer for occasions, smoothes out the face surface, my face gleamed during diwali :P\n\n**Repurchase status** : Miss! **WNRP**.\n\n**5- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Mineral Sunscreen, SPF 50+ PA++++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹295 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹236)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Silica, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Sodium Chloride, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Perfume, Magnesium Sulphate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Thick cream. Low - medium effort required for blending in the skin. Doesn't move around a lot. Medium - High Dry time. Low white cast (for a mineral sunscreen), medium matte finish. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : No, doesn't survive low- medium sweating. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I haven't used this sunscreen much. My mom used it a few times, and the moment I saw it melting down her face I didn't want to use it. Could have been a great affordable mineral sunscreen, but it's not even mildly water resistant, so I instantly passed on it. Might give it a try in the future. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WNRP**. \n\n**6- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Sunblock and Anti Tan Lotion Tinted Sunscreen, SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 60 ml - ₹245 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water,Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Propylene Glycol, Glyceryl Monostearate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Kaolin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Sodium Sulfite, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Extract, Saxifraga Sarmentosa Extract, Acetyl Tyrosine, Arbutin, Glutathione, Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dimethiconol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, Perfume, Disodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ci 77492, Ci 77491, Ci 77499\n\n**Texture** : Orange color (literally). Medium consistency lotion like. Lightweight. Medium matte finish. Easy application. Doesn't require much effort to blend in. But the color is a literal disaster, it's impossible to apply a full finger length of this sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. On the Higher side. \n\n**Water Resistant** : Maybe a bit more than the mineral sunscreen variant? Not sure, rubs off on the mask \\*very\\* readily. Haven't noticed orange sweat yet, maybe because I haven't worn it enough. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. But I'm pretty sure it's not possible provided the intense color. \n\n**Overall Experience** : It could have been a good,  affordable tinted sunscreen, but the tint is just a disaster.. It dulls my face overall, and it doesn't even work as a bb cream (or sorts) although I don't expect to provide any coverage as per se (which it doesn't anyhow), but I can't find a way to finish it off other than applying it on my hands. Maybe color corrector?? Omg what'd I just come up with 😃💡. Let's see lol \n\n**Repurchase status** : Nope. **WNRP**. \n\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/RVccCB01/IMG-20211119-173651.jpg\n\n**7-** **Malibu LipCare Balm, SPF 30, UVA/UVB** (watermelon variant) \n\n**Quantity - Price** : 5 gm - ₹249-₹299\n\n(bought 2 on amazon for ₹199 each )\n\n**Ingredients** (watermelon) : Petrolatum, Paraffinum Liquidum (Mineral Oil), Paraffin Wax, Ozokerite Wax, Homosalate, Octocrylene, Carnauba Wax, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Flavor  \n May Contain: Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Citral, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol\n\n**Texture** : Ultra Rich, stiff stick, application is not smooth and breezy, tugs and pulls on the lips if you rush it, tightly press it against the surface, let the balm melt and glide on slowly. Makes lips very soft though. Staying power is great! \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Watermelon. Strong. \n\n**Taste** : Bitter Af! Avoid applying it on the insides and corners to keep it from seeping in. \n\n**Water resistant?** : Definitely! Survives liquids (tea, water, juice for me) not very heavy meals. Apply a thick layer to fight the mask rubbing off. Stays on for hours, afternoon - evening, for example. Keeps lips very soft and supple, no stinging sensation. \n\n**Overall Experience** : The only lip balm with spf 30 (plus uva/uvb protection) that has all the ingredients disclosed. Can't ask for more.   \n The only issue is, I can't use it with my waterproof /transferproof matte lipsticks. It makes them water loving and easily transferable, need to figure something out for that.. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : Unless I find some other lip balm with spf 30 mentioning all the ingredients, in a more affordable range, with no bitter taste, and better sunscreen filters. I **WRP** this. \n\nThats about it! Congrats for making it this far! Thanks!\n\n*Edited to add links to images, since I couldn't upload them with the post*",

    "body": "First of all, these are a list of products available in Boots that I've found, so they're non-exhaustive. Apart from some Neutrogena products and No7 Beautiful Skin Blemish Defence Serum, they contain \"alcohol denat.\", which is a dealbreaker for me as I try to avoid drying alcohols as much as I can. \n\nBHAs are few and very far in between, in addition to not being labelled as such and most probably without the percentage of salicylic acid contained or whether it's in the right pH to be effective. \n\nI haven't done a price comparison, and since I found them in Boots I've used the online site's price point. Prices are only as a guide, they may be cheaper/more expensive elsewhere. Ingredients are highlighted to point out the position of salicylic acid, as well as presence of drying alcohols and parfum for those irritated by them. \n\nAdditional suggestions, opinions and reviews are very welcome!\n\n* PRODUCT: Boots Skin Clear Deep Blackhead Cleansing Lotion\n\nPRICE: £2.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua (Water), **Alcohol denat.**, **Salicylic acid**, PPG-1-PEG-9 lauryl glycol ether, Butylene glycol, Potassium hydroxide, Ammonium glycyrrhizate, **Parfum (Fragrance)**, Dipropylene glycol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Deep Cleansing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.29 for 65 exfoliating pads\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat., Salicylic Acid,** Isoceteth-20, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Hydroxide, Triethanolamine, Allantoin, **Parfum**, **Menthol**, Benzyl Salicylate, Disodium EDTA, Limonene, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Pads\n\nPRICE: 5.39 for 65 pads\n\nINGREDIENTS:Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, **Salicylic Acid**, Hydrogen Peroxide, **Parfum**, Sodium Hydroxide, Dextrin, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Superfruits Refreshing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.07\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, Glycerin, **Salicylic Acid**, **Parfum**, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Sodium Hydroxide, Propylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Limonene, Citronellol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Hexyl Cinnamal, Rubus Idaeus Juice, Trideceth-9, Vaccinium Macrocarpon Fruit Juice, Geraniol, Bisabolol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Garnier Pure Active line (various)\n\nPRICE: from £4.99 to £7.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: I can't find an ingredients list anywhere, which is frustrating but as a guide, I remember putting all the Garnier products down because they contain \"Alcohol Denat.\" The packaging lists 2% salicylic acid. No info on pH level. \n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: No7 Beautiful Skin Blemish Defence Serum\n\nPRICE: £16.00\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua (Water), Glycerin, **Salix Nigra (Willow) Bark Extract**, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Citric Acid, Butylene Glycol, Propylene Glycol, Methylparaben, Sodium Citrate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Lupinus Albus Seed Extract, Tetrasodium EDTA, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, Butylparaben, Ethylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Propylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7.\n\nNOTE: As far as I know, willowback extract works as a weaker form of salicylic acid, so I really can't comment on whether there's enough of it to be effective (or if it's in the right pH!), but hey, no alcohols as far as I can see! \n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: No7 Beautiful Skin Pore Minimising Serum\n\nPRICE: £16.00\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua(Water), **Alcohol denat.**, Cyclopentasiloxane, Glycerin, HDI/trimethylol hexyliactone cross polymer, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, Dimethicone crosspolymer, Octyldodecanol, Acrylamide/ammonium acrylate copolymer, **Alcohol, Salicylic acid**, Butylene glycol, Polyisobutene, Phenoxyethanol, PEG-30 dipolyhydroxtstearate, Octyldodecylxyloside, Hamamelis virginiana (Witch hazel) water, **Parfum (Fragrance)**, Lens esculenta fruit extract, Sodium PCA, Tocopheryl acetate, Retinyl palmitate, Sorbitan isostearate, Polysorbate 20, Ascorbyl glucoside, Silica, Tetrasodium EDTA, Magnesium PCA, Dipropylene glycol, Spiraea ulmaria extract, Zinc PCA, Potassium hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Manganese PCA, Potassium sorbate, Tocopherol.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Neutrogena Visibly Clear Oil-Free Moisturiser\n\nPRICE: £4.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, Propylene Glycol, Clycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, **Salicylic Acid**, AloeBarbadensis, Chamomilla Recutita, Menthyl Lactate, Glyceryl Stearate, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, PEG-100 Stearate, Sodium Isostearoyl Lactylate, Propylene Glycol Isostearate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Carbomer, Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Probylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, **Parfum**.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Neutrogena Visibly Clear Spot Stress Control 3-in-1 Daily Cleansing Lotion\n\nPRICE: £3.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Butylene Glycol, **Salicylic Acid**, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract, Cucumis Sativus Fruit Extract, C12-15 Alkyl Lactate, Cetyl Lactate, Glycerin, Potassium Lactate, **Isopropyl Alcohol**, Sodium Benzotriazolyl Butylphenol Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Sodium Citrate, Lactic Acid, Sodium Chloride, Disodium EDTA, Benzalkonium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, **Parfum**, Cl 17200, Cl 19140, Cl 42090.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Neutrogena VISIBLY CLEAR Blackhead Eliminating Cleansing Lotion\n\nPRICE: £3.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, Glycerin, **Salicylic Acid**, Menthyl Lactate, **Parfum**\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Neutrogena VISIBLY CLEAR Pink Grapefruit Oil-Free Moisturiser\n\nPRICE: £4.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Cetyl Alcohol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Stearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, **Salicylic Acid**, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Cetyl Lactate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, C12-15 Alkyl Lactate, Dimethicone, Sodium Isostearoyl Lactylate, Propylene Glycol Isostearate, **Alcohol Denat.**, **Isopropyl Alcohol**, Myristyl Alcohol, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Chloride, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Lactic Acid, Benzalkonium Chloride, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, **Parfum**.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Neutrogena Visibly Clear Spot Stress Control Hydrating Spot Treatment (note: currently using this as my BHA, tell me if you want a review.

        "body": "It wasn't till I started reading this subreddit that I realised that I probably should ease off the scrubbing and look into chemical exfoliation so I went back to an old bottle of *Neutrogena Visibly Clear Spot Stress Control 3-in-1 Daily Cleansing Lotion* that I had. While I could see the improvements, it would feel like my skin was burning. I'm not sure if it's due to the age of the bottle, or just the ingredients, but I discontinued use.\n\nThen I bought *Boots Skin Clear Deep Cleansing Lotion* which is exactly the same as the Blackhead version just with an extra word on the front.

Initially, THC garnered most research interest with sporadic attention to cannabidiol, which has only rekindled in the last 15 years through a demonstration of its remarkably versatile pharmacology and synergy with THC. Gradually a cognizance of the potential of other phytocannabinoids has developed. Contemporaneous assessment of cannabis pharmacology must be even far more inclusive. Medical and recreational consumers alike have long believed in unique attributes of certain cannabis chemovars despite their similarity in cannabinoid profiles. This has focused additional research on the pharmacological contributions of mono- and sesquiterpenoids to the effects of cannabis flower preparations. Investigation reveals these aromatic compounds to contribute modulatory and therapeutic roles in the cannabis entourage far beyond expectations considering their modest concentrations in the plant. Synergistic relationships of the terpenoids to cannabinoids will be highlighted and include many complementary roles to boost therapeutic efficacy in treatment of pain, psychiatric disorders, cancer, and numerous other areas. Additional parts of the cannabis plant provide a wide and distinct variety of other compounds of pharmacological interest, including the triterpenoid friedelin from the roots, canniprene from the fan leaves, cannabisin from seed coats, and cannflavin A from seed sprouts. This chapter will explore the unique attributes of these agents and demonstrate how cannabis may yet fulfil its potential as Mechoulam's professed “pharmacological treasure trove.”*\n\n[Free PDF version. ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317354478_Cannabis_Pharmacology_The_Usual_Suspects_and_a_Few_Promising_Leads)\n\n**Video: The Pharmacology of Cannabis Cannabinoids and Terpenes by Dr Ethan Russo**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3rJoiPN\\_6k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3rJoiPN_6k)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Health Effects of Cannabis and Cannabinoids: The Current State of Evidence and Recommendations for Research**\n\n**\\~**  National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine \n\n*Significant changes have taken place in the policy landscape surrounding cannabis legalization, production, and use. During the past 20 years, 25 states and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis and/or cannabidiol (a component of cannabis) for medical conditions or retail sales at the state level and 4 states have legalized both the medical and recreational use of cannabis. These landmark changes in policy have impacted cannabis use patterns and perceived levels of risk. However, despite this changing landscape, evidence regarding the short- and long-term health effects of cannabis use remains elusive. While a myriad of studies have examined cannabis use in all its various forms, often these research conclusions are not appropriately synthesized, translated for, or communicated to policy makers, health care providers, state health officials, or other stakeholders who have been charged with influencing and enacting policies, procedures, and laws related to cannabis use. Unlike other controlled substances such as alcohol or tobacco, no accepted standards for safe use or appropriate dose are available to help guide individuals as they make choices regarding the issues of if, when, where, and how to use cannabis safely and, in regard to therapeutic uses, effectively. Shifting public sentiment, conflicting and impeded scientific research, and legislative battles have fueled the debate about what, if any, harms or benefits can be attributed to the use of cannabis or its derivatives, and this lack of aggregated knowledge has broad public health implications. The Health Effects of Cannabis and Cannabinoids provides a comprehensive review of scientific evidence related to the health effects and potential therapeutic benefits of cannabis. This report provides a research agenda \"outlining gaps in current knowledge and opportunities for providing additional insight into these issues \"that summarizes and prioritizes pressing research needs.*\n\n[Buy hardback/paperback version](https://amzn.to/2VfvXVU)\n\n[Free PDF version ](https://download.nap.edu/cart/download.cgi?record_id=24625)\n\n[Video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtqoYwvPoY)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cannabinoid Pharmacology**\n\n*Cannabinoid Pharmacology, Volume 80 is a new volume in the Advances in Pharmacology that presents reviews of recent breakthroughs.

These past years provided a remarkable and constant number of breakthroughs, showing that the signaling mediated by endocannabinoids and lipid mediators impacts almost every function of the body. Indeed, this represents a special field of research, which allows tackling the complexity of biological functions, and provides potential therapeutic frameworks for a plethora of diseases. The number of exciting discoveries brought up to the scientific community almost on a daily basis highlights the importance of an updated volume on this topic. Particularly, given that potential therapeutic benefits of cannabis and cannabinoids are currently under heavy analysis in many Countries worldwide. Hence, the main objective of this book is to explore not only some of the many functions of endocannabinoids (and lipid mediators) in physiological control of networks at a cellular and molecular level, but also to extend this knowledge for potential use of cannabinoids and/or drugs regulating endocannabinoid levels in vivo as therapeutic target(s) in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this book new findings and ideas about the endocannabinoid system and its roles as neuronal circuit modulator related to human brain pathologies characterized by alterations in neuroplasticity will be highlighted. Endocannabinoid roles in key systems controlling appetite, pain, learning and memory, as well as sleep and stress responses will be presented. In addition, pathological processes associated with changes in endocannabinoid signaling will be discussed in the context of anxiety, autism, depression and addiction. This book will provide an excellent background to researchers looking for extending their areas of interest, and to newcomers in the field.*\n\n[Buy hardback/paperback/kindle version her](https://amzn.to/2GGLWJp)e\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cannabinoids and Their Receptors (Methods in Enzymology Book 593)**\n\n\\~  Patricia H.

(Family: Cannabaceae) is one of the oldest sources of fiber, food and medicine. This plant has been of interest to researchers, general public and media not only due to its medicinal properties but also the controversy surrounding its illicit use. Cannabis has a long history of medicinal use in the Middle East and Asia, being first introduced as a medicine in Western Europe in the early 19th century. Due to its numerous natural constituents, Cannabis is considered a chemically complex species. It contains a unique class of terpeno-phenolic compounds (cannabinoids or phytocannabinoids), which have been extensively studied since the discovery of the chemical structure of tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), commonly known as THC, the main constituent responsible for the plant’s psychoactive effects. An additionally important cannabinoid of current interest is Cannabidiol (CBD). There has been a significant interest in CBD and CBD oil (extract of CBD rich Cannabis) over the last few years because of its reported activity as an antiepileptic agent, particularly its potential use in the treatment of intractable epilepsy in children.*\n\n[Buy hardback/paperback/kindle version here](https://amzn.to/2U0R6Da)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Endocannabinoid System in Local and Systemic Inflammation**\n\n**\\~** Melanie E. M. Kelly et al\n\n*This book focuses on the role of the endocannabinoid system in local and systemic inflammation, with individual chapters written by experts in the field of cannabinoid research and medicine. The topics explore the actions of the endocannabinoid system on the immune system, including neuroinflammation in autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis, and in neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's and Alzheimer's, as well as local and systemic inflammatory conditions affecting organs including the eye (uveitis and corneal inflammation), the bladder (interstitial cystitis), pancreas (diabetes), cardiovascular system (stroke), joints (arthritis), and sepsis. The objective of this book is to provide knowledge transfer on the use of cannabinoids in inflammatory disease by critically examining preclinical and clinical research on the immunomodulatory actions of the endocannabinoid system, with specific emphasis on the actions of cannabinoids in diseases where inflammation is a prominent component. By drawing these results together, we seek to provide further understanding of the complexities of endocannabinoid system modulation of immune function and identify potential uses and limitations for cannabinoid-based therapeutics.*\n\n[Buy hardback/paperback version here](https://amzn.to/2V8BKga)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2016 \n\n**Handbook of Cannabis**\n\n\\~ Roger Pertwee \n\n*Truly global in scope and with contributions from leading researchers around the world, The Handbook of Cannabis is the definitive resource on this fascinating drug. Combining scientific perspectives and clinical applications, it covers a vast array of topics, from why over the centuries cannabis has been used as a medicine, through the regulations facing those wishing to self-administer cannabis or provide cannabis-based medicines, to the chemical structure of its many constituents and the rapidly growing group of synthetic cannabinoids that are currently being used for 'legal highs'.*\n\n*With each chapter written by a group of one or more internationally recognised subject experts, it provides academics and researchers with authoritative scientific material on the main pharmacological actions and their effects, as well as their pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and forensic detection. In addition it also examines the complex morphology, cultivation, harvesting, and processing of cannabis and the ways in which the plant's chemical composition can be controlled.*\n\n*As well as offering a raft of scientific information there is extensive coverage of cannabinoid-based medicines. Helping readers to identify and evaluate their benefits, chapters explore pharmacological actions and the effects that seem to underlie approved therapeutic uses, how they are currently used to treat certain disorders, and the ever-growing number of wide-ranging potential clinical applications. There is also coverage of both the legal and illegal sources of cannabis, including 'coffee shops' and 'cannabis dispensaries'.*\n\n*The complex issue of 'recreational cannabis' is also tackled. The sought-after and adverse psychological and non-psychological effects are described and discussions are included on how some adverse effects can be lessened by at least one constituent of cannabis, and that it might be possible to reduce the harm that cannabis does to some by changing current regulatory policies.*\n\n*The Handbook of Cannabis is a one-stop reference; essential reading for all clinicians, pharmacologists, psychologists, and psychiatrists interested in this drug, as well as those working in the field of public health.*\n\n[Buy hardback/paperback/kindle version here](https://amzn.to/2E2V6wd)\n\n[Free PDF version](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Oliver_Kayser/project/Studies-on-Cannabis-sativa-and-Cannabinoids/attachment/58985a4e934940fcce445c68/AS:458723438141442@1486379598327/download/Handbook_Cannabis.pdf?context=ProjectUpdatesLog)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Marijuana and Mental Health**\n\n\\~  Michael T. Compton\n\n*Even while many American states have passed legislation pertaining to medical marijuana and others have decriminalized or even legalised recreational use, a debate continues within society as to whether marijuana is simply a harmless substance that should be fully legalised, a possibly beneficial treatment for patients with certain illnesses, or a drug with the potential to worsen addiction and cause mental health problems. The controversy persists in the medical community as well, where accumulating evidence implicates cannabis use, especially in adolescence, as a risk factor for poor educational achievement and substance use disorders, as well as schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, all of which complicates the heated discourse on legalisation.*\n\n*Although other books have explored the medical cannabis and the neuroscience behind cannabis, no single source of comprehensive information on cannabis and mental health has existed to date. Balanced, focused, and highly readable, Marijuana and Mental Health fills this void. It provides an academic foundation for further study while also informing clinical mental health practice as well as policy decisions by articulating the connection between cannabis and mental health.*\n\n*Relatable clinical vignettes that contextualize these issues and illustrate the clinical applicability of the content, as well as key chapter points that emphasise major takeaways, make Marijuana and Mental Health the authoritative reference for clinical and research psychiatrists, psychiatric trainees and fellows, clinical psychologists, and psychiatric nurses.*\n\n[Buy paperback version here](https://amzn.to/2Vee35X)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2015\n\n**Cannabinoids in Neurologic and Mental Disease**\n\n\\~  Liana Fattore\n\n*The application of cannabis sativa for the treatment of neurologic and mental disease is expanding.

In the brain, endocannabinoids regulate ion channel activity and neurotransmitter release and thereby contribute to various aspects of brain function, including memory, reward and emotions. Their ability to modulate synaptic efficacy has a wide range of functional consequences and provides unique therapeutic possibilities. Unprecedented advances have been made in the understanding of the role of endocannabinoids in the regulation of the emotional brain over the past few years. However, a comprehensive book encompassing all these aspects is still lacking. The book will provide an overview of the role played by the endocannabinoid system in the regulation of emotional processes with particular emphasis on the modulation of memory and reward for emotionally arousing events and for the regulation of motivational aspects in cannabis use.*\n\n[Buy hardback/paperback/kindle version her](https://amzn.to/2EoEcK3)e\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2013 \n\n**The Therapeutic Potential of Marihuana**\n\n\\~  Sidney Cohen\n\n*Scientific information about cannabis and its components has grown exponentially during the past decade. Certain of the findings have led to exploratory studies into the therapeutic utility of the drug. At the present time, a number of areas of usefulness have been investigated, with some showing greater promise than others. At what point should these data be collected and presented? Should it be early, after some initial impressions have been obtained? Or should it come later, following confirmatory studies by others? Both stages of development are represented in this volume. In a number of instances, the papers consist of hitherto unpublished material. It seemed worthwhile to bring together the investigators working in a wide variety of disciplines who had in common their research activities in the therapeutic aspects of the cannabinoids and related synthetic compounds. This was done at the Asilomar Conference Center in Pacific Grove, California during November, 1975. The papers presented and the ensuing discussion constitute the contents of this volume. It is the Editors' hope that the book will stimulate further involvement in the therapeutic studies. It should not be expected, nor is it anticipated that some cannabinoid will be available commercially in the near future. The nature of the approval process is such that years elapse between initial testing, however promising, and final approval for marketing. This is particularly true for a completely new chemical entity, and even more so for one with a checkered reputation.*\n\n[Buy hardback/paperback version here](https://amzn.to/2GG4PMP)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2011 \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Taming THC: potential cannabis synergy and phytocannabinoid-terpenoid entourage effects**\n\n\\~ Ethan Russo\n\n*Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has been the primary focus of cannabis research since 1964, when Raphael Mechoulam isolated and synthesized it. More recently, the synergistic contributions of cannabidiol to cannabis pharmacology and analgesia have been scientifically demonstrated. Other phytocannabinoids, including tetrahydrocannabivarin, cannabigerol and cannabichromene, exert additional effects of therapeutic interest. Innovative conventional plant breeding has yielded cannabis chemotypes expressing high titres of each component for future study. This review will explore another echelon of phytotherapeutic agents, the cannabis terpenoids: limonene, myrcene, α-pinene, linalool, β-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide, nerolidol and phytol. Terpenoids share a precursor with phytocannabinoids, and are all flavour and fragrance components common to human diets that have been designated Generally Recognized as Safe by the US Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies. Terpenoids are quite potent, and affect animal and even human behaviour when inhaled from ambient air at serum levels in the single digits ng·mL−1. They display unique therapeutic effects that may contribute meaningfully to the entourage effects of cannabis-based medicinal extracts. Particular focus will be placed on phytocannabinoid-terpenoid interactions that could produce synergy with respect to treatment of pain, inflammation, depression, anxiety, addiction, epilepsy, cancer, fungal and bacterial infections (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Scientific evidence is presented for non-cannabinoid plant components as putative antidotes to intoxicating effects of THC that could increase its therapeutic index. Methods for investigating entourage effects in future experiments will be proposed. Phytocannabinoid-terpenoid synergy, if proven, increases the likelihood that an extensive pipeline of new therapeutic products is possible from this venerable plant.*\n\n[Read online version](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3165946/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2009 \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Cannabinoid Receptors**\n\n\\~ Patricia H.

ElSohly \n\n*Although primarily used today as one of the most prevalent illicit leisure drugs, the use of Cannabis sativa L., commonly referred to as marijuana, for medicinal purposes has been reported for more than 5000 years. Marijuana use has been shown to create numerous health problems, and, consequently, the expanding use beyond medical purposes into recreational use (abuse) resulted in control of the drug through international treaties. Much research has been carried out over the past few decades following the identification of the chemical structure of THC in 1964. The purpose of Marijuana and the Cannabinoids is to present in a single volume the comprehensive knowledge and experience of renowned researchers and scientists. Each chapter is written independently by an expert in his/her field of endeavor, ranging from the botany, the constituents, the chemistry and pharmacokinetics, the effects and consequences of illicit use on the human body, to the therapeutic potential of the cannabinoids.*\n\n[Buy hardback/paperback/kindle version here](https://amzn.to/2SVqeYH)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2005 \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cannabinoids as Therapeutics**\n\n\\~  Raphael Mechoulam\n\n*Only a few years ago the endocannabinoid system was unknown.

It summarizes the actions of the endocannabinoids on various physiological systems and opens new therapeutic windows to a large number of diseases.*\n\n*The first chapter, on the use of Cannabis in India, can be viewed as an expression of thanks to the herbal practitioners, who for centuries passed on the medical traditions associated with the drug. The chapter on chemistry is a short summary of active plant, synthetic and endogenous cannabinoids being investigated today, many of which are mentioned later in the book. Cannabidiol is an unusual cannabinoid - it does not bind to the known receptors and yet exerts a variety of effects. Hence a chapter is devoted to it. Further chapters deal with the endocannabinoid system and the endocannabinoids in a variety of conditions and physiological systems. The concluding chapter describes the research done on Sativex®, a standardized plant extract, shortly to be introduced in Canada as a drug for multiple sclerosis.*\n\n*The intended audience is drug researchers (medicinal chemists, pharmacologists, clinicians), neuroscientists, physiologists, and clinicians interested in the effect of the endocannabinoid system in various physiological systems.*\n\n[Buy hardcover version here](https://amzn.to/2EplK3L)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Marijuana and Cannabinoid Research: Methods and Protocols (Methods in Molecular Medicine)**\n\n\\~ Emmanuel S.

Cannabis and Cannabinoids: Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Therapeutic Potential features fair, equitable discussion of this emerging and controversial medical topic by the world’s foremost researchers.*\n\n*Cannabis and Cannabinoids examines the benefits, drawbacks, and side effects of medical marijuana as a treatment for various conditions and diseases. This book discusses the scientific basis for marijuana’s use in cases of pain, nausea, anorexia, and cachexia. It also explores its possible benefits in glaucoma, ischemia, spastic disorders, and migraine.*\n\n*Cannabis and Cannabinoids examines all facets of the medical use of marijuana, including:*\n\n* *botany*\n* *history*\n* *biochemistry*\n* *pharmacology*\n* *clinical use*\n* *toxicology*\n* *side effectsCannabis and Cannabinoids is a reference work that will become indispensable to physicians, psychologists, researchers, biochemists, graduate students, and interested members of the public.

Can marijuana ease their symptoms? Would it be breaking the law to turn to marijuana as a medication? There are few sources of objective, scientifically sound advice for people in this situation. Most books about marijuana and medicine attempt to promote the views of advocates or opponents. To fill the gap between these extremes, authors Alison Mack and Janet Joy have extracted critical findings from a recent Institute of Medicine study on this important issue, interpreting them for a general audience. Marijuana As Medicine? provides patients--as well as the people who care for them--with a foundation for making decisions about their own health care. This empowering volume examines several key points, including: \\* Whether marijuana can relieve a variety of symptoms, including pain, muscle spasticity, nausea, and appetite loss. \\* The dangers of smoking marijuana, as well as the effects of its active chemical components on the immune system and on psychological health. \\* The potential use of marijuana-based medications on symptoms of AIDS, cancer, multiple sclerosis, and several other specific disorders, in comparison with existing treatments. Marijuana As Medicine? introduces readers to the active compounds in marijuana. These include the principal ingredient in Marinol, a legal medication. The authors also discuss the prospects for developing other drugs derived from marijuana's active ingredients. In addition to providing an up-to-date review of the science behind the medical marijuana debate, Mack and Joy also answer common questions about the legal status of marijuana, explaining the conflict between state and federal law regarding its medical use. Intended primarily as an aid to patients and caregivers, this book objectively presents critical information so that it can be used to make responsible health care decisions. Marijuana As Medicine? will also be a valuable resource for policymakers, health care providers, patient counselors, medical faculty and students--in short, anyone who wants to learn more about this important issue.*\n\n[Buy in paperback version here](https://amzn.to/2VftiM5)\n\n[Free PDF version](https://www.nap.edu/login.php?record_id=9586&page=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nap.edu%2Fdownload%2F9586)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1999 \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base**\n\n\\~ Institute of Medicine\n\n*The medical use of marijuana is surrounded by a cloud of social, political, and religious controversy, which obscures the facts that should be considered in the debate. This book summarizes what we know about marijuana from evidence-based medicine--the harm it may do and the relief it may bring to patients. The book helps the reader understand not only what science has to say about medical marijuana but also the logic behind the scientific conclusions. Marijuana and Medicine addresses the science base and the therapeutic effects of marijuana use for medical conditions such as glaucoma and multiple sclerosis. It covers marijuana's mechanism of action, acute and chronic effects on health and behavior, potential adverse effects, efficacy of different delivery systems, analysis of the data about marijuana as a gateway drug, and the prospects for developing cannabinoid drugs. The book evaluates how well marijuana meets accepted standards for medicine and considers the conclusions of other blue-ribbon panels. Full of useful facts, this volume will be important to anyone interested in informed debate about the medical use of marijuana: advocates and opponents as well as policymakers, regulators, and health care providers.*\n\n[Buy hard cover version here](https://amzn.to/2Sn7Hj0)\n\n[Free PDF version ](https://download.nap.edu/cart/download.cgi?record_id=6376)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1997 \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Therapeutic Uses of Cannabis**\n\n\\~  British Medical Association\n\n*At the last Annual Representative Meeting of the British Medical Association a motion was passed that \\`certain additional cannabinoids should be legalized for wider medicinal use.'' This report supports this landmark statement by reviewing the scientific evidence for the therapeutic use of cannabinoids and sets the agenda for change. It will be welcomed by those who believe that cannabinoids can be used in medical treatment. The report discusses in a clear and readable form the use and adverse effects of the drug for nausea, multiple sclerosis, pain, epilepsy, glaucoma, and asthma.*\n\n[Buy hardback/paperback version here](https://amzn.to/2SV8EEn)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1984\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Cannabinoids: Chemical, Pharmacologic, and Therapeutic Aspects**\n\n\\~ Stig Agurell\n\n*The Cannabinoids: Chemical, Pharmacologic, and Therapeutic Aspects provides a comprehensive discussion of the various aspects of cannabis and its constituents.*\n\n*The book is organized into six sections. Section I covers the clinical aspects of cannabis including the health aspects, impact on memory function, and the characteristics and treatment of marijuana abusers. Section II on chemical aspects includes studies on the chemistry and structure-activity relationships of cannabinoids; smoking characteristics of marijuana cigarettes; and developments in cannabinoid analyses of body fluids. Section III on metabolic and pharmacokinetic aspects includes studies on the metabolism, disposition, and pharmacokinetics of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in men and women; single dose kinetics of cannabidiol in man; and distribution and disposition of THC in different tissues of the rat.*\n\n*Section IV on reproductive aspects include studies on the effects of chronic administration of THC on the early embryonic development of mice; effects of cannabinoids on spermatogenesis in mice; and possible mechanism for the cellular effects of marijuana on male reproductive function. Section V on neuropharmacologic aspects includes studies on the discriminative stimulus properties of THC and the effects of cannabinoids on neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. Section VI on therapeutic aspects includes studies such as the possible anxiolytic effects of cannabidiol; tetrahydrocannabinol effects on extrapyramidal motor behaviors in Parkinson's disease; and the use of cannabinoids in glaucoma.*\n\n[Buy in hardback/kindle version here](https://amzn.to/2GGuO6y)",

    "body": "The vast majority of lavender notes provided by indie fragrances will be made using either one or a mix of multiple essential oils or absolutes. I have smelled several lavenders and here are my thoughts on each so you know which perfumes you might like and which ones you might hate.\n\n- Lavender Fleurs (Supplier: Perfumer’s Apprentice; produced by ROBERTET. Country: France) \n\nThis is a lemon-forward lavender with an herbal compliment on the front end. As the smell dissipates in your nose, a soft floral can be smelled on the exhale. This is a delicate and true to form lavender.\n\n- Lavender Diva (Supplier: Perfumer’s Apprentice. Country: France)\n\nThis is a fatty, almost plastic smelling floral. There is a soft lemony herbalness in the distance. This one is pretty unique in terms of smell. Perfumer’s Apprentice describes it as linear and not as complex as other lavenders. I would agree with that. There are few layers to this oil. The plasticy floral masks the more complex herbal background.\n\n- Lavender France (Supplier: Eden Botanicals. Country: France)\n\n\nAgain, a fatty opening but without the plasticy note. Similar to the fattiness of fresh mown hay. The front is mostly floral with a bit of a fresh grassy green herbal note. Less bitingly strong and lemony than the herbal components of other lavenders. This one is mostly floral and soft.\n\n- Lavender Bulgaria (Supplier: Eden Botanicals. Country: Bulgaria) \n\nThe opening to this one is sweet like raisins. On the back end of the opening there’s a citrusy smell that’s not quite lemon. More like an oxidized plum. The fatty raisin component follows down to the base, where a dry grass-like herbal note lies. Pleasantly fruity and floral with a fit of dried herbs overall.\n\n- Lavender Maillette (Supplier: Eden Botanicals Country: France)\n\nThe opening to this one is a clean fresh herbal note. The purest herbal lavender note that exists in my collection. There is a pleasant and soft floral on the back. The journey for this one is a nice smooth ride. Smelling it actually made me a little tired. A good one to place in the diffuser at night. In perfume, it is unlikely to add any nasty or unexpected notes.\n\n- Lavender Spike (Supplier: Eden Botanicals. Country: Spain)\n\nThis is the most common Lavender sold for EO diffusers according to the internet. This is why some might get the impression that lavender is astringent. This is very astringent lavender. The front end is a cold, almost eucalyptus and cypress needle like smell. On the back end, it smells a bit like lemon based cleaning chemicals. Could definitely cause a headache or two. This is probably my least favorite to work with. At smaller dilutions, it goes well in fougère type fragrances.\n\n- Lavender 40/42 (Supplier: Perfumer’s Apprentice)\n\nThis is a partially synthetic lavender made from 40% lavandin Grosso and 42% lavender France. Linalool and Linalyl acetate make up the rest. This is the definitive lavender smell used in many standardized fragrances. If you’re looking for purity and standardization, this is the one. This lavender contains some spike lavender from the Grosso blend so it has the strong cooling herbal component in the background while florals  dominate the overall composition.",

Companies state that it creates a \"luxury experience\" but I think this idea is terribly outdated and excludes those who are fragrance sensitive. Adding pleasing smells to get people to use what might otherwise be a lackluster product is really manipulative.\n\nThe origin hardly matters when many of the essential oils used can increase photosensitivity or are allergens in their own right (lavender, for example). People who love fragrance can add lotions or perfumes to their own routine that are specifically about that sensory experience. If it is skincsre or fragrance, all that matters to me is that it accomplishes its task well.\n\nThe worst is when they try to justify the use of a fragrant plant oil saying it has properties good for skin, when those good properties can be gotten from other efficacious, less irritating ingredients that won't photosensitize the skin or cause allergix flare-ups.",

    "body": "**TL;DR: Don't fuck up like me. Make sure your moisturizer, primer, and foundation all have the same base or you will regret it.** \n\nOk, I know that this topic has come up a lot recently, but I feel like a lot of discussions leave out a key part of the problem. By now, I think most people know that you have to make sure your primer and foundation have the same base i.e. are they water based or silicone based. It makes sense since those two are layered one on top of the other and if they're immiscible then the foundation will just settle on top and come off on everything, defeating the purpose of a primer. Now, what I haven't seen discussed is how your moisturizer may be interacting with your primer and foundation. I've discovered some interesting things through trial and error recently and wanted to share it with the MUA community.\n\nFirst, I recently switched moisturizers. My skin has been a disaster this winter and I needed a major skincare overhaul. I have sensitive skin and Neutrogena has always had my back with great products that don't irritate my skin. One of the new things I got was a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, the [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/hydro+boost+water+gel.do?sortby=ourPicks). I love this product because it absorbs quickly, eliminated my dry spots, and hasn't caused any irritation. What I didn't take into account when I bought this product was the ingredients list; I was just happy to find a non-irritating hyaluronic acid delivery system. \n\nwater, **dimethicone**, glycerin, **dimeticone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer**, phenoxyethanol, polyacrylamide, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, dimethiconol, C13-14 isoparaffin, **dimethicone crosspolymer**, chlorphenesin, carbomer, laureth-7, sodium hyaluronate, ethylhexylglycerin, fragrance, C12-14 pareth-12, sodium hydroxide, blue 1 \n\nThe bolded ingredients indicate it's a silicone-based primer. Yes, the first ingredient is water, but the silicone is present in large amounts, and it interacts differently with water-based products.\n\nMistake 1: I was going for a low-effort look one day and decided to used some of my face powder and call it good. With face powder I usually wear my [NYX HD Primer](http://www.nyxcosmetics.com/high-definition-primer/NYX_180.html) because it's lighter but still holds the powder in place. That day my makeup was slipping and sliding everywhere and I looked like a cakey hot mess when I got home. I checked the ingredients on my moisturizer, found all the silicone, then looked at the primer ingredients. \n\n**Water/Aqua/Eau,** Propylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Diethylhexyl Maleate, Glycerin, Ethylene/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Dimethicone, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, PEG-15 Glyceryl Isostearate, Trihydroxystearin, Adipic Acid/Neopentyl Glycol Crosspolymer, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Tocopheryl Acetate, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax/Cera Carnauba/Cire de Carnauba, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7, Silica, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin,  Propylene Glycol Stearate, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Laurate, Propylene Glycol Laurate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Butylene Glycol, Salicornia Herbacea Extract, Copper Tripeptide-1,  Chlorphenesin, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, VP/VA Copolymer, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, C12-14 Pareth-7, Amodimethicone,  Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance/Parfum, Citronellol, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. MAY CONTAIN / PEUT CONTENIR (+/-): Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Zinc Oxide (CI 77947), Chromium Hydroxide Green (CI 77289), Ultramarines (CI 77007).\n\nThe water-based primer just sat on top of my moisturizer, making my makeup come off all over everything.\n\nMistake 2: I somehow spaced and forgot all about my moisturizer issues and yesterday I was rushing to leave and decided to just throw on some Sonia Kashuk Radiant Tinted Moisturizer and go. Wrong move. I had already washed my face and moisturized previously, so the Neutrogena moisturizers was under the tinted moisturizer. As I was rubbing the tinted moisturizer on my face, it started to ball up and look disgusting. I quickly wiped it off and left bare faced, but later I looked at the ingredients in the Sonia Kashuk Tinted Moisturizer. \n\nFluorphlogopite, Sorbitan Is Os Tearate,\nTris Iloxane, D Is Teardimonium Hectorite,\nCetyl Peg/Ppg‐10/1 D Imethicone,\nD Imethicone Cros S Polymer, Butylene Glycol,\nSilica D Imethyl Silylate, Synthetic Bees Wax,\nTetras Odium Ed Ta, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium\nChloride, Alcohol, Talc, Peg‐30\nD Ipolyhydroxys Tearate, Aluminum\nHydroxide, Potas S Ium Sorbate, Stearic Acid,\nCaprylyl Methicone, As Corbyl Palmitate,\nTocopherol, Pentaerythrityl Tetra‐Di‐T‐Butyl\nHydroxyhydrocinnamate.\nMay Contain: Mica, Titanium D Ioxide, Iron\nOxides , Zinc Oxide.\n\nThis one is a little more tricky, as it does have some dimethicone ingredients, but my best guess is that the other ingredients react negatively with the ingredients in the Neutrogena moisturizer.\n \nNow, I know this sounds like using the Neutrogena moisturizer is too much of a pain, but it's really not that big of a deal. My favorite primer, the [ELF Poreless Face Primer](http://www.elfcosmetics.com/p/poreless-face-primer?dept=face-faceprimer), works perfectly with this moisturizer and my HG foundation, [Revlon Colorstay Whipped](http://www.revlon.com/products/face/foundation-makeup/revlon-colorstay-whipped-creme-makeup#309971347054||0), goes on better than ever. I just wanted to make this post to inform people that mismatched moisturizer can cause just as many issues as mismatched primer and foundation!",

The next 28 terpenes are ordered alphabetically, and generally occur in smaller amounts.\n\n**1. Myrcene**  (Beta-Myrcene)  \nThe most common terpene in cannabis and hemp that can make up more than 2% of the weight of some [chemovars](https://www.royalqueenseeds.com/blog-cannabis-cultivars-vs-chemovars-vs-chemotypes-a-breakdown-n1374); also found in mangoes, thyme, citrus, and lemongrass, it has a musky, earthy, sweet herbal aroma. It is largely responsible for the green hop aroma in beer and is a major component in dry hopped beer.

Both alpha-pinene and beta-pinene have similar properties and aroma. It's got that pine forest aroma and is found in pine needles, dill, basil, parsley, conifers, and sage.  \nBoiling Point: alpha: [313ºF](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/6654#section=Boiling-Point) (156ºC), beta: [331ºF](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/14896#section=Boiling-Point) (166ºC)   \n*Reported Benefits:* alertness/focus enhancing, memory retention, anti-anxiety, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antitumor, antiviral, bronchodilator, gastrointestinal and neurological aid\n\n**5. Humulene** (Alpha-Humulene, Alpha-Caryophyllene)  \nContributes a woody, spicy-clove, \"watery\" aroma and is also found in allspice, hops, cloves and coriander. While it is common in cannabis and hemp flower, it is usually found in small amounts (<0.2%). Here's a [summary of recent research at ScienceDirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/humulene).  \nBoiling Point: 334ºF ([168ºC](http://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/data/rw1027221.html))  \n*Reported Benefits:* appetite suppressant, analgesic (pain reduction), anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anti-spasmodic, anti-tumor\n\n**6. Linalool**  \nA cannabis terpenoid also found in lavender, it has a floral, citrusy sweet aroma.

I'm pretty sure these are all  the same base sunscreen with the same protection. I would get the sunscreen with the simplest ingredient list and whichever one is cheapest. The About Me Be Clean seems to be alcohol and fragrance-free (non sure if rosemary leaf oil is an essential oil and fragrant??). I would probably go with the Innifree though because I prefer alcohol in my sunscreen, otherwise they are too too dewy and greasy looking, and the ingredient list is rather simple. If only it didn't have fragrance, but I can compromise with that. The Dr. G has too many unnecessary ingredients and many comedogenic ingredients like myristic acid, so I would stay away from it.",

    "body": "Wow 🤩 \n\nI picked up both of these strains today and they really are absolutely top shelf as expected.\n\nStarting with the packaging - they come in the same jars as Craft Botanics, and in nice boxes. There is lots of info about the strains and grow which is really wonderful - we really should have all the information about our medicines so it’s refreshing to have so much info come with strains. Each strain comes with a little info sheet together with music and food pairings for each strain, love this 🫶🏼\n\nThis is true craft cannabis, absolutely up there with the best MC I’ve had here. \n\nBoth jars have the most stunning visual and nose appeal, I could smell these for days 🥰\n\nThe Flurry - Ice Cream Cake x Miracle Alien Cookies - wow, what a strain combination sent straight from heaven. 28% THC and 2% CBD, Avant Brand grown in British Columbia. 1.54% terps.\n\nClassic Mac uplift and it has a really strong lime cordial taste. I have never had this combination of terps, it gets its own cannabis cup for me 🏆 \n\nThe terpinolene gives an uplift and the caryophylene is very subtle in smell which I appreciate. The mango comes through too, as well as a vanilla/cake vibe. This combination is out of this with, an absolute  10/10 for smell and taste. Perfectly cured and squishy 😍 Absolutely gorgeus trich small to mid size covered purple buds 💜\n\nThe effects - wow!!! super euphoric, very relaxing, it’s an indica dom but to me it has classic balanced hybrid vibes. Super cruisy but not sedating 🧘‍♀️ \n\nPebble Punch - Fruity Pebbles OG x Purple Punch 🤤 \nAnother absolute banger 🔥 \n26% THC and 1% CBD and  1.97% terps \n\nValhalla Flwr grown in British Columbia\nDivine taste of tropical fruit with a creamy/vanilla/fruity taste too. Squishy, well cured, absolutely delightful. Dense frosty green trich covered small to mid size buds 😋\n\nEffects are also super uplifting, with a bit more chill compared to the Flurry due to the linalool and myrcene terpenes.\n\nI think we all feel we have recently turned a big corner with more quality medical cannabis becoming available here 🥳 \n\nBetween Chemovar (absolutely cannot wait for the banging new strains to arrive) Superseed and Craft Botanics (I wish their new strains were released) and now Single Estate I think we have gone into new territory in terms of terpy fresh craft cannabis options.\n\nBeing a lover of fresh fruity and sweet candy terps I currently have my most fave rotation ever - Chemovar BFL, Superseed Rhapsody Haze, Single Estate Pebble Punch and The Flurry and Superseed Cake City 🍊🍋🍇🍑🍍🥭🍋‍🟩🍭🍬🍰🧁🍧🍡\n\nThese are both $165 RRP, for anyone looking for stock (before you ask lol) I picked mine up from the wonderful Gav at Heathershaws for $160.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Virgin hair, never been chemically treated, I don't do any heat styling, no blow-drying. Only Air-drying\n\n[Pic 1, Im turning away from camera](https://imgur.com/a/3YQDuew.jpg). Hair is so hard so photograph properly, If I get more accurate pictures, I'll edit to add.\n\nSo life's pretty bad right now, so I'm not able to do the elaborate hair care routine I used to. Nowadays, I don't even get time to oil my hair and if you've read any of my old posts, I'd have mentioned how I never ever wash my hair without oiling. But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This is an anti-dandruff shampoo and the best I've used so far.\n\nOther than the usual supermarket brands I've used Bioderma Node Ds (Excellent but pricey. Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles. Bottle looks super tiny and the plastic waste bothers me.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Re'equil Anti-Hairfall Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:   [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-c14-16-olefin-sulfonate), [Cocamidopropyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-hydroxysultaine), [Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-cocoyl-isethionate), [Decyl Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/decyl-glucoside), [Coco-Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/coco-glucoside), [Dexpanthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Glyceryl Oleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-oleate), [Biotin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/biotin), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Nasturtium Officinale Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/nasturtium-officinale-extract), [Tropaeolum Majus Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tropaeolum-majus-extract), [Polyquaternium-22](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-22), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Glycol Monostearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycol-stearate), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Methylchloroisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylchloroisothiazolinone), [Methylisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylisothiazolinone), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Ci 45100](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-45100), [Ci 42090](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-42090)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.450 for 250 ml. Max discount 30%.\n\nUsage Timeline: 2 months\n\nConsistency: It's a pink liquid. Normal shampoo consistency\n\nUsage:  I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: Oh my god, you guys. Best find of this year. This gives super shiny, sleek looking hair. I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember. I used up the entire bottle. I think 9ish months?? or more.\n\nConsistency: Normal shampoo consistency, HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above. Forever Repurchase. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Oriental Botanics Red Onion Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients: This has an ingredients list a mile long. Will update soon.\n\nPrice: MRP 449 for 300 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years and I'm only done with half the bottle\n\nConsistency: Normal Shampoo\n\nUsage: I take a lot and apply it from shoulders to ends, if I've not oiled my hair.\n\nReview: I literally had to go and check what the name of this product was to type this review and I've been using it for 2+ years. I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

I'm not sure why this works since leaving hair in water isn't good, but it does. Between just straight up applying it and doing this, this works better.

I get nice, shiny frizz free hair. The cost - benefit was insane and this was HG. Not going to say anything else, because it's not available and it's pointless.  I paid higher than MRP to get my hands on a tub, when I realised it was going to be rEfORmuLAted and I've had no regrets so far.

Straight up applying and mixing it with water, both works equally well. You might use up more if straight up applying it.\n\nReview: This is brilliant protein conditioner. If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

    "body": "**Useful** (with some qualifying statements, of course)\n\n[Glucosamine](http://examine.com/supplements/Glucosamine/) is finally not crap, but the chondroitin page is not done yet. (Also, shout out to Paul from [saveyourself.ca](http://saveyourself.ca/) as he helped me navigate some of this literature)\n\nGlucosamine is, honestly, really debatable; overall the evidence suggests that (for the purpose of **osteoarthritis only**):\n\n- When looking at statistical significance (chance the observations are due to the intervention and not pure chance) glucosamine is more effective than placebo and this appears to be reliable via multiple meta-analyses when you exclude the form of glucosamine hydrochloride (sulfate works, hydrochloride doesn't, fucked if I know why)\n- The clinical significance (magnitude of benefit of glucosamine over placebo in practical settings) is comparable to acetominophen, but in all honesty it isn't that amazing.\n- Although there does not appear to be a demonstratable publication bias with glucosamine, it is still suspected (there is a patented form of glucosamine sulfate salts and the patent holder likes to fund research). Despite not being shown in two meta-analyses that conducted publication bias assessment, if there *is* publication bias it could dwindle the already pretty small clinical significance\n- Since acetominophen is comparable in potency but doesn't have this publication bias concern, it is still the go-to drug for osteoarthritis\n\nWith other notables on glucosamine being:\n\n- It does not seem likely to be a substrate of collagen (too low a dose in serum) and the stimulation of collagen synthesis seems pretty overhyped as well (too low a concentration in serum). It likely just reduces the rate of collagen breakdown\n- Other compounds act via this mechanism as well, but glucosamine is by far the most well researched in interventions\n- There is *very limited* evidence for glucosamine supplementation in athletes and otherwise healthy people. Not enough to support its pain killing effects nor 'joint health' (pretty vague concept there) but some studies suggest that it could reduce the rate of collagen breakdown in atheltes, which are at higher risk for collagen degradation.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what to make of the whole 'athlete using glucosamine' issue. It won't hurt and glucosamine is very safe, and if you want to use it anyways you have my blessings. I'm going to try to look for better options anyways though (there appear to be a fair amount of things being looked into for [osteoarthritis](http://examine.com/topics/Symptoms+of+Osteoarthritis/), but seems research likes looking at this more than for athletes)\n\nThere was some fear mongering (I'm partially at fault here) for glucosamine in hindering glucose metabolism by causing insulin resistance, but this also doesn't seem to apply to humans due to the same reasons collagen synthesis and substrate issues don't; not enough reaches the blood and superloading still doesn't do much.\n\n> So in the end, glucosamine appears to be useful for persons suffering from osteoarthritis and with extra finances floating around who for some reason don't want to take the NSAID acetominophen (although taking both would be additive in benefits) and just don't expect glucosamine to 'cure' osteoarthritis; it reduces the rate of disease progression and that is all.\n\n**Questionably useful** (insufficient evidence, but interesting)\n\n[Aromatherapy](http://examine.com/supplements/Aromatherapy/)... yeah; I should clarify things before people try and take my head off.\n\nFirstly, on that meta-page the pages that are completed-ish at the moment are [Clary Sage](http://examine.com/supplements/Salvia+Sclarea/), [Rose](http://examine.com/supplements/Rose+Essential+Oil/), [Patchouli](http://examine.com/supplements/Patchouli/), and [Lemon balm](http://examine.com/supplements/Melissa+officinalis/). Please be aware of the evidence that is aroma based and the stuff that is oral based, as although lemon balm has a lot of evidence for its efficacy they are all oral studies (and there is no evidence to suggest the aroma of lemon does that stuff).\n\nI'm still working on [Fennel](http://examine.com/supplements/Fennel+Essential+Oil/) and [Lavender](http://examine.com/supplements/Lavender/) right now, but they are incomplete at the moment.\n\nOf those, the only interesting ones appear to be Rose/Lavender and Lemon Balm. Patchouli has some anti-viral properties that are promising but supplementation is not known to have the effects, and Clary sage is pretty confounded and the anti-cancer things are just theory at the moment.\n\nAll three 'interesting' herbs seem to have relaxing and anxiolytic properties, with rose being somewhat shown in humans following the aroma (and when hot boxing rats) and both lemon balm and lavender appear to do this following oral ingestion; some animal evidence that lavender does this with aromas, none for lemon balm.\n\nThere isn't sufficient evidence to really *recommend* any of these things aside from many lemon balm for the purpose of calming and relaxation without sedation (hard to assess potency here, there is no standard 'reference drug' for calmness aside from benzodiazepines which induce sedation). That being said, I wanted to get some pages on aromatherapy because it is interesting.\n\n(For those wondering how the hell this stuff can work, the 'essential oils' of plants contain both oils and volatile components; the volatile components can be lost into the air and they can make their way to the nose where they can either act on receptors directly to induce the perception of scent or they *might* be absorbed. However, I cannot find any studies looking at serum levels of these molecules following the smelling of them. However, the bioactivity of them is indeed linked back to certain molecules. Lemon balm is high in rosmarinic acid, Lavender in linalool and linalyl acetate, patchouli in patchouli alcohol and b-guainene, and rose in rose oxide and citronellol)\n\nAnd the aromatic molecules just look cool; I started research on these since patchouli alcohol reminded me of memantine due to its three dimensional and small structure (could not follow up on this though).\n\n(also, we did [watercress](http://examine.com/supplements/Watercress/) but I'm not sure how this fits anywhere; its a peppery broccoli that you can just eat rather than supplement?)\n\n**Notables**\n\nExamine is almost at 15,000 citations and 200,000 visitors per month. As we keep growing, we've announced an [Advisory Board](http://examine.com/about/) (accessible via the main page and the 'about' tab beside the top-right search bar). They are a bunch of smart people, in a variety of fields, that we can bounce ideas off of as we continue to evolve. Things are already under way, and pretty excited to see what unfolds in 2013.",

    "body": "Happy New Year! \nThis looks like a collab with Woody Nelson Country Club 🧊🔥 For those asking, the new jars are bigger than the old but much better imo, don't have to screw around with the lid so much.\n\n_STRAIN: Ice Burn - Grower: Koots Canna | Indica Dominant Hybrid _LINEAGE: Lava Cake x The Menthol x Temptation _BATCH: B347 _THC: 27% _TERPENES: Limonene, Linalool, Farnesene _APPLICATION: Joint, RAW Hemp, cardboard filter\n\n_BAG APPEAL: 9.5/10 - Dark, frosted bud with purple hues. Frosty medium to dense long bud structure. Covered in crystal trichomes and orange calyxes. fairly big nugs and some mediums. About the same stickiness as Romulan, very well cured and good moisture content again. Quite sticky as you break up the bud and has some give when you squeeze.\n\n_AROMA: 10/10 : Initial opening you get a very strong nose of peppermint menthol🌿, with sweet undertones of baked goods 🍰🧁 and some slight gas ⛽. Perhaps some pine needles 🌲 but very fresh. This is a very strong scent but very complex and satisfying one.️\n\n_TASTE: 10/10 - Completely smooth, with slight subtle minty-ness. Initially was very concerned that it might be overpowering with menthol but to my surprise it was a really nice smooth sweet flavour.\nInhaling was almost a cooling sensation from the menthol and it rounds off with a really sweet creamy almost vanilla texture.\n\n_EXPERIENCE: 9.5/10 - Again with all great cannabis, it has a smooth burn with white ash and heavy oil streaks on the paper. Unlike Romulan, this wasn't a creeping effect but more a delayed onset. You kind of don't feel anything for a few minutes then it ramps up very quickly.\nTingling body feeling with some euphoric mental state.  It is a full head experience initially but moves very quickly to the body. Very relaxed and chilled state. I would describe it as more 'dreamy' and floaty.\nI slept like a log with this, wow. i actually passed out on the couch which never happens but might've been tired and this at the same time.\n\n_OVERALL: 9.8/10 - Where do i start? This is from the Kootenay region in Canada, known for some of the best cannabis in the world. Thoroughly enjoyed this strain. Top tier quality. It slots straight into probably my top 3 at the moment. It has a really subtle flavour of menthol without being super over powering, with the added creaminess it gives it a lot of body and texture.\nI had appendicitis this week and ended up in hospital and it was exactly what i needed.\n\n_Would I buy again?: 1000% YES _Would i keep in rotation?: YES\nRRP $165",

Just because it takes the # of reviews into account. You can find lots of good reviews vouching for very good products with lesser amount of reviews. It doesn't necessarily mean that just because a product is extremely popular, there can't be lesser known amazing products as well. For some categories, like toners and creams, I feel that it's worth to look all the way down towards the 40s and 50s. I think I will make certain categories longer if you guys don't mind my spamming, lol.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm thinking doing creams or gels next. =) Thank you everybody for the comments, glad to see the time I spent making these posts is helping some of you!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Oils & Gels](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6dqq7/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing_oils_gels/)\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Balms/Milks/Creams & Foams](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6fso3/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing/)",

    "body": "The **51st Amendment of the International Fragrance Association (IFRA)** introduced stricter regulations on various fragrance components to ensure safety and sustainability. While these changes aim to protect consumers, they pose significant challenges for perfumers, especially when reformulating iconic classics and beloved contemporary creations.\n***\n**Compliance Deadlines**\n\n**New Formulas:**\n\n* Prohibited ingredients: *August 30, 2023*\n* Full compliance: *March 30, 2024*\n\n**Existing Formulas:**\n\n* Prohibited ingredients: *July 30, 2024*\n* Full compliance: *October 30, 2025*\n***\n\n**Key Ingredient Changes and Impacts on Perfumes**\n\n**1. Hydroperoxides from Linalool and Limonene**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Linalool\n* Limonene\n\n**What Changed:**  \nStricter limits have been imposed on the hydroperoxides formed when Linalool and Limonene oxidize. These allergens are prevalent in floral and citrus accords.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Guerlain Shalimar* \\- The bergamot-heavy opening will feel less sparkling and effervescent, softening its characteristic freshness.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Dior Sauvage EDT* \\- The bright citrus freshness in the top notes may lose its zesty impact, muting the fragrance's immediate vibrancy.\n***\n\n**2. Synthetic Musks**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Musk Xylene\n* Musk Ketone\n* Musk Ambrette\n\n**Alternatives:** Ambrettolide, Cashmeran\n\n**What Changed:**  \nRestrictions on synthetic musks promote the use of safer alternatives.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Chanel No. 5* \\- The iconic musky dry-down may lose its sensual depth, becoming cleaner and woodier.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Narciso Rodriguez for Her* \\- The plush, velvety musk might feel less enveloping, replaced by a more modern and airy quality.\n***\n\n**3. Oakmoss and Tree Moss**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Oakmoss (Evernia Prunastri)\n* Tree Moss (Evernia Furfuracea)\n* Atranol, Chloroatranol\n\n**What Changed:**  \nTighter restrictions on moss-derived allergens have led to increased reliance on synthetic substitutes.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Guerlain Mitsouko* \\- The deep, mossy chypre base will lose some of its earthy richness.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Tom Ford Beau de Jour* \\- The green, mossy accords will feel less vibrant, with synthetic alternatives offering a cleaner profile.\n***\n\n**4. Iso-E Super**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Iso-E Super\n\n**What Changed:**  \nNew thresholds limit the use of this cornerstone of woody and amber notes.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Terre d’Hermes* \\- The woody-mineral dry-down will feel less pronounced, softening the fragrance's overall impact.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Escentric Molecules Molecule 01* \\- Reduced levels will make the scent less warm and smooth, affecting its minimalist charm.\n***\n\n**5. Aldehydes**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* C10 Aldehyde (Decanal)\n* C12 Aldehyde (Dodecanal)\n* C16 Aldehyde (Hexadecanal)\n* C18 Aldehyde (Octadecanal)\n\n**What Changed:**  \nStricter allergen limits have been introduced for aldehydes, which lend crispness and sparkle to fragrances.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Chanel No. 5* \\- The iconic soapy and powdery opening will feel softer and less effervescent.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Lancome La Vie Est Belle* \\- The fresh, clean aldehydic top notes will be dialled back, making the fragrance warmer and heavier.\n***\n\n**6. Phthalates**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Diethyl Phthalate (DEP)\n* Dibutyl Phthalate (DBP)\n* Dioctyl Phthalate (DOP)\n\n**What Changed:**  \nPhthalates, used as fixatives, face stricter regulations due to potential endocrine-disrupting effects.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Dior Poison* \\- Reduced fixatives may result in diminished lasting power and projection.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Viktor & Rolf Flowerbomb* \\- Sweetness and warmth may become less intense, making the fragrance feel lighter.\n***\n\n**7. Coumarin**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Coumarin (Tonka bean extract)\n\n**What Changed:**  \nCoumarin restrictions aim to reduce allergenic risks.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Guerlain Jicky* \\- The powdery, sweet tonka note will be less pronounced, resulting in a more herbal composition.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Armani Si* \\- The powdery sweetness will soften, making the fragrance feel drier.\n***\n\n**8. Cinnamaldehyde**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Cinnamaldehyde (Cinnamon extract)\n\n**What Changed:**  \nCinnamon’s spicy warmth is now more restricted due to its allergenic potential.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Estee Lauder Youth Dew* \\- The fragrance’s spicy intensity will soften.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Jo Malone Cinnamon and Tonka* \\- Cinnamon will feel less spicy, leaning towards a smoother profile.\n***\n\n**9. Geraniol and Citronellol**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Geraniol\n* Citronellol\n\n**What Changed:**  \nTighter thresholds aim to reduce allergenic reactions in floral fragrances.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Yves Saint Laurent Paris* \\- The rose note will become less vibrant.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Chloe Eau de Parfum* \\- The fresh floral opening may feel subtler.\n***\n\n**10. Benzyl Alcohol and Benzyl Salicylate**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Benzyl Alcohol\n* Benzyl Salicylate\n\n**What Changed:**  \nBoth are restricted to reduce allergenic risks.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Guerlain Shalimar* \\- The powdery floral aspect will feel lighter.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue* \\- The floral accords will diminish slightly.\n***\n\n**Commercial and Consumer Implications**\n\n**For Perfume Enthusiasts:**\n\n* Iconic fragrances may feel less familiar as reformulations result in lighter, less impactful experiences.\n* Vintage batches of popular fragrances may gain value due to perceptible differences.\n\n**For the Industry:**\n\n* Niche brands face greater challenges due to cost pressures and limited resources for R&D on synthetic alternatives.\n* Innovation in synthetic molecules will accelerate as brands strive to balance compliance with olfactory quality.\n\n**Winners:** Clean, minimalist fragrances that align with these regulatory changes.\n\n**Losers:** Classic, mossy chypres and musky orientals reliant on restricted ingredients.\n***\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe IFRA 51st Amendment continues to raise the bar for safety and sustainability in perfumery. However, its restrictions challenge brands to balance regulatory compliance with preserving olfactory artistry. As the fragrance landscape evolves, the industry is likely to witness a renaissance of synthetic innovation, while consumers adjust to a lighter, cleaner fragrance experience.\n***\n\n*I’ve tried to break this down to the best of my abilities and understanding. Apologies if I’ve overlooked or missed anything. The example of perfumes changing is just a hypothesis, if companies manage to find like-for-like alternatives, you wouldn’t notice the difference. However, that has never been the case in the past.*\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE** - The intent here is simply to inform you, please, I repeat, **DO NOT** take this as some alarmist message designed to pressure you into buying something you don’t need. Perfumes are not a necessity. If you don’t get that vintage 1940s batch of Guerlain Vetiver, life will go on, and nothing will change.\n",

From a perfume experience perspective, manufacturers may comply with limitations by reducing levels of certain ingredients or substituting them with alternatives to meet regulatory requirements. This might affect the perfume experience positively, negatively, or not at all. However, manufacturers will likely prioritize maintaining the user experience, even with necessary reformulations.\n\n3. What should consumers do—use newly reformulated perfumes or stick to older ones? In my view, safety should always take precedence over the perfume experience.",

    "body": "This is going to be a long one, so I'll put the TL;DR at the start: Consistently taking probiotics (as suggested by a pharmacist in Turkey while I was on holiday visiting family back home) basically \"cured\" my eczema.\n\n_Background information: I've had eczema since I was a child but after I hit my teens I basically just had to deal with mild eczema on the insides of my elbows in the winter, and generally I \"just\" had really dry skin (especially eyelids). In fall of 2023 I developed an allergy to linalool which caused constant flare ups on my neck, throat, elbows and especially eyelids (They looked like I had burn marks at one point — I could've cosplayed Prince Zuko from Avatar). Just after I finally figured that out, a really stressful time of my life started: the dreaded German teacher trainee program. It lasted 21 months and I could not go a week without a flare up in that time — still in the same spots._\n\nTo celebrate having passed the German equivalent of the bar exam for teachers I went to Turkey to visit family with my mom last winter. My family constantly cranked up the heating though, which lead to a horrible flare up that left me begging a pharmacist to please sell me some hydrocortisone (I know, I know) because I just couldn't handle it anymore. She did!\n\nBut the pharmacist also asked why I wasn't taking any probiotics if I had eczema. I was completely clueless and she gave me a pack on the house and said I'd thank her later — and she was right. Initially I didn't believe it would make a difference at all, and especially since I had gotten hydrocortisone I didn't notice it helping at first.\n\nOnce they ran out I initially didn't repurchase any because I thought now that the stress is over and I'm avoiding my allergies my skin would go back to what it was like before, but then my skin randomly started flaring up again. On a whim I ordered some probiotics (Link: https://amzn.eu/d/2IQ95hP, I made sure it had Lactobacillus in it) and noticed that whenever I stopped taking them for a while (I forgot about them for ~1 1/2 weeks) my skin would flare up again. \n\nFor almost 2 1/2 years I could not go a week without having a flare up. It has now pretty much come to an end thanks to taking these probiotics and avoiding my allergies. All I'm left with these days are some patches of dry skin on my lower eyelid (which is annoying when wearing make up, but otherwise harmless) — so if anyone is struggling and hasn't given probiotics a shot yet, maybe it'll help you too!",

Unfortunately, it carries with it a long history of being a persecuted plant.\" Dr. Donald Abrams Chief of Hematology Oncology at San Francisco General Hospital ||\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||||\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nApproximately 106,000 Americans die yearly from prescribed medications, according to the American Medical Association.\n\nEven more frightening, preventable medical errors account for a staggering 400,000 deaths in the U.S. each year - and is considered the 3rd leading cause of death.\n\n>\"It's equivalent to 2,000 commercial jets taking off each year knowing that they don't have enough fuel to complete their journeys,\" notes Peter Edelstein M.D.  \n   \n\"Would you allow your spouse to board one of those planes? Your friend? A stranger?\"\n\nGood question.\n\nIncreasingly, people in the West are seeking out treatments that work harmoniously with the body, instead of against it - in other words, they're walking away from the medical establishment and all its mishaps, mistakes and pharmaceutical drugs.\n\nA case in point is cannabis, especially in its raw form.  \n \n\n**A Rich History**  \nMarijuana is one of those plants that, to many, conjures visions of *Drug Enforcement Administration* (DEA) raids and hippies in a drugged-out daze.\n\nBut it wasn't always this way.\n\n>\"The ancient Chinese knew of marijuana's pain-relieving and mind-altering effects, yet it was not widely employed for its psychoactive properties; instead it was [cultivated as hemp](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_industryhealthiermedica.htm#Hemp_-_C%C3%A1%C3%B1amo) for the manufacture of rope and fabric.  \n   \nLikewise, the ancient Greeks and Romans used hemp to make rope and sails. In some other places, however, marijuana's intoxicating properties became important. In India, for example, the plant was incorporated into religious rituals.  \n   \nDuring the Middle Ages, its use was common in Arab lands; in 15**th**\\-century Iraq it was used to treat epilepsy; in Egypt it was primarily consumed as an inebriant.  \n   \nAfter Napoleon's occupation of Egypt, Europeans began using the drug as an intoxicant. During the slave trade, it was transported from Africa to Mexico, the Caribbean and South America. Marijuana gained a following in the U.S. only relatively recently.  \n   \nDuring the second half of the 19**th** century and the beginning of the 20**th**, cannabis was freely available without a prescription for a wide range of ailments, including migraine and ulcers,\" Roger A. Nicoll and Bradley N. Alger remind us in Scientific American.\n\nEven American Founding Father **Thomas Jefferson** declared:\n\n>\"Hemp is of first necessity to the wealth and protection of the country.\"\n\nSo what happened?  \n\n\nIn 1937, the United States Congress decided - against the recommendation of the American Medical Association - to pass the [Marijuana Tax Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marihuana_Tax_Act_of_1937). The legislation essentially banned the use of marijuana by making it excessively expensive and difficult to secure.\n\nIt has been downhill ever since. That is, until the last few years where legalization of marijuana has exploded in the U.S., for both recreational and medicinal uses.\n\nFor our purposes here, we're going to look at the health benefits of the plant - which are quite impressive.  \n \n\n**An Essential Vegetable**\n\n>\"It \\[cannabis\\] has captured these molecules that help our bodies regulatory system be more effective.  \n   \nThe bottom line is it's a dietary essential that helps all 210 cell types function more effectively. I don't even refer to it as medicine anymore, strictly as a dietary essential.\"  \n**Dr. William L. Courtney**\n\nIt may be a stretch for some to recognize raw cannabis as the next in-demand superfood, but Dr. **William L.** **Courtney**, a physician with extensive medical training who specializes in the dietary uses of cannabis, presents a provocative case.  \n\n\nWhen you heat or age cannabis, Dr. Courtney believes that *you lose* *99%* *of the benefit cannabis provides.*\n\nIn contrast, if you consume it raw, you'll reap the full value of the plant. Plus, raw cannabis is non-psychoactive, so you won't experience a high - an important point for those who would like to utilize the healing aspects of cannabis without feeling drugged or off-center.\n\nThis means you can also consume a much higher amount of health-promoting compounds with raw cannabis juice compared to if it was smoked or extracted as an oil, according to Dr. Courtney.\n\n>[Terpenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terpene), essential oils found in cannabis which give the plant its unique aroma, are particularly compelling.  \n   \nA study ([Taming THC - Potential Cannabis Synergy and Phytocannabinoidterpenoid Entourage Effects](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/archivos_pdf/taming-thc.pdf)) published in the *British Journal of Pharmacology* states that terpenoids are,\"pharmacologically versatile: they are lipophilic, interact with cell membranes, neuronal and muscle ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, G-protein coupled (odorant) receptors, second messenger systems and enzymes.\"  \nThe researchers explored the powerful effect terpenes exert in animal tests.  \n[Limonene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limonene) was found to increase serotonin in the prefrontal cortex and dopamine in the hippocampus region of the brain - both of which help fend-off depression and feelings of stress.  \n   \nMoreover, limonene induces apoptosis (cell death) of breast cancer cells and demonstrated exceptional radical scavenging properties. It's also remarkably bio-available, rapidly metabolized and is highly non-toxic and non-sensitizing.  \n   \n[Myrcene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrcene) is anti-inflammatory and an effective sleep aid, while pinene acts as a bronchodilator and broad spectrum antibiotic - including the destruction of lethal MRSA bacteria.  \n   \n[Pinene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinene) also curbs inflammation. Linalool is a sedative and anticonvulsant.  \n   \n[Caryophyllene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caryophyllene) is antimalarial, anti-inflammatory and useful in treating duodenal ulcers.  \n   \n[Nerolidol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerolidol) inhibits fungal growth and protozoal parasites.  \n   \n[Phytol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytol) increases GABA expression, resulting in a calming effect.\n\nThese are just a handful of the 200 varieties of terpenes found in cannabis.\n\n**How to Enjoy More Raw Cannabis in Your Life**  \nFor a daily dose, Dr. Courtney advises juicing fifteen cannabis leaves and two buds, which is then added to a small amount of fruit or vegetable juice that is consumed throughout the day.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about juicing cannabis, [this article](http://www.medicaljane.com/2013/01/19/cannabis-the-foundation-of-health/) offers tips and suggestions. Keep in mind that juicing improperly may create heat, which will cause THC to form.\n\n**Jeffrey C. Raber**, Ph.D. also recommends having the strain of marijuana you're using tested at a reliable and accurate lab so you know exactly what you are getting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Leaf\n\n[VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa0nLdVJiIg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n**Sources**\n\n>[https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/patient-power/201409/do-you-know-the-3rd-leading-cause-death-you-should](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/patient-power/201409/do-you-know-the-3rd-leading-cause-death-you-should)  \n[http://www.humboldtjustice.com/images/BrainsOwnMJ-SA04-NoPix.pdf](http://www.humboldtjustice.com/images/BrainsOwnMJ-SA04-NoPix.pdf)  \n[http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/juicing-raw-cannabis-eating-raw-cannabis/](http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/juicing-raw-cannabis-eating-raw-cannabis/)  \n[http://www.cannabisinternational.org/info/Non-Psychoactive-Cannabinoids.pdf](http://www.cannabisinternational.org/info/Non-Psychoactive-Cannabinoids.pdf)  \n[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3165946/](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3165946/)  \n[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robbie-gennet/on-role-models-and-their\\_b\\_164387.html](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robbie-gennet/on-role-models-and-their_b_164387.html)  \n[http://www.projectcbd.org/medicine/terpenses/](http://www.projectcbd.org/medicine/terpenses/)  \n[http://thewercshop.com](http://thewercshop.com/)",

    "body": "I am a hairdresser and have been doing Brazilian hair blow-drying in a salon for years. Evaporation of the product during blow-drying burns my eyes, my throat burns, sometimes I feel a burning sensation in my chest, I get headaches and sometimes migraines (I have had migraines for many years, but I noticed that I get them more often when I do more Brazilian treatments) , even some customers shed tears and have to keep their eyes closed while blow-drying. \n\n   \nI’ve never thought too much about the toxicity of the product, so I googled a bit and found a few articles that write about the dangers of the contents of Brazilian treatment products, so I decided to share with you some of the substances found in CHOCOCOCO  and their side effects: \n\n* **Stearic Acid** \\- Inhalation may cause chemical pneumonitis  \n* **Behentrimonium chloride**  is considered toxic in concentrations of 0.1% and above and is suspected to cause skin and eye irritation. \n* **Phenoxyethanol** is actually very harmful if swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through the skin, especially for breastfeeding or infants, It can also have an effect on the brain and central nervous system. If you are exposed to the product several times a day, every day, it can accumulate and probably have a bad effect on you. The American Cancer Society warns that formaldehyde is a known carcinogen. This means it can cause cancer or help cancer grow. Formaldehyde can also trigger other side effects. May be toxic in concentrations of 1% or less. Tests show that keratin treatments contain unsafe levels of formaldehyde and other chemicals. The FDA has received dozens of product complaints. One hairdresser, for example, said her treatments caused her migraines, blurred vision, sore throat, nausea and loss of smell. \n* **Glycolic acid**  shows some inhalation toxicity and can cause damage to the respiratory system, thymus and liver if they are present at very high levels over a long period of time. \n* **Coumarin**  is moderately toxic to the liver and kidneys. \n* **Benzyl benzoate** side effects: irritations of the skin, eyes, nose and throat that can cause severe symptoms such as burning, nausea, vomiting and damage to the liver and kidneys. \n\n Some manufacturers claim that their keratin treatment does not contain **formaldehyde**, although there are studies that state the opposite. \n\nI would just like to briefly explain the process of Brazilian blow-drying for those who do not know: \n\n1. Hair is washed with a special shampoo (from the manufacturer, of course) \n2. The product is applied to dry hair, after 20 min it is blow-dried  \n3. Blow-drying causes a strong and visible evaporation of the product, the steam of which goes straight into my face (after blow-drying, the whole salon stinks of it, and is in the fog)  \n4. Hair is ironed at 220'C (which causes evaporation, but not in such quantities)  \n5. After the treatment, the hair is washed with special shampoos (Again, from the manufacturer, of course) \n\nI just want to state that I am not a chemist nor am I knowledgeable in chemistry in any way so I hope if someone is educated in this field I would be grateful if you would leave an opinion, also I do not know the percentage of these substances because their website does not state it.  \n\nHere is a list of all the ingredients in their product: \n\n Aqua, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Keratin / Hydrolysed Keratin, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Beta Vulgaris (Beet) Root Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Bark / Leaf / Twig Extract, Calendula Officinalis (Marigold) Flower Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Extract, Behentrimonium Chloride, Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii, Shea Butothera Evening Primrose) Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Chondrus Crispus (Carrageenan) Extract, Maris Sal (Dead Sea Salt), Dehydroacetic Acid, Aloe (Vera) Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Squalane, Ascorbic Acid Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Fragrance, Retinyl Palmitate, Phenoxyethanol, Glycolic Acid, Coumarin, Linalool, Limonene, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate  \n\nThanks for reading and I will be grateful for any information and opinions <3",

        "body": "Hmm looking at that ingredients list I have to say it looks very innocent imo! I would have expected to see some hard core stuff in such product. Looking at Kerastase and Redken ingredients lists are generally way more frightening. I can’t see any really nasty things in the list- the nastiest ones are Coumarin, Linalool, Limonene, Alpha- isomethyl ionone and benzoyl salicylate. These are fragrances that are more allergenic than when the list just says fragrance or perfume ( the manufacturer has to write the most allergenic fragrances separately in the list). But again- all of these will be found in almost any salon hair products with fragrance- and in a lot of “ natural” products as well. Phenoxyethanol is in basically every product you buy for hair, body or face. It acts as a stabilizer or as a preservative in products and became highly popular when parabens got unpopular. It is generally considered safe in small concentrations ( under 1%) for adults. It’s not considered safe for children under age 3 and should not be used if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding. It has nothing to do with Formaldehyde as far as I know. Again- phenoxyethanol is in almost any product, even in the most sensitive no perfume no color brands. If you have to avoid it I think you would be limited to raw oils and the baby products.\nOverall I think that the list looks very descent. With some quite good stuff in it as well.\nAlso FYI I’m not educated in this, so I’m by no means an expert- it’s just a weird hobby😅\n\nEdit: I would also recommend wearing a mask and glasses when using. It looks safe when applying normally to hair but it’s not meant to be inhaled/ go in the eyes of course.",

I really don't think it's \"toxic\" in the context of hair products, otherwise it wouldn't be so widely used in conditioner formulations. \n\nThe only significant source of irritation from behentrimonium chloride could be if it gets in your eyes. By that metric, almost all ingredients in shampoos and conditioners are toxic, since they would probably hella sting if they got in your eyes, lol. It probably contributed to the stinging of your eyes, but its inclusion in wash-out products is not a problem otherwise imo",

I make candles and am fine with pretty much all fragrance oils, but I know candle maker friends who can't work with certain oils because of their individual sensitivities. \n\nAlso, if I was interested in getting a Brazilian blowout, I'd be super appreciative if the stylist sent me the list of ingredients beforehand so I could check sensitivities, esp because it sounds like some of your clients have had similar reactions.",

Just like with x-rays, the patient has little to no danger from the short and infrequent exposure but the tech needs protection since 40 hrs a week with frequent exposures IS dangerous.\n\nThe first salon I worked at stopped doing these treatments specifically because of the physical effects we were experiencing.

        "body": "While you’re not wrong that the traditional Brazilian blowout is very toxic and releases formaldehyde when heat is applied to the hair the initial time at the salon, I am not reading anything specifically in those ingredients you listed that would cause this process. Glycolic acid would be suspected if it were high on the list, because glyxolic acid and ingredients with similar names may consist of one of the first ingredients in a “new and improved” Brazilian blowout (which still releases formaldehyde, they tend to just be sneakier about their product claims). The ingredient list you posted doesn’t have those ingredients, from what I can tell (but hey, I’m not a chemist, so if anyone is an expert in that field, please chime in). \n\nBehentrimonium chloride is an extremely popular ingredient in many hair conditioners, both drugstore branded and professional. I haven’t heard any recent research regarding controversy with the ingredient, but it very well could only be toxic under certain circumstances of which I can’t attest to (such as applying heat and keratin with it). \n\nThe first ingredient is water, the next is a harmless emulsifier (which allows the cream to keep it from separating), the third ingredient is an animal protein that comes from animal hair/hooves/horns. It’s not a scary ingredient, it’s just a cheap protein compared to keratin. Then keratin, followed by a lot of essential oils (which I wouldn’t be surprised if they were the culprit here). Fragrances, especially ones as volatile as essential oils, *especially* when you mix a buttload of them, generally do not play well with being heated against the hair at 450F. The rest of the ingredients are comprised of ingredients that make up less than ~1%, like tiny fragrance ingredients (linalool, limonine), and preservatives to keep it from spoilage (benzyl salicylate). \n\nI would definitely discontinue that brand, especially because unless there are extra ingredients/steps in the treatment aside from that ingredient list, I’m not sure I understand how they are meant to last for 3-6 months on anyone. None of the ingredients to form any sort of lasting keratin bond to the hair appear to be in that ingredient list, and the ones that could potentially play any role are in such minutes qualities to almost be meaningless. The glycolic acid being near the end of the ingredient list suggests it’s much more likely that it was a minor pH adjustment to the formula, not any life-changing chemical reaction. It seems as if your salon is getting ripped off by whoever is promoting their line of keratin treatments to you. The Cezanne line is one of the better ingredient lists out there, but I’ve only been doing a deep dive (as a current stylist) on this treatment since right before I did one on myself. I did the long lasting Cezanne treatment and there is absolutely no smell at any point in the process. You just have to make sure when you rinse the product, you don’t rinse too much of it out before you pat-dry and blow dry or there won’t be enough keratin still on the hair to bond correctly.",

Very typical Gastro Pop euphoria, perfect for an evening wind down, setting myself up for a relaxed and blissful evening 🧘‍♀️ \n\nThe cure is bang on - squishy, beautiful moisture level, tacky, sticky, resinous, trich covered frosty goodness 😛\n\nIt produces lots of vapour and I didn’t need much to feel very well medicated 🌞\n\nI feel the Aussie MC landscape is changing with quality increasing and prices decreasing. I’m more than happy to pay whatever is needed to get fresh terpy buds but the price on the new Chemovar strains are a game changer for the OZ MC scene - high end craft cannabis at mid prices 🎉 I’m happy and so is my wallet!\n\nI’m keen to trial their Triangle Chem next which I think should be super effective for my insomnia 😴 \n\nAll the new Chemovar releases are such heavenly strain crosses, I love my fruit and candy and I already am in love with Bling Blaow and can’t wait for Facade (apples and bananas x eye candy)🍭 \n\nI would say this is one of the best and most enjoyable and terpiest strains available here, highly recommended!\n\nThank you Chemovar!!! 🙌🏽🎉🥰🔥🥳",

(ie Bazookas, HIGH THC low terps)  \nIn Australia, TGA allows 20% label variance for potency. IE you can label 30% and have technically 24% test result. As far as im aware no rules on Terpene claim %.

    "body": "Scentional Salutation to all my  soothsayers,  sage, saphic shera and celestial stars!\n\nWhy do I need to write this post? because y'all [clary sage](https://i.imgur.com/pIbJn3V.jpg) is growing on me as a note - technically it is taking over my garden, and i'm entering my sage era of embracing the chaotic beauty. \n\nWe need to talk - I told the clary sage the other day. And that biatch told me he is just a fragment of my imagination, and I should probably stop  looking for love and affection in the wrong places. \n\n- **Scientific name**: *Salvia sclarea*\n\n- **Main aromatic compounds**:  Linalool (17.2%) is the most common aromatic compound from sage flower and leaf oil, followed by terpineol (15.1%), linalyl acetate (14.3%), geraniol (6.5%), nerol (5.5%), neryl acetate (5.2%), and sclareol (5.2%) [1] Interestingly, Sclarene ( a sclareol derivative) also finds an uptick used in modern perfumary.\n\n- **Scent descriptions**: Musky floral with a balmy  herbaceous green tone. It also works as  a very effective fixer ( and not the upper kind moma warned me about) in my homegrown tincture and salve.\n\nThese are the top 5 fragrances that I have found to have a particularly clever usage of clary sage and its derivatives:\n\n\n- **Hermes H24**: Suit and tie, elegant in a very kept and minimalist style - he comes from old money and has always known wealth. Sometimes he is too polite, but you can tell he can be fun.  This contemporary rendition of modern masculinity is here to stay. Clary Sage (or particularly sclarene) lends a pristine, freshly pressed shirt feel to this otherwise hypoallergenic and slightly anemic fragrance. This one earns a personal rating of 4.12/5 \n\n- **Dior Sausaage edt**: You could do wurst with your fragrance choices. Unfortunately, too many dicks have ruined this clean, fresh and aromatic creation. And no, i'm not that hungry to go for a <pen is> joke. The clary sage adds a clean, fresh and out of the shower feel to this fragrance- thought its presence is much less noticeable if you don't look for it. Not listed as official notes, and we definitely should discuss this over a cute meet if you want to. Personally, I don't think of this fragrance.\n\n- **DS. & Durga Cowboy Grass**:  the modern cowboy heralding the cashing cows of the entertainment industries: influencers, Tiktoker, vtubers. But the love story is just too charming: landvender sky, long walk under the Brooklyn bridge, clove cigarette. But thyme is the cruelist of all, turning lover to stranger.  The clary sage addsa herbaceous, almost bitter green to this   otherwise bracing fragrance. A personal rating of  3.89/5\n\n\n- **Tauer LoneStar Memories**: Save a horse, ride a cowboy - hot, sweaty and animalic amber that brings back memories of passionate nights. This is a sexy beast that keeping on giving.  The clary sage adds reason to talk about this fantastic fragrance , 'cause it works more as a fixer than an aromatic compound. 4.01/5 - thank you for the memories \n\n- **Dusita Erawan**: This is the last day of summer: long walk, starlit sky, the soothing sound of waves crashing by pier. The almost lover to Cowboy grass - a love story that makes you feel like a teenager again. There's no thyme, just hay! gurl'  you look gorgeous. The clary sage adds a floral and balmy undertone.  Truly one of the more accomplished fragrances out there. A solid 3.98/5 for me.\n\n\nThank you for perusing my post. I'm looking forward to reading what are your favourite fragrances featuring this note. Also, is it just me or there are not many female-marketed fragrances that include this fantastic material? \n\nI hope you fine folks have a lovely rest of the week, and to my beloved coven - we wear Beaufort CdN on Wednesday.\n\n\n With love and solidarity,\n\nu/fanofam \n\n\n\n\nReferences: \n\n(1) Hans, M., Deeksha, N., Nayik, G.

I agree that it's underused in female-marketed fragrances. The Internet tells me it does pop up in Elizabeth Arden White Tea, another favourite, but to my nose it's fairly faint there. Either way, I definitely support more clary sage in feminine perfumery; we've done it with lavender, now it's time to move on to the other aromatics!",

Me and my girlfriend both think the opening smells like baby wipes in the opening but not in a super bad way and then intensely floral that powders down a tiny bit in the base. I obviously didn't come up with this entirely on my own as things I can kind of make up entirely from my own nose are quite basic and I'm finding balance is quite difficult by smell only but I am learning the smells of everything I have slowly.\n\nRaspberry Ketone: 100mg\nEthyl Butyrate: 300 mg\nHedione: 300 mg\nMelonal: 50 mg\n\nFraterworks Honeysuckle Base: 500 mg\nYlang Ylang: 73 mg\nJasmine Absolute: 70 mg\nLinalool: 300 mg\nCoranol: 300 mg\n\nEthyl Vanillin: 40mg\nHeliotropin: 60 mg\nCoumarin: 75mg\nEthyl Maltol: 10mg \nIso E Super: 100 mg\nAmbroxan: 60 mg\nGalaxolide: 50 mg\n\nDiluted to 10ml total",

Here you go:\n\nHoneysuckle FW - 20.94%   \nEthyl Butyrate - 12.56%   \nHedione - 12.56%   \nLinalool - 12.56%   \nCoranol - 12.56%   \nRaspberry Ketone - 4.19%   \nIES - 4.19%   \nCoumarin - 3.14%   \nYlang EO - 3.06%   \nJasmine absolute - 2.93%   \nHeliotropin - 2.51%   \nAmbroxan - 2.51%   \nMelonal - 2.09%   \nGalaxolide - 2.09%   \nEthyl vanillin - 1.68%   \nEthyl maltol - 0.42%\n\nThat seems like a lot of ethyl butyrate; butyrates in general tend to live more around the 0.5% mark.  Does it not create a piercing or off-note in the final product?\n\nI don't have the Honeysuckle FW but Jamie has a demo formula which includes it at 2%.  At 20% is it not just annihilating the rest of the composition?\n\nThe \"baby wipes\" is the ylang and jasmine.  Jasmine absolute smells like clean diapers to me (in a good way!) and the ylang will push that to the opening too.\n\nRaspberry ketone is typically dosed at 1/10th of what you have here or less; that could be something to try.\n\nLong story short:  I think you need to iterate on the ratios here a lot.

An array of purples (next to no green), orange pistils and a blanket of trichomes. Cracking the tub, there was a subtle hint of berries combined with sweet vanilla, as well as an earthy/spicey, cakey aroma. Small to medium sized buds that are ever so slightly dry with a humidity pack included. Very smooth inhaling through the venty gradually increasing from 160 degrees up to 210. More floral, fruity flavours come through at lower temps and a bit more of a spicy/earthy flavour kicks in towards 200. Effects initially were calming and peaceful yet somewhat cerebral. I felt a euphoric head high mixed with a light full body relaxation. Nothing that'll hit you for six, but a pleasant afternoon or early evening indica-dominant flower that'll help destress the mind and body at the end of a day. Assisted in decreasing my anxiety and pain management. The higher the temp I vaped it at, the heavier my body felt and less motivated I became to get on the move. Overall, a quality product at a reasonable price with a great trim and cure. Fantastic product from Aura Therapeutics. Key Lime Pie is next on the list! Happy medicating 👌",

But seriously, the chemistry of tequila and the blue agave plant is fascinating and I thought I'd draw out a few different versions of a margarita glass. One is just that, a margarita glass filled to the salted rim with some of the molecules found in the plant and in tequila. The second shows the blue agave plant with the margarita glass as the plant's bloom. I drew these using pen and paper. I did research on the molecules. My main reference is at the bottom of the comment. It’s an ACS publication.\n\nDetails on the chemistry: Tequila's chemistry has a diverse complexity of molecules. Agave sugars, like fructose and glucose, kickstart fermentation, while phenolic compounds such as vanillin and guaiacol offer vanilla and smoky notes. Fusel oils like isoamyl alcohol add fruity complexity, while polyphenols enhance color and potential health benefits. Terpenes like linalool bring floral aromas, while aldehydes like acetaldehyde offer fruity tastes. This intricate environment, enriched by terpenes, aldehydes, and ketones, creates a captivating symphony of flavors, making tequila a captivating blend of science and taste.\n\nHope you enjoy it!\n\nReference: “Quantification of Selected Volatile Constituents and Anions in Mexican Agave Spirits (Tequila, Mezcal, Sotol, Bacanora)” J.

    "body": "In Union Square in San Francisco, there’s an independent perfume store owned by an old French man.  He’s opinionated and a bit surly at times, but also kind and knowledgable.  I’ve heard him say “I don’t believe in notes in perfume.” (or something to that effect).  When I first heard it, I thought he was crazy.  Of course perfume has notes!  As I’ve gotten deeper into appreciating (and particularly making) perfume, I’ve started to realize that he might have a point.\n\nEveryone on the Internet talks about notes.  Perfume companies talk about notes.  They release marketing materials that list notes.  How could there not be notes?\n\nI’ll get to that, but first, a little bit of background:\n\n**What are fragrances actually made of?** \n\nFine Fragrances are generally made from a mixture of natural oils and aromachemicals diluted in alcohol (and possibly a touch of water).  Natural oils vary dramatically in price.  You can get an ounce of cedar oil for a couple of dollars, but an ounce on sandalwood could cost $100-$300 and an ounce of oud could cost $500-$2000.  Many commonly used oils are pretty inexpensive.  Bergamot (and other citruses), cedar, lavender, etc are all in the sub $10/oz range.  Natural oils are a blend of dozens or hundreds of aromachemicals.  Lavender oil, for example, contains linalool, linalyl acetate, pinene, caryophyllene, myrcene, and a bunch of other aromachemicals, most of which are available on their own.\n\nAromachemicals, on the other hand, are generally a single molecule.  Often they are chemicals that occur in nature that have just been synthesized in a lab or extracted from some inexpensive plant that contains it.  Linalool, for example, can be synthesized in a lab very cheaply.  For those who insist on linalool that was extracted from a natural source, it’s often taken from mint.  Some aromachemicals come almost exclusively from natural sources, like limonene, which is found in the oil of citrus peels.  The orange juice industry provides enough orange peel waste to cheaply provide natural limonene to anyone who wants it.  \n\nOften, an expensive natural will be replaced with a synthetic version of it’s “active ingredient.”  This is both to save money and because the synthetic, single ingredient can often smell cleaner and better than the natural.  Often the part of a smell that people like (like tonka bean) is actually just one of the chemicals in it (coumarin).  In fact, most of the time when “tonka bean” is listed as a note it’s really just coumarin. Similarly, ambroxan is one of the main chemicals that makes up ambergris (though it smells quite different to my nose)\n\nSome aromachemicals aren’t found in nature at all.  calone 1951 (the basis of most aquatic fragrances), hedione, dihydro myrcenal, Iso E super and galaxolide are examples.  In fact, these non-natural aromachemicals are in large part what makes modern fragrances smell modern.  I would guess that greater than 95% of all fragrances to come out in the last 20 years have at least one or two of these if not all.\n\nSome big companies like IFF, Firmench and Givaudan also make proprietary blends of aromachemicals to either reproduce a natural scent or create a new one.  They may do this for several different reasons.  Here are some examples from the manufacturer Givaudan with the reasons they exist:\n\n* Bergamot replacement - a bergamot replacement that is more stable, longer lasting and more hypoallergenic\n* Oakmoss replacement - a replacement for natural oakmoss that is more hypoallergenic and allowed to be used at higher levels than natural oakmoss by the IFRA.\n* Ultrazur  - a blue, watery marine note that is very long lasting and tenacious. The smell is unlike anything in nature (but if you’ve smelled fabric softener, you know what it smells like)\n* Sampaquita - a jasmine note that is very true to the smell of the flower.  It smells MUCH more like the fresh flower than the actual extracted absolute does.\n* Oud Blend - a replacement oud that smells pretty good when blended and costs $37/oz instead of $700/oz.  Many “Oud fragrances” are actually using this\n\n**So what does this have to do with notes?**\n\nPeople seem to treat notes like they’re ingredients.  They’re not.\n\nHere’s the thing.  Most modern fragrances consist MOSTLY of aromachemicals.  Often they are aromachemicals than have a natural equivalent, but often they don’t.  When you look as Fragrantica and marketing materials, they don’t (or very rarely) list aromachemicals.  Even if they do exist in nature, what do you call it when you mix citral with limonene and some orange terpenes and a touch of linalool in a ratio that kind of smells like a pleasant orangey-lemon thing?  Maybe you just put “citrus” on the notes.  Maybe you call it “orange.”  Maybe you call it “lemon.” Regardless, it was a marketing decision, not the listing of an ingredient.  \n\nWhat about when a fragrance contains a bunch of ionone alpha and methyl ionone?  These are both major ingredients in violets…but by themselves just smell violet-ish.  How do you list that in the notes?  Probably as “violet” even though there are neither violet flowers nor an actual violet flower replacement (like Sampaquita is a jasmine replacement).  Someone else might mix some other violet like chemicals together in a way that is reminiscent of other aspects on a violet and call that violet too.\nFun fact:  It takes a million violet flowers to make 1 kg of concrete, so violet flower absolute hasn’t been made in commercial quantities since the 1800’s.  EVERY commercial violet flower fragrance you’ve ever smelled has probably been synthetic. Same for your grandmother.\n\nThe examples above seem to be somewhat reasonable at least.  The notes seem to have something to do with the ingredients.  Now, though, lets look at some other examples.  What happens when aromachemicals that aren’t found in nature are used heavily?  They either give a note for a natural that smells kind of, sort of vaguely close…or just ignore it completely.\n\nTerre d’Hermes and A&F Fierce both have fragrance bases that are about 50% (HALF!) Iso E Super.  Where is that on the note listing?  What about when something smells strongly of dihydro myrcenal?  They just don’t list it. Or ambroxan.  Holy crap.  Once you know what ambroxan smells like, you can smell the person who spritzed themselves with Cool Water or Light Blue 8 hours ago..but it doesn’t show up on any of the note listings.  CK One should have Hedione listed as a prominent note.  It’s something like >20% of the fragrance base, but nope, nowhere to be found in the note listings\n\nQuite often the most defining characteristics of a fragrance don’t show up in the note listings, particularly if they don’t have  a familiar analog for the average person.\n\nMany traditional perfumery notes are made up entirely as well.  “Amber” is traditionally a blend of vanilla, labdanum, styrax and benzoin, not the petrified tree sap.  “Fougere” is the was someone imagined a fern should smell, but it’s really a mixture of oak moss, coumarin and lavender.  The “Leather” smell is a standardized artificial smell that is added to tanned animal products, originally to hide the smell of urine used in tanning.  It’s made of birch, cade, styrax, castoreum and a bunch of other stuff.\n\n**So what does all this mean for notes?**\n\nIt means that notes are not a list of ingredients.  They sometimes bear a resemblance to the ingredients in a fragrance, but not always.  They are the products of marketing people.  They are more an indication of the impressions that the perfume house wants you to have than an indication of how the fragrance actually smells.\n\nYou’ll notice that you can have 2 fragrances with very different notes that everyone says smell alike and 2 fragrances with almost identical notes that smell very differently.  \n\nIf you took natural oils for every note listed in Gucci Envy, or Light Blue or Green Irish Tweed and spent a lifetime mixing them you would never be able to create anything that smelled even close to the original because most of the ingredients that define it as a scent aren’t listed anywhere in the notes\n\nFragrance notes can definitely be useful, but that doesn’t mean that they’re accurate.\n\n**What if I want to learn about how these aromachemicals actually smell?  The REAL notes that make up fragrances…**\n\n[The Perfumer’s Apprentice sells a kit](http://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/p-6631-perfumery-notes-kit.aspx) for this exact purpose.\n",

I guess the best way I could related it is if you have a child and hear them cry. To non-parents a baby cry is a baby cry BUT after you have kids you can tell the difference between a tired cry, a hungry cry and i am in pain cry or just a plain cry for no reason but to cry and exercise. \n\nI would also put it down to background noise, rarely are we in a place where we do not hear the sounds of a city, our brains just filter it out but the noise is constantly there. \nWhile your point about made up smells is well taken its just a matter of common ground. The other scents become background noise and we just ignore them, while others  become important because we like them or have a personal experience  that enhances that particular odor. \n\nFinally I wonder is there a blog or something where amateur perfumers share various recipes. It would be very cool to make some classics like gucci envy etc.",

    "body": "It's relevant as we'll see in a bit. Some people have been wondering what Gofer was. Why?\n\nWell, even if you're a literalist, you'd still like to know what kind of wood the Ark was made of. \nSo first the term itself.\n\n>Gopher wood or gopherwood is a term used once in the Bible for the substance from which Noah's ark was built. **Genesis 6:14 states that Noah was to build the Ark of gofer**, more commonly transliterated as gopher wood, a word not otherwise known in the Bible or in Hebrew. Wikipedia\n\nAnd I'm just gonna dive right in.\n\nFirst Hebrew didn't have vowels the same way other languages do. So Gofer would have been written down as GFR. And that's a clue right there.\n\nNext clue?\n\nSame verse in Genesis...\n\n>rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.\" Genesis 6:14, NASB: ...\n\nPitch (together with wood) suggests resinous wood. Something perhaps like pine. The use of pine resin for making boats and ships water tight is well know. For example, Native American Indians used pine pitch in the construction of their marvelous canoes.\n\nSo now we've got a potential lead. Let's follow it and see if we can find something else to help make our case.\n\nPine and other evergreen trees are very fragrant. Anyone who's ever been close to any kind of pine or cedar tree knows exactly what I'm talking about. Same thing goes for being in a freshly built log cabin or even close to furniture made of such wood.\n\nWhy does it smell nice?\n\nMostly because of a range of chemical aromatic compounds like terpenes.\n\nCedar:  \n\n>The main chemical components of cedarwood oil are a-cedrene, b-cedrene, thujopsene, other sesquiterpenes, cedrol and widdrol.\n\nPine:\n\n>Chemically, pine oil consists mainly of α-terpineol and other cyclic terpene alcohols. It may also contain terpene hydrocarbons, ethers, and esters. The exact composition depends on various factors, such as the variety of pine from which it is produced and the parts of the tree used.\n\nAnd there's one more tree, the Gofer wood tree itself:\n\n> a-pinene, camphene, sabinene, b-pinene, d-3carene, myrcene, a-terpinene, terpinolene, linalool, bornyl acetate, cedrol and cadinene\n\nWhich tree is this? \n\nIt's the Cypress tree. \n\nCyprus is named after this tree. It grows all over the Holy Land as well. It was imported from there to Italy by the Etruscans\n\n>The cypress tree is synonymous with Tuscany, although it is not native to Italy. The cypress probably came to Tuscany thousands of years ago, likely with Etruscan tribes. The Etruscans revered the cypress because they thought it had supernatural powers.\n\nNot so much supernatural as healthy and emotionally uplifting (basically ancient aromatherapy). And it gets even more convincing if we look at the origin for the name itself.\n\n#cypress\n\n>/ˈsʌɪprəs/\n\n\n>Origin\n\n>Middle English: from Old French cipres, from late Latin cypressus, **from Greek kuparissos** .\n\nFrom the Greek Kuparissos... or kupar - issos\n\nKupar means the same thing as the semitic Gofer or  (later Arabic) Qafoor. In Sanskrit, there is a word for the same substance called Kapoor. And what is this stuff?\n\nWe call it Camphor.\n\nAnd Cypress trees have camphor.\n\n>Camphor is a waxy, flammable, transparent solid with a strong aroma. It is a terpenoid with the chemical formula C₁₀H₁₆O. It is found in the wood of the camphor laurel, a large evergreen tree found in East Asia, also of the unrelated kapur tree, a tall timber tree from the same region. Wikipedia\n\nCypress was named after the way it smells. I couldn't say which name came first, the tree or the smell... it's a chicken and egg thing. But that's a side track. The Greek name kuparissos is like a description that means kupar-ish. In English we'd say camphoraceous (which is phonetically similar to kuparissos)\n\nGofer = Qafoor = Kupar (cypress) = Camphor  \n\nMystery solved.\n\nIt just so happens that I have a cypress tree growing right outside my front door. It's there because my wife likes those trees and it was her idea to plant it. I'm looking at it differently now every time I walk by.\n\nEdit: Another user asked me a question and I expanded/explained a bit more.

    "body": "You want to know if it worked...I'm burying the lede here. Stay with me though.\n\nI have not had a chance to read the papers K18's team wrote in the last 10 years, so I decided to do this \"part 1\" with current results, then a part 2 with paper/patent comments plus how my hair fared in an upcoming bleaching service.\n\nK18 is a post-wash leave-in treatment applied on towel-dried hair. The claim is \"...molecular breakthrough clinically proven to reverse hair damage in 4 minutes\" from bleach, dyeing, heat, other chemical services like perms.\n\nAnd\n\n>Traveling into the inner-most layers of hair to reach the core polypeptide chains (keratin chains), our revolutionary K18Peptide™ is just the right size and makeup to fit in and reconnect broken chains.\n\nIngredients as of this writing:\n\nWater, Alcohol Denat., Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Ether, Cetyl Esters, Behentrimonium Chloride, Polysorbate 20, sh-Oligopeptide-78 (K18Peptide™), Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Starch, Isopropyl Alcohol, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Fragrance, Geraniol, Linalool, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Alcohol.\n\nIt is sold in 5 ml sample sizes or 50 ml full size. The pump pushes out about 1ml of product and anywhere from 1 to 4+ pumps is needed for the treatment depending on hair length, volume, & strand thickness. The lotion goes over clean but not conditioned towel-dried hair. Once applied, it needs to sit on hair for 4 minutes before using any other product.\n\nThe instructions are to use every time you wash your hair for 4 to 6 washes. If using a lot of product (no explanation on how 'heavy product use' is defined), the website text recommends a clarifying shampoo before application. After the initial 4-6 applications, the rate is 1 application every 3 to 4 washes.\n\nPros (and DOES IT WORK?):\n\nK18 improved the look and feel of my bleached hair ends, and the hair ends curled with no coaxing needed and felt soft/shiny again. The time my hair takes to dry without products shortened by 1.5 hours. Frizz diminished. Squishing my hair after washing produced less water. And I got to day 4 curly hair, which had not happened to me, ever.\n\nI saw significant change after application #4. I had committed to doing 6 washes/applications, so I continued. Areas of my hair that had been bleached more than the rest showed improvement last.\n\nLike Olaplex, K18 does something good, but I cannot state that it does what it claims (insert peptide chain in cortex, have peptide chain chemically link up bits and pieces in cortex). I did not test elasticity.\n\nK18 significantly improved hydrophobicity. Based on the list of ingredients I bet there is heavy adsorbtion of cationics going on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLess pro, but not cons:\n\n1. The amount to apply is tiny, and spreading it throughout the hair is challenging because one cannot see where product has been applied versus where it has not, plus the product is all over your palms, so cannot feel, either. For my hair I needed 4-5 pumps (4-5 ml), so I applied in sections, ends first, and hoped for the best.\n2. For people whose curly hair routine includes putting styling products in sopping wet hair, or not touching curls, using K18 requires rethinking all that as it is applied on clean towel dried hair, and must  be applied before any other hair product.\n3. If you co-wash, I would suggest using a shampoo that does not deposit much of anything on the hair prior to using K18\n4. The dosing chart is hidden on the product page (you must select the accordion chevron--the arrow pointing down-- to the right of \"how to use\"  to see the text)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAssorted: If buying the 50 ml product in the US, your cost is $1.50/pump. The 5 ml sample cost is $2.40/pump. Also, their customer service answered my questions pretty fast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWill I buy again? \n\nEDITED 5 /8 / 2022: Link to Part 2: [https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/ule42z/k18\\_my\\_experience\\_part\\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/ule42z/k18_my_experience_part_2/)",

    "body": "—INTRODUCTION—\n\nPeople start looking into no-, low-, and natural-poo for a variety of reasons.  For whatever reason, we do have a tendency to let our beliefs and emotional reactions (feels) get in the way of facts (reals).\n\nThere’s a link in the sidebar to a page about “Essential Oils in Haircare”.  This set off crazy warning bells: essential oils are not something with which to be tinkering around.  This is about 7000 times more true if they are being used topically, rather than for aromatherapy, which is how the linked website (and many of this subreddit’s users) recommend using them.\n\nJust because something is “natural” or derived from a plant does not mean it’s a-okay for your skin.  There’s no market out there for poison ivy tea rinses, after all.  I want to work through (for now) the oils specifically mentioned on the linked page, since that is what the subreddit “advocates” or is, at least, what most users will find when looking into essential oil use.\n\n—THE LINE-UP—\n\nBASIL: first up, this essential oil has some compounds that are going to be old friends by the time we get through this: linalool and eugenol.  This are BOTH documented irritants that you should avoid in any skin care product. (http://www.aromaweb.com/essential-oils/basil-oil.asp), (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/eugenol), (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/linalool)\n\nCHAMOMILE: this one checks out; it doesn’t appear to be widely irritating in general, though some people with allergies to the daisy family may have issues. (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/chamomile)\n\nCEDARWOOD: this is a fragrance, and like many fragrances, can be irritating and allergenic.  There is also, apparently, some research which found it to cause tumors on mouse skin.  The evidence is far, far from conclusive, and even if there were more studies with similar results, “correlation is not causation” would still apply.  However, if you’re going to freak out about parabens or whatever, it doesn’t make sense to use cedarwood oil. (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/cedarwood)\n\nCLARY SAGE: this is tagged with the Risk Number* R38, marking it as irritating to the skin.  Don’t put it on your scalp, fer Pete’s sake. (http://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB9340183.htm)\n\nEUCALYPTUS: this is a fragrant oil which, as the sidbar-linked website says, may well have some anti-fungal and anti-microbial effects.  HOWEVER, some of its components are known irritants.  \"Truly a mixed bag, because this oil, like rosemary oil, is one that has benefits and risks. Because the risks are primarily with topical application to skin, eucalyptus oil is an ingredient to avoid” (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/eucalyptus-oil)\n\nLAVENDER:  STOOOOOOOOOOOOP putting lavender essential oil anywhere near your skin. The “tingling” feeling that many people describe isn’t lavender oil stimulating your bloodflow or anything, it’s the oil irritating and damaging your skin.  You do NOT want to experience tingling with any product you apply topically: it is your body sending you distress signals.  Lavender is so, so misunderstood, so I’m going to quote the whole article:  \n\n\"Of particular concern is the lavender oil, which smells great but causes havoc on skin. Research indicates that components of lavender, specifically linalool, can be cytotoxic, which means that topical application causes skin-cell death (Source: Cell Proliferation, June 2004, pages 221–229). Lavender leaves contain camphor, which is a known skin irritant. Because the fragrance constituents in lavender oil oxidize when exposed to air, lavender oil is a pro-oxidant, and this enhanced oxidation increases its irritancy on skin (Source: Contact Dermatitis, September 2008, pages 143–150). Lavender oil is the most potent form, and even small amounts of it (0.25% or less) are problematic. Although it’s fine as an aromatherapy agent for inhalation or relaxation, it is a must to avoid in skin-care products. (Sources: Psychiatry Research, February 2007, pages 89–96; and www.naturaldatabase.com).\"\n\n(http://www.paulaschoice.com/beautypedia-skin-care-reviews/by-brand/bio-oil/_/Bio-Oil)\n\nLEMON: this provides no demonstrated skin care benefits, but can be both irritating and photo toxic, i.e. reactions may result following exposure to sunlight.  (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/lemon-oil)\n\nLEMONGRASS: this is another fragrant, volatile oil which contains the same compounds that make lemon oil (above) irritating to the skin. ( http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/lemongrass-oil)\n\nMYRRH: another one that contains limonene, an irritant also found in the two oils above, as well as pinene (see “volatile oil\" description below) and eugenol, which you also don’t want on your body. (http://www.baseformula.com/product.php/6670/myrrh-essential-oil), (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/eugenol)\n\nPATCHOULI: this is derived from mint, can sensitize skin, and contains eugenol (see myrrh, above) which is an irritant.  Patchouli is considered a “counter irritant”, for which see below for a full explanation. (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/patchouli)\n\nPEPPERMINT: it’s another counter-irritant; move along. (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/peppermint)\n\nROSEMARY: this one kind of almost barely checks out.  In very, very small quantities rosemary EXTRACT can be okay, but if you look at the main constituents of rosemary OIL, it’s a whole lot of known irritants: pinene, borneol, linalol, camphor, etc. (http://www.aromaweb.com/essential-oils/rosemary-oil.asp), (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/antioxidants/rosemary-extract)\n\nSAGE: I feel like this is starting to get repetitive: it’s a fragrant oil, and all the usual, skin-annoying compounds are there, including camphor.  Nope.  (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/sage-extract)\n\nTEA TREE: Fiiiiiiiiiinally!  This one kind of checks out too!  It can have anti-inflammatory effects and seems effective at treating certain skin conditions.  However, that doesn’t mean you should go whapping it all over your head: it still contains components that can cause issues, so it should STILL be treated with extreme caution.  (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/tea-tree-oil1)\n\nTHYME: once again, fragrance compounds found in thyme oil are undesirable on your skin.  Billionth verse, same as the first, no?  (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/thyme-oil)\n\nYLANG YLANG: allllllllllll together now!  It’s a fragrant oil made up of compounds known to cause skin issues!  Skip it!  (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/ylang-ylang)\n\n—IN CONCLUSION—\n\nMany people who avoid shampoo do so because they feel it contains too many “harsh” or “irritating” chemicals.  Swapping out a rigorously-tested, carefully-formulated shampoo only to start smearing essential oils (chemicals) over your head is, however, nonsensical.  Not that you can’t do it, of course; it’s your body.  If, however, you’re going to invoke science in defense of any part of your regime (often done in no-poo-land), why not apply that standard consistently?  “Diluting” these oils with carriers may help, but these compounds can be problematic for skin even in tiny quantities in professionally-made products.  If you’re avoiding shampoo to limit your exposure to chemicals and irritants, why risk the above-listed essential oils\n\n—ADDITIONAL NOTES AND DEFINITIONS—\n\nVOLATILE OIL: \"Group of volatile fluids derived primarily from plants and used in cosmetics primarily as fragrant additives. These components most often include a mix of alcohols, ketones, phenols, linalool, borneol, terpenes, camphor, pinene, acids, ethers, aldehydes, and sulfur, all of which have extremely irritating and sensitizing effects on skin.” (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/volatile-oil)\n\nCOUNTER-IRRITANT: \"Ingredients such as menthol, peppermint, camphor, and mint are counter-irritants (Sources: Archives of Dermatologic Research, May 1996, pages 245–248; and Code of Federal Regulations Title 21—Food and Drugs, revised April 1, 2001, CITE: 21CFR310.545, www.fda.gov). Counter-irritants are used to induce local inflammation for the purpose of relieving inflammation in deeper or adjacent tissues. In other words, they substitute one kind of inflammation for another, which is never good for skin. Irritation or inflammation, no matter what causes it or how it happens, impairs the skin’s immune and healing response (Source: Skin Pharmacology and Applied Skin Physiology, November–December 2000, pages 358–371). And although your skin may not show it or doesn’t react in an irritated fashion, if you apply irritants to your skin the damage is still taking place and is ongoing, so it adds up over time (Source: Skin Research and Technology, November 2001, pages 227–237).”  \n(http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/counter-irritant)\n\nRISK NUMBERS: an explanation can be found here (https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/newsletter/essential_oils_handle_with_care.php)\n",

        "body": "hey so while all of this info is super accurate regarding undiluted essential oils, i feel that it's important to mention that most of these are completely safe diluted below about 5%. tea tree oil, for example, is an effective antimicrobial at concentrations as low as .25%, and diluted in another carrier oil, it's highly unlikely that it's going to cause any negative effects. \n\nyou should never put undiluted essential oil of any kind directly on your skin for any reason!!! but for the vast majority of essential oils, at concentrations around 5% or lower, the benefits (and nice smells) are present without negative effects like irritation. \n\ni'm typing with one hand right now because a kitten is asleep in my lap so i can't easily source this comment but if you look through my comment history or search in /r/SkincareAddiction, this gets discussed a lot (esp. tea tree oil) and you'll find a lot of articles and stuff with more info.",

        "body": "You took a lot of time to write this out, and I'm grateful for your references, and the general warning you're giving, but I feel like you're overstating a couple of things here.  \n\nHere's the general tone of your piece:  \"natural\" and \"safe\" are two different words.  This is a true statement, and I'm glad someone is pointing this out.\n\nThat said, I wanted to point out a couple of things to anyone who may still read this thread.  What makes something toxic or damaging is amount, and that can be said for everything ranging from resiniferatoxin to normal water.  While there are definitely going to be stupid or ignorant people that use essential oils in an unsafe manner, most of them have safe levels associated with use.  In other words, diluted down sufficiently, there's nothing on the list you've provided that *can't* be safely used for lotions, shampoos, and bath oils, and some, like lavender, are *so* safe that they're regularly used in baby lotions.  \n\nEveryone isn't going to be rolling to EO use with a solid chemistry background, so mentioning that certain things cause sensitization (like the wood oils) more rapidly than others is definitely worth noting.  But even with that in mind, almost everything you listed makes regular appearances in commercial perfumes, so they've been tried and tested in the population.  \n\nLastly, I wanted to point out that your concept of skin irritant is a little off.  Inducing local inflammation isn't the horrible thing you seem to think it is, in fact, products containing a number of the ingredients above are recommended for multiple-times-daily use by doctors for treatment of pain (like from sore muscles and arthritis).  The proportion of eugenol and linalool and other potentially irritating compounds is so low in most of the ones you've listed that dilution is sufficient to all but eliminate risk.  The remaining risk is the same for any new scented product you'd buy, including tested deodorant soaps and shampoos.  \n\nJust don't use EO's undiluted, ever, and follow established protocols for reduction, and people will be fine including them in whatever homemade hair or skin tonic they wish.",

    "body": "I largely reduced my anxiety 75%. Terrible panic attacks, unable to talk to people. Unable to even go outside at my worst. Being largely stable feels so good.\n\nI tried hundreds of herbals, nootropic drugs, psychiatric drugs prescribed by doctors and was met largely by disappointment and steadily worsening anxiety and panic attacks. The doctors have no idea what it's like and just think you're trying to get some opiates. Kind of nasty feeling that way but it's understandable considering the crises. Since I understood the nuerochemistry of how opiates work I was terrified of them and didn't want them anyway. At most I was willing to try them on an as needed basis during a bad panic. I was never prescribed them and was instead thrown onto the silly anti depressant roller coaster ride.\n\nWeight gain, mood swings, and over sedation that didn't address the panic, and a psychotic event triggered by adderall (to address adhd) of all things. That's the last time I ever took a stimulant. After countless antidepressants I read the side effects and user reports on the cymbalta they were trying to get me on and had enough of the docs. \n\nHere is my supplement journal. I set weeks aside and tested all of these independently from one another:\n\nI highly encourage you to do your own research and understand that everything carries a risk.\n\n **What worked:**\n\n* daytime\n   * **taurine** (proven to be a light gaba ^(a) receptor agonist) (highly effective at 2g doses within a 4 hour period, any more within that time frame causes stomach discomfort)\n   * **5htp** (provides fast acting relief from anxiety when administered sublingually leading me to believe I have a serotonin deficiency)(no longer take daily as I take tryptophan instead)\n   * **l-tryptophan** (500mg per day is well tolerated and accompanied by a noticeable reduction in anxiety) \n   * **vitamin b6** (250mg)(noticeable effect on my anxiety without any feeling of lethargy or sedation.)(your body uses vitamin b6 as a cofactor with tryptophan in order to create serotonin.)\n   * **zinc** (effective at reducing anxiety in a non sedating way, 25mg is well tolerated, 50mg and over gave me migraines initially.) after 1 week of supplementation i no longer got migraines and was able to up my dose to therapeutic dose of 100mg per day for up to a week.)\n   * **fasoracetam** (80mg)(research chemical)(increases gaba ^(b) receptors and promotes the release of acetylcholine)(warning: as this is a new racetam this is the only risky one on the list)(takes time but definite noticeable improvement)\n   * **magnesium glycinate** 400mg/daily, noticeable decrease in my anxiety.\n   * **iron** 50mg: low levels of iron are known to cause anxiety.\n   * **multivitamin**: just to be sure an anemia wasn't causing my anxiety.\n* nighttime\n   * **omega fish oil** \n   * **high dose gaba** (strong sleep inducer, rids you of some anxiety but brings about a strong sense of lethargy)\n   * **chrysin** (some anxiety relief accompanied by a feeling of lethargy and loss of focus. could make for a good sleep aid) (reportedly inhibits estrogen conversion from testosterone)\n* habits\n   * ***lesser blue light exposure***\n   * ***intermittent fasting***\n   * ***ketogenic diet***\n   * ***yoga + meditation***\n   * ***breathing techniques***\n   * ***high intesity exercises***\n   * ***accupressure***\n   * ***reduce pmo***\n   * ***avoid politics or philosophy*** (there's a time and a place but these subjects do nothing for a mind at extreme unease.)\n\n ***The stuff that didn't work:*** \n\n* **phenibut:** addictive and works wonders but I ended up abusing it and dosing high. It's so tempting to dose high and just be free of the monster that is anxiety. stuff made me feel like a kid again. I would stay far away unless you know you do not have an addictive personality.\n* **propranolol:** received a script to no effect. apparently my anxiety is not triggered by a strong adrenal response.\n* **dextroamp-amphetamin:** threw me into a full blown panic attack and consequent psychosis.\n* **n-acetyl l-tyrosyne:**  noticeably worsened my anxiety. my dopamine to serotonin ratio must be out of balance as i cannot cope with anything stimulating dopamine or norepinephrine.\n* **holy basil, l-theanine, rhodiola blend** (total calm brand): anxiety remained unaffected with some accompanying lethargy. good for sleep but no benefits for daytime use.\n* **glycine**, i purchased 1 kg of the stuff thinking it would reduce anxiety. turns out glycine can also be stimulating for reasons i don't understand too well. made me noticeably more anxious for 3 hours after supplementing. I put aside several days of only glycine supplementation to test this to the same effect.\n* ***some redeemable qualities for anxiety or insomnia:***\n   * **chrysin**: failed as an anxiolytic but perhaps shows promise in inhibiting estrogen\n      * (passion flower extract) raises testosterone and is a GABAᵃ receptor agonist.\n   * **SAMe** (ineffective in the short term for anxiety at least, nothing uncomfortable)\n   * **aniracetam**\n   * **bacoppa monnieri*****:*** upregulates gaba ^(a) in mice, had no noticeable effect on anxiety. perhaps long term there could be a noticeable difference.\n   * **valerian root**, minuscule reduction in anxiety accompanied by a great feeling of lethargy. better sleep aid than daytime anxiolytic.\n   * **turmeric**, no noticeable difference in anxiety\n   * **linalool oil** (500mg pill):  (lowers glutamate) very large reduction in anxiety accompanied by a lot of lethargy and loss of focus. I also read afterwards that this stuff potentially nukes your microbiome so be careful.)\n   * **thiamin b1** \\- no real noticeable effect on anxiety but it remains a part of my dietary supplementation.\n   * **apigenin** \\- A flavinoid found in chamomile and passionflower responsible for their sedative effects. Strong anxiolytic effect on general anxiety, not much of a pro social. It lasts about an hour and has a terrible rebound effect. Maybe there is something to taking this with the other flavinoids that would create a better, longer lasting entourage effect without a rebound anxiety.\n\n***Stuff I'm currently in the process of testing:***\n\n* n-acetyl-l-cystine NAC\n* alpha gpc/uridine\n* picamilon \n* terpenes\n* huperzine a\n* noopept\n* lemon balm\n* five herbs to promote healthy levels of gaba:  passion flower, valerian, california poppy, chamomile, and skull cap\n* german chamomile\n* electrolytes\n* rhodiola\n* *sulbutiamine (isobutyryl thiamine disulfide)* is a synthetic derivative of [Vitamin B1 (thiamine)](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-b1-thiamine/).

I love the story behind this company and so was super keen to support West Coast Palms bringing out strains with such an ethical source with a moving story. ✌️\n\nMAC doughnuts is a cross between the legendary miracle alien cookies x powdered donuts 🍩 and a very exciting new release for the many MAC lovers in our community. \n\nOpening the tub I was hit by powerful and enticing sweet and fruity notes with elements of baked goods and citrus, sugar and spice 🥰 def a tub I keep smelling to identify the complex and layered notes. Yum!\n\nThe taste in my vape beautifully translates the above mentioned notes with an addition of sweet gas on the exhale. There is a robust amount of Vapor and I have found 185-195 a sweet spot for the taste and effects. \n\nVisually the buds are very appealing. Very dense and squishy and full of life. The buds are extremely frosty and sticky and have a milky hue with orange pistils. Visually it’s beautiful and very fresh. Buds are mostly medium sized. It grinds up very fluffy, just lovely ☺️ \n\nMAC doughnuts is hand picked, hand trimmed, hand packed, Coco + LED, hang dried and cold cured 🏆 all the hallmarks of craft cannabis ✅\n\nThe effects are quick with a strong onset of euphoria and upbeat vibes. This is highly recommended for anyone looking to improve their mood and well being. It’s powerful and euphoric high is great for lifting my mood and boosting my energy levels, and I would place it in my late afternoon/evening rotation for mood boost and relaxation. I find the effects to have great legs and the initial mood boost lasted at least two hours before noticing any effects wearing off ☮️ \n\nThis is highly recommended for those seeking a very cerebral experience, and for me it has balanced hybrid effects which makes it quite versatile.\n\nThis is a very unique and exciting new release, and for $130 10g it’s a very high end craft offering at a very reasonable price.\n\nI have a script for West Coast Palms BlackBerry Pie and am very much looking forward to that being released this coming week.\n\nFri-yay is for MAC Doughnuts, have a lovely weekend MCOZ 🌿💚🫶🏽\n\n",

This is a great grown, tasty, and effective day smoke for me 😋  lovely terps kinda similar to the white hot guava but less citrus more fizziness if that makes sense....\ndefinitely try, it's a banga...Nd for $105 at the best pharmacy going around Heathershaws of course( thanks Jenny and Gav will help you out to the best of their ability  these guys are extremely knowledgeable and helpful and I couldn't ask for anything more 😊❤️❤️\n\nReally glad someone is getting some use from the flower tho 🙌👌👌",

The “Glycerol” product page title is a typo, as there is no glycerol in there.\n\n-\n\nRetinol & Niacinamide toner http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_9b0a443774.html\n\n> Aqua, Niacinamide, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Betaine, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Citrate, Ethylhexylglycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Panthenol, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxyacetophenone, Parfum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Jasminum Officinale Extract, Poloxamer 235, Retinol, Sodium Ascorbate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Epigallocatechin Gallate, Rosmarinus Officinalis Leaf Oil, BHT, Lavandula Angustifolia Oil, BHA, Jasminum Officinale (Jasmine) Oil, Linalool, Coumarin. \n\nRetinol is quite low down but this has 5% Niacinamide, so it should be a good “lots of Niacinamide but not as hefty as 10% Niacinamide” product, replacing the Simple soothing toner which never specified the exact content but has been reformulated to have less active ingredient since I last tested it, so here are some new tests and ingredients: https://imgur.com/a/QJhFAxZ\n\n-\n\nRose & hyaluronic acid toner http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_65a8443777.html\n\n> Aqua, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sambucus Nigra Flower Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Glycerin, Polysorbate 20, Propylene Glycol, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Parfum, Allantoin, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Sodium PCA, Bisabolol, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice Powder, Sodium Hyaluronate, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Hydroxide, Citronellol, Geraniol. \n\n-\n\n-\n\nRose oil http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8dcc443757.html\n\n> Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil, Punica Granatum Seed Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Parfum, Tocopherol, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis Peel Extract, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Citronellol, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate.\n\nHappy to see there are no plastics or silicones in there. Like the Pixi one it’s mostly almond and jojoba oil, plus (with the help of google) pomegranate, rosehip, vit E, orange peel extract, “sweet scented geranium”(?), rose flower oil, various fragrances. Wasn’t sure if there was any point testing this, as oils are said to “not have pH” (what) but this does appear to have a pH of approx. 5 (~face pH) https://imgur.com/rkvQeer\n\nI didn’t buy the Pixi version as it’s still £17+ on offer (at that point no), ingredients can be found at https://www.boots.com/pixi-rose-oil-blend-10256339\n\n-\n\nThese were all released in store today, toners are still available online and Aldi seem to have made more of them this time around. Rose oil is sold out online, *might* have to be quick to get it in the store.",

    "body": "They released an article a few weeks ago about farm-to-face beauty products. My feelings about the movement towards \"natural\" aside, the writer recommended a $60 cleansing oil, and included this following line:\n\n> [It's paraben-, preservative- and chemical-free, and smells divine.] (https://www.refinery29.com/2018/01/189611/natural-ethical-beauty-products-farm-to-face#slide-1) \n\nI am taking offense at the preservative-free claim. This is not only factually wrong, this is extremely dangerous.\n\nLet me make this clear: the marketing copy for this product doesn't claim to be preservative-free. The copy brags about having AHA and plant extracts, but they don't claim to be [preservative-free] (https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/african-botanics-pure-marula-cleansing-oil.html). If the company did, they would have been wrong. \n\nThis is the ingredient list: \n\n>Glycerin, Capric/Caprylic Triglycerides, Aqua, Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Diisopropyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Sorbitan Oleate, Sclerocarya Birrea (Marula) Seed Oil\\*\\*, Moringa Pterygosperma (Moringa) Seed Oil\\*\\*, Adansonia Digitata (Baobab) Seed Oil\\*\\*, Isoamyl Laurate, Lauryl Glucoside, Coco Glucoside, Eriocephalus punctulatus (Chamomile Cape) Essential Oil, Citrus Paradisi (Pink Grapefruit) Essential Oil, Vaccinium Myrtillus (Bilberry) Extract, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugar Cane) Extract, Acer Saccahrinum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Extract, Tocopherol Acetate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Benzyl Benzoate\\*, Citral\\*, Citronellal\\*, Geraniol\\*, Limonene\\*, Linalool\\*. \\*Constituents Of Natural Essential Oils Used. \\*\\*Certified Organic. 100% Vegan. Gluten-free.\n\nGuess what? Both dehydroacetic acid and benzyl alcohol are used as preservatives. So the writer's claim about preservative-free is factually wrong.\n\nHere's the bigger issue, though: cosmetic products need preservative systems. \n\nYou cannot sell an unsafe product. Cosmetics are often a mixture of oils and water, which is perfect breeding ground for disease agents like mold and bacteria and viruses and fungi. This means that you cannot sell a product without an adequate preservative system. These germs need to be killed, or you will sicken someone, if not kill them. \n\nEven if you did your best to disinfect the manufacturing equipment, and even if all of the employees involved in manufacture practice safe manufactory practices, bacteria and mold can still get in. Plus, as a consumer uses the product, it will accumulate bacteria, fungi and mold over time. If these are allowed to grow unimpeded, this can change the color, scent, texture, etc of the product. Consumers like having a product that lasts as long as possible. As such, it is very important to have a system in place to preserve the product, not only to preserve human health, but to keep a product usable for as long as possible. \n\nTherefore, suggesting that a product 100% lacks preservatives, and implying that this is a good thing, is extremely irresponsible. By suggesting that having no system in place is more ethical, natural, or safe, you are endangering people's lives. Additionally, you are forcing your readers to spend more money on products than they need to, simply because preservative systems are necessary for it to last long enough for it to be used up. \n\n(I will note that there are products that claim to be self-preserving; these products don't use traditional preservatives, but they still have a system in place. Whether these are adequate is outside the scope of this post, but even the natural cosmetic lines agree that preserving products is a good thing.)\n\nAlso, the chemical-free line is just wrong. All matter is chemical. Oil is a chemical, extracts are chemicals, water is a chemical... ",

    "body": "Hi All,\n\n\n\nSomeone posted a thread asking for an affordable sunscreen recommendation, and I thought I'd share the comment again.\n\nI actually made a post about it last year, but obviously it's gone to the bottom of the list. I hope it's okay to post about it again, since summer is very soon.\n\n\nI also kind of want more people to buy it. It feels sad that not many people know about it, when in my opinion it's really good. I have tried la Roche posay, nivea uv face, and I really think this one is better. But of course be careful and check the ingredient list!\n\n\nHere was my comment:\n\n\nI really like the asda sun cream which I have been using for 2 years now since discovering it one day - ASDA Protect SPF 50+ Face Q10 Anti-Age Sun Cream. I have the most sensitive skin, probably one of the most sensitive skin types you will ever meet due to my chronic eczema, and this one doesn't irritate me at all. To be honest, in the last year my eczema has been under control, and I was using this, so I can't say that it worsened my skin.\n\n\nIts only £2.40 so I think it's worth a try, and its UVA rating is very high- more than my nivea face uv sunscreen for £15ish (which burns my eyes). The only issue is that it's not matte. For me that's ok, as it covers my cracked and flaky skin. But you might want to try their matte version, which is the same price. If you want to try this one I am happy to take a picture/video of its consistency for you?\n\n\nHere are its ingredients:\nAqua, Octocrylene, Glycerin, Alcohol Denat., C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Titanium Dioxide (Nano), Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Tapioca Starch, Coco-Caprylate, Undecane, Tocopheryl Acetate, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Silica, Panthenol, Caprylyl Glycol, Parfum, Tridecane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Xanthan Gum, Dimethicone, Disodium EDTA, Ubiquinone, Sodium Hydroxide, Carbomer, Benzyl Alcohol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Citronellol, Limonene, Tocopherol, Linalool, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil\n\n\n\nI hope this helps, and good luck.",

        "body": "Hey OP, just wanted to give my opinion on this. After seeing this post I went out and grabbed some as I have an ASDA close-by. I have dry-normal sensitive skin and wanted to give it a try considering the great price. Only been using it today so its only a first impression but so far, so good! \n\nNo cast, sinks in nicely though it did leave me a bit greasy initially but after 10 mins or so it faded and looked normal, can barely tell I even had it on. I cut out my morning moisturizer as I figured it would be rich enough to cover that as well and I was right. I definitely wouldn't moisturize then apply this, the SPF is all I need. \n\nI have notoriously sensitive eyes so admittedly I haven't tried it in that area yet as I had to go out and didn't want to risk burning eyes so I used my usual SPF (the bondi sands one) and then applied the ASDA one everywhere else and I've had no issues. \n\nI will be trying it around the eyes tomorrow though as I'm not going anywhere. You may have just saved me a lot of future money OP so thanks! Even if it doesn't work around the eyes I can at least apply it to the rest of the face and use my usual in that area meaning it will last longer so its win/win really.\n\nUPDATE: So I've now tried it around the eyes and it felt fine for the first couple of hours, however after that I did experience some very mild burning in the eye area. Having said that, when I say \"very mild\" I mean really, really mild. If I was out and about I probably wouldn't even notice it as it only lasted a couple of minutes and then stopped. \n\nI would still class this as a success. Mild for me is still an improvement over most SPF's I've tried since my eyes are so sensitive. I will continue to use this and possibly just use my usual SPF around my eyes and the ASDA one on the rest of my face. Which will make my more expensive one last a lot longer since its only going to be used in the eye area.",

I also live in Spain, where the UV index can go as high as 11 most days during this time of the year.\n\nI've tried like 30 different sunscreens in the past 3 years (I only started wearing sunscreen in 2022.. oops), and let me tell you...this is *good* stuff. With pretty much every other sunscreen, I'd come back home looking red as hell - yes, even reapplying and using generous amounts! (for example, last summer I used Vichy UV-Age daily during a heavy exposure day, as it has really high UVA protention and claims to be waterproof, and while I didn't get a sunburn, my face was giving tomato by the end of the day.. a shame, as I loved both the texture and finish). I've tried pretty much all the other popular European sunscreens like all the LRP UVMune sunscreens, which my skin just says no to every single time, especially the invisible fluid which makes me flush every single time with no exception, right after I put it on... the only one that works for me from the UVMune line is the Oil-Control gel cream but the texture isn't ideal and it doesn't prevent my skin from getting red. \n\nI bought this one last summer (the original formula before they reformulated it a few months ago) and it was life changing. I was able to go out in the middle of June and my face didn't have a hint of redness by the end of the day. I must've finished like 3 or 4 bottles last year alone. Then fall and winter came and I switched to Korean sunscreens for a while as they are more hydrating and I skip moisturiser during the day.\n\nWell, it is once again hot as hell (to the point I literally start sweating walking from room to room), so I bought the new formula, which honestly feels and looks identical, and I've been using it for the past couple weeks and once again, my skin just eats it up. I can go out when the UV index is like 6 or 7 without triggering any redness. I can also sweat in peace as it's waterproof and it doesn't come out easily (make sure you double cleanse at night).\n\n**Finish:** Natural leaning towards matte. even during Spanish summer in which most sunscreens leave me looking like a disco ball. I can re-apply 2-3 times and it still doesn't look or feel greasy.\n\n**Application:** Extremely fluid, think of like ISDIN fusion water or LRP UVMune, but not sticky at all. Super easy to spread.\n\n**Smell:** Very subtle, smells like peaches and summer. it does contain the likes of limonene and linalool, so avoid this sunscreen if you’re allergic to essential oils. The smell disappears almost immediately after and doesn’t linger all day, though.\n\n**Alcohol:** Yes, but it's only the 9th ingredient so not really drying unless you're sensitive to it\n\n**Whitecast:** Not on me as Fitzpatrick 2. Sunscreens with Tinosorb M or TriAsorB do leave me looking like a ghost and this one doesn't at all, so keep in that mind. \n\n**Eyes**: No stinging, but then again I never get any stinging from pretty much any sunscreen I've tried.\n\n**Whitecast on beard/eyebrows:** No.\n\n**Filters:** Octisalate, Uvinul A Plus, Tinosorb S, Zinc Oxide (Nano), Titanium Dioxide (Nano)\n\n**Antioxidants:** Polypodium Leucotomos Leaf Extract, Ginger Root Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol\n\n**Soothing ingredients:** Panthenol, SymCalmin, Bisabolol\n\nI wonder if the physical filters are doing the heavy lifting here and preventing my face from getting red (but they are nano, so I doubt it). Or maybe it's the antioxidants? I'm honestly super curious, as the filters are pretty standard. Either way, good stuff. I never see anyone outside of Spain talk about this sunscreen (or Heliocare in general), so thought I'd share!\n\n",

But this is not about existing allergies.\n\nThere's this one skin care influencer I follow who, when commenting on a cream, said that it shouldn't be used because of the added fragrances (fair, as it contains limonene and linalool) and because it contains lanolin, which is quite irritating and known to trigger allergies.\n\nI swear, there was a record scratch happening. I had never heard of that before. Which doesn't have to mean shit, because I don't spend my time researching ingredients, neither for a living nor as a hobby. And I only realised how irritating SLS and limonene can (!) be, because I did a deep dive.\n\nAn admittedly perfunctory search yielded the result that usually lanolin is well tolerated. Yes, allergies to lanolin do it exist, but people can also be allergic to silicone, which is supposed to be hypoallergenic. So nothing's 100% safe, I guess.\n\nDid I miss anything? Should I ditch that cream (and others containing lanolin as the key ingredient) going forward because it will just cause allergies? Or is that kinda bs, because while allergies exist, lanolin is not allergenic? Or maybe, as is often the case, the truth is somewhere in the middle?\n\nETA: clarification in the last paragraph",

I was using a lip balm every night before bed, but one morning I woke up and my lips looked like two big, fat, garishly red caterpillars. I had allergy tests when I was a kid due to asthma and nothing except mold showed up so I never considered it, but it was around 20+ years prior. I stopped using the balm and thought maybe it was a bad batch or something. \n\nThen I had a couple lipsticks that did the same thing, I used them once or twice over a month or so. It was a cycle of them puffing up, then the next day they would be all crusty and shriveled, and the crusty would persist for at least a week while they healed up again. Like when they puffed up they would be very raw, then the next day it was almost like they scabbed over. \n\nSo I started thinking there must be a common denominator here. Lo and behold, it was lanolin. Every lanolin product inflames my lips. I have no problem wearing wool, it seems to be localized on my lips. \n\nI even went to the doctor about it and he said yes, it seems like an allergy but I would need to get tested to be sure. I declined because the closest allergist was over two hours away in another city with a one year wait and it wasn't life threatening or anything. It's easy enough to avoid in lip products, I have plenty of products with no lanolin. \n\nSo TLDR- I didn't have a problem with lanolin, until I did.",

I have discovered the incredible effects of CBG as an anti anxiety medicine and I really look for strains that have a decent CBG component - a few of the new Chemovar flowers have 2% CBG including this, and it’s awesome to see these other minor cannabanoids represented in Oz MC as we collectively increase our knowledge and appreciation of other minor cannabanoids such as CBG and CBN (a game changer for insomnia) 💚💚💚\n\nAs with all Chemovar flowers, this is incredibly terpy with 3.32% terps🔥\n\nDominant terps are nerolidol, beta caryophyllene, trans-nerolidol, limonene and linalool🤗\n\nIt’s a gorgeous combination of terps that has an intriguing and enjoyable  complex aroma. Opening the tub releases a delightful aroma that is fruity, floral, woody, candy and herbaceous 💚\n\nChemovar Facade is Apples and Bananas x Eye Candy. Apples and bananas has become a cult favorite in Oz MC, and this pheno hunt which has resulted in this cross is heavenly in terms of aroma, taste and effects 🍏 🍌 🍭 \n\nChemovar release lovingly grown craft cannabis. Hand trimmed and slow cured. They have absolutely nailed the recent releases - Bling Blaow, Facetz, Facade, Candy Pave and Triangle Chem.\n\nAs for all of the Chemovar  strains it’s fresh, loud, sticky, resinous, trichome laden goodness 😎 Chemovar delivers the sticky icky every time 🥰\n\nThe buds are a bright green with strong hints of purple, that are  covered in orange pistils, and frosty as!!!!! \n\nThe unique strain crosses, the freshness, and the unique terp profiles make all the new releases very refreshing in the Australian cannabis market. Chemovar only release very high quality medical cannabis, thank you Chemovar! 👏🙌🏼🫶🏽\n\nThe effects are uplifting and relaxing. Wonderful antidepressant effects - a very happy sensation with a weighted blanket feeling, suited to the evening slot for me. I love limonene for its antidepressant effects, and the linalool provides all the relaxation I need to wind down after a busy day 🧘‍♀️ \n\nAs an aside, for my fellow insomniacs - I  can’t recommend Triangle Chem more! I am always on the search for the best insomnia strains, this is it by far! For both sleep onset and to help you get back to sleep if you wake at night and struggle to get back to sleep. Miraculously I wake up perky and refreshed. Sourdough always made me groggy, cosmos went downhill, this is the key to unlock insomnia! I literally thank TC in the middle of the night for being so effective! This new batch hits really hard too, even harder than the first batch! 🥊 😴 \n\nI’m so grateful for the craft cannabis cannabis connoisseurs that bring us all the best cannabis products in Oz MC 👑\n\nFor me the trophies go to Chemovar, Single Estate and Canadian Craft Cannabis Company (superseed and mystery mountain) Broken Coast, and West Coast Palms are a very exciting new addition with their Hawaiian Rain and (soon coming!) new release of White Hot Guava 🤤 \n\nChemovar continue to disrupt the market with well priced craft cannabis. A craft cannabis 10g tub for $138 works for me! If you’re looking for stock or your pharmacy doesn’t stock Chemovar, give the incredible Gavin at Heathershaws ( Glen Iris, vic) a call. I’ve been with many Vic pharmacies (Astrid, Seutika, Medigreen) and from my personal experience Heathershaws by far are the friendliest and most accomodating, professional, compassionate team, and they really  go out of their way for their patients 🤗 \n\nThis year promises to be another very exciting year for Oz MC!!! 🥳💚\n\n\n",

Beautifully cured, fresh, resinous and sticky 🤤 \n\nThe aroma is very complex, dominated by notes of menthol with a strong cake undertone. In my TM2 I get lots of mint on the inhale, and cake and cream and a touch of pine on the exhale. Produces lots of vapour 💨 \n\nI haven’t had many mc oz strains that are creepers, this a certified creeper! The effects start off mild but then it quickly turns to a huge uplift of euphoria and joy, a lovely mental holiday. The effects continue to infuse me with anti depressant effects that are really long lasting. Like the joy of going up on a roller coaster, without going down! 😃 \n\nEventually the effects move into a very calm mind state, without being sedating. Others have said this is useful as a night strain, but I can happily use it during the day 😍\n\nRomulan 🌿\n\nSingle Estate Romulan is an indica dominant 26% THC strain which is a cross between white rhino x an unknown strain, with an impressive 3.78% terps. Dominant terps are \nfarnesene, pinene, humulene. \nGrower is Casa De Fiore 💪\n\nAnother gorgeous cure with sticky resinous squishy and sticky icky buds!🎉\n\nThe smell and taste are completely unique- skunky, candy, earthy, piney, with a hint of sour citrus. It’s really loud and  pungent, I could smell it before I opened it! 🍭 🌲 🍋‍🟩 \n\nInterestingly, this is another absolute creeper! So amazing to have two creeper strains on the market. The effects are blissful and calming and relaxing. It’s a gradual build that keeps elevating my mood and calming my mind and body. Very intense cerebral effects. It’s a super warm blanket for the mind body and soul 🧘‍♀️ \n\nSingle Estate has nailed their new jars! They are shorter and wider, allowing for all the big buds to avoid being squashed, and allowing me to see all the buds in their glory 🌿🌿🌿\n\nAnother set of incredible releases from Single Estate, who keep bringing out really unique strains with a passion and commitment to the highest quality cannabis, which is much appreciated by our medical cannabis community, I’m keen to see what’s on the horizon for Single Estate 👑 🏆🌿",

These are all available from my [shop](https://www.stoneandwit.com/) and from [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/StoneAndWit).\n\n# Revival Shoppe\n\n**Notes:**\n\nBergamot, coumarin, beeswax, oak moss\n\n**About:**\n\nInspired by the classic barbershop foug*è*res, this is a modernized vintage. The combination of ingredients gives a dry and clean texture with a beeswax sweet-earthiness vibe. THIS IS A VEGAN PRODUCT and does not contain beeswax.\n\n# Verity\n\n**Notes:**\n\nMint, cedar, ambergris accord\n\n**About:**\n\nInspired  by Verity Farseer, from Robin Hobb's Realm of the Elderlings books. Verity is abjectly devoted to the well-being of his country and  sacrifices himself in many ways to preserving the safety of the Duchies. He would much rather be a field commander than a King. The mint is  bright and refreshing while the cedar and ambergris accord combine to  make the \"ultimate sexy man smell\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Single Material Study Kit - Backbone Materials\n\nThis single material study kit contains some of the most widely used  ingredients in perfumery. The study kit comes in the same packaging as  the sample kits and also includes 10 scent testing strips.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Iso E Super**\n\n**Longevity:** Middle to base note\n\n**Profile:** Woody, ambergris\n\nOne of the  most important materials in modern perfumery. First discovered in 1973,  Iso E did not see mainstream usage until the late 1980s. Iso E is sort  of an enigmatic odor, containing facets of cedar, ambergris, patchouli,  vetiver, and an olfactive aura and texture that is uniquely its own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Galaxolide**\n\n**Longevity:** Base note\n\n**Profile:** Sweet, soft, clean\n\nGalaxolide  is a white musk. Galaxolide first saw widespread use in laundry  detergent and fabric softeners, hence the association with clean linen  and laundry. Galaxolide is a soft, sweet and almost neutral white musk.  It has nuances of florals and wood.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cetalox**\n\n**Longevity:** Base note\n\n**Profile:** Sweet, musky, ambergris, dry, woody\n\nCetalox is a relatively new synthetic ambergris material. First discovered in the 1930 as part of natural ambergris, Cetalox was not easily produced until the late 2010s, when a biotech process let production scale upwards. It  can be considered a cousin to Ambroxan but Cetalox is much softer and  sweeter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Hedione**\n\n**Longevity:** Middle note\n\n**Profile:** Transparent, jasmine, green, citrus, fruity\n\nHedione is  another material that has become of utmost importance in modern  perfumery. It’s usage grew in popularity starting in the late 1970s and  has become used in almost all perfumes since. Hedione (aka Methyl  dihydrojasmonate) occurs naturally in tea, jasmine, osmanthus, and  honey.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Linalool**\n\n**Longevity:** Top note\n\n**Profile:** Citrus, herbal, floral\n\nLinalool  is naturally found in everything from florals (jasmine, lavender) to  fruits and berries (blueberries, pomegranate, bergamot, lemon) to herbs  and spices (clove, oregano, black pepper, cannabis). On its own, linalool has facets of citrus and bergamot.",

And [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionLux/comments/102f0zu/i_spent_2k_on_skincare_so_you_dont_have_to/)'s a link to my last post, where I speak to some of the products that I skip mentioning here.\n\n**Product reviews**\n\n* **iS Clinical Active Serum 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is my HG exfoliant. It's the perfect strength for my skin. p50 was perfect before I started using retinoids (although I never tried the lower strengths), but this formula is the perfect formula to purify my oily T-zone while not causing irritation on dry-tending cheeks.\n   * *Cost:* $88 for 15mL\n   * *How I use it:* Either in the AM or PM, every other day (alternating with a retinoid). I use 5 drops on face and neck, applied with my hands on dry skin.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Lots of common suspects: glycerin, butylene glycol, alcohol denat., phenoxyethanol. None of these are terrible worth going into, although super sensitive folks may have trouble with the alcohol denat.\n      * Arbutin: skin-lightening ingredient that [works differently](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8632348/) than Vit C or licorice, so their effects can be complementary.\n      * Salix Alba (willow) bark extract: natural source of salicylic acid.\n      * Saccharum Officinarum Extract: natural source of glycolic acid.\n      * Bilberry extract: blueberry-like fruit with soothing and anti-aging properties. It's a [strong antioxidant](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-vaccinium-myrtillus-fruit-extract.html) due to the anthocyanins in the fruit (which give the skin its dark blue color).\n      * Polyporus Umbellatus Extract: source of kojic acid, which has skin brightening properties. It is also antimicrobial, according to the iS Clinical [website](https://isclinical.com/ingredient/view/index/id/5778).\n      * Menthol: this one is controversial. It's listed as an irritant, and I certainly don't want to dispute that. I also know that menthol is used in a wide variety of formulas (e.g., IcyHot), so I think it's worth trying and maybe backing off if you have trouble. \n* **Tata Harper Superkind Softening Cleanser 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* It feels like washing your face with floral honey, and it really does calm the skin. A 100% RP.\n   * *Cost:* $88 for 125mL\n   * *How I use it:* Everyday once (try to minimize since it's pricey). In the shower and rinse. Sometimes on dry skin.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * A powerful suite of emollients (which I'm OK with as an oily-combo skin type since it's a cream cleanser): evening primrose oil, apple seed oil, castor oil, jojoba seed oil, squalane, grape seed oil, and sunflower oil. Note these are all mid-low comedogenicity.\n      * Lactic acid serves as a very gentle exfoliant, although % is not listed.\n      * Olivem 1000, which is a combo of ingredients used to emulsify the formula. However, Olivem 1000 puts the products into a liquid crystal structure, which is supposed to absorb into the skin with increased efficacy. *To look for Olivem 1000 in a product, look for Sorbitan Olivate and Cetearyl Olivate.*\n      * Soothers in this formula are abundant (hence \"Superkind\"): prickly pear, calendula (#1 ingredient), and chamomile are the stars.\n      * Magnolia extract is another ingredient worth mentioning in this formula: it's a popular addition [for Nivea](https://www.nivea.com.au/advice/skin/magnolia-extract) as well. It has antioxidant, antimicrobial, and softening effects.\n      * There are a number of natural surfactants (it is a cleanser after all): decyl glucoside, and shea butter glycerides as the primary ones.\n      * As for all of Tata Harper's products (that I know of): there is fragrance. If you're super sensitive, proceed with caution.\n* **Tata Harper Regenerating Cleanser 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a physical/chemical exfoliant mix and is loaded with natural goodies in classic Tata fashion. It works well with the resurfacing mask, and is an effective formula for increased shine and deeper subsequent product penetration.\n   * *Cost:* $88 for 120mL\n   * *How I use it:* Twice a week, once with the resurfacing mask (see below for details).\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * This is a physical/chemical exfoliant mix: physical exfoliants include kaolin clay, apricot seed powder, and rice extract. These are quite small and I have found to be pleasant as a compounding abrasive agent. For chemical exfoliants, we have Salix Alba extract and pomegranate enzyme.\n      * Some more under the radar ingredients: Olivem 1000, radish root extract, superoxide dismutase, which is an effective antioxidant for protecting against reactive oxygen species (ROS). \n      * Aloe juice is near the top of the list and is soothing (as we know).\n      * Plenty of other good emollients in this formula as well (sunflower seed oil, olive oil). \n      * Lots of powerful fruit extracts in here, too (classic Tata): elderberry extract, alfalfa, and meadowsweet are the major ones. These are mostly antioxidant and antimicrobial actors in the formula.\n      * There are a few potential irritants in this formula, so maybe try the small size first to see if it agrees with your skin.\n* **Obagi Professional-C Serum 10% 5/5** There are only 5 ingredients in this formula, with AA as one of them. It's a good alternative for me vs. SC CE Ferulic since it's less comedogenic. It will oxidize quickly (as I've heard) so I usually keep this in the fridge. Retro-fitting a pump (vs. dropper) is a good idea, too. It smells good, too. It's $94 for 1oz. I use it after cleansing in the AM.\n* **EltaMD UV Clear Broad Spectrum SPF 46 5/5** Enough has been written about this brand and formula, so I'm not going to dive deep here. That said, it's physical/chemical and broad spectrum, has niacinamide, lactic acid, and is oil-free. It's a great option for sensitive, acne-prone skin. The tint was too obvious for my skin, so I prefer the clear version.\n* **Tata Harper Clarifying Moisturizer 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* If you have very oily skin, I would maybe avoid this formula. There are a number of somewhat comedogenic oils, but it may still be worth a try as comedogenicity is not always 1:1. It's a gorgeous formula and truly unique. My skin is oily-combo, and it works (and smells) like a charm. 100% RP.\n   * *Cost:* $130 for 1.7 fl oz.\n   * *How I use it:* I absolutely love this moisturizer. I use it everyday during my morning routine.\n   * *Ingredients:* Same idea as the mask. I can't speak to everything in this…you'd have to be a cosmetic botanist to do that…\n      * A number of interesting oils in this formula which tend to not be comedogenic: sandalwood oil, squalane, apple seed oil, evening primrose oil, sea buckthorn oil. Sandalwood oil is high in Ximenynic acid, [which is a potent anti-inflammatory agent](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/Detail/1777/556915/Pure-Australian-Sandalwood-Seed-Oil). Evening primrose has a lot of [antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects as well](https://www.byrdie.com/evening-primrose-oil-for-skin-5215964), although it falls in the middle of the comedogenicity rating. Sea Buckthorn oil is also an-\"it\" oil recently. It's also high in antioxidants incl. vit C., regulates sebum production, has antimicrobial properties, and obviously moisturizes ([source](https://www.byrdie.com/sea-buckthorn-oil-5210082)). Since this is a formula for blemish-prone skin, the formula is sebum-conscious. That said, if you have very oily skin, I would test before committing to the full bottle.\n      * Lots of soothing agents in here: Aloe, calendula, lactobacillus ferment, arnica, multiple types of HA, tremella extract (mushroom with outstanding humectant properties).\n      * The antioxidants in this formula are powerful (including the oils mentioned above): borage leaf extract, Tasmanian pepper extract, fermented bamboo, sea fern extract. \n      * As far as anti-acne agents, Zinc + Salix Alba bark extract are the main factors. \n      * There's also Alpha-Glucan oligosaccharide, which is [supposed to be](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/eu/PersonalCare/Detail/2510/74697/BioEcolia) beneficial for the skin microbiome.\n* **SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Gel:** **5/5**\n   * *Summary:* So this serum is a go-to for me as someone with combination skin that tends toward redness. A 100% RP. 5/5.\n   * *Cost:* $78 for 30mL\n   * *How I use it:* The serum is something I put up to augment any active I use, and I love it for that reason. It’s hydrating, calming, and smells good, and it ultimately is the most frequently used product in my routine. \n   * *Ingredients:* There are a number of interesting ingredients in this formula: \n      * Olea Europaea Leaf Extract is olive leaf extract, and it’s shown some promise in [this](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32333467/) study (although it’s a small group, not double blind or randomized, and technically doesn’t meet statistical significance thresholds). That said, PC has [great things to say](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredients/ingredient-olea-europaea-leaf-extract.html). Major benefits are improvement in skin texture, some photoprotection, and antioxidant properties (high in catechin and rutin, both bioflavonoids). \n      * There’s also cucumber fruit extract, which has moisturizing (no surprise, it’s 95% water), antioxidant (some Ascorbic Acid, some flavonoids), and conditioning properties. Cucumber is one of the rare instances of a non-sensitizing fragrance. \n      * This formula also has grapefruit extract and thyme extract — consensus from outside SkinCeuticals seems light to mid on both of these. \n      * The formula has a small amount of Morus Bombycis Root Extract, which is derived from mulberry and has arbutin in it, which as we know is good for skin lightening as it’s a hydroquinone derivative. \n      * There are a few icks in this formula (fragrance, linalool, etc.), but overall I have found it to be very calming and pleasant. \n* **Dr. Jart+ Cicapair Tiger Grass Sleepair Intensive Mask 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a thick, non-comedogenic formula with intense soothing effects. It will likely pill, but it's intended for night use, so that shouldn't be an issue. I prefer this to the SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Masque. Will RP.\n   * *Cost:* $42 for 110mL\n   * *How I use it:* I only use this for irritated skin, which it promptly resolves over night.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * As far as moisturizing factors, this product has over ten humectants: propanediol, glycerin, trehalose being the highest on the ingredient list\n      * There are a smaller number of emollients: only true oil being moringa seed oil, which is far down the ingredient list. Point being: *this product is thick but has not been comedogenic in my experience.*\n      * The real power of this product is in the soothing ingredients it offers: gotu kola (cica) being the featured #1. Gotu Kola contains a number of active compounds, including madecassoside, which has been shown to work as a [wound-healing agent](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18503551/), an [anti-hyperpigmentation agent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6290557/), and a soothing ingredient [potentially effective](https://www.seppic.com/en/clean-moisture-lotion-as40140a) for atopic dermatitis (eczema). There are more soothing agents in this formula—without listing them all, suffice it say that Dr. Jart+'s chemists know what they're doing.\n      * There is also Niacinamide, Curcumin extract, Adenosine, Cacao seed extract, and other antioxidant ingredients for a nourishing blend.\n* **CeraVe SA Cream for Rough and Bumpy Skin 5/5** \n   * Summary: It's a standard (not lux) product which is effective for KP. It works.\n   * Cost:\n   * How I use it: I use it on the body (esp. on the thighs). 2x/day.\n   * Ingredients:\n      * It's a thick formula (lots of ceramides, corn oil, paraffin, mineral oil, cholesterol), but it's interestingly not comedogenic (also because it's indicated for body use vs. face). \n      * In terms of actives, we have lactate, vit E, salicylic acid, niacinamide, and phytosphingosine.\n* **SkinMedica TNS Advanced+ Serum 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* A multi-tasking superformula with growth factors derived from human fibroblasts. It's very expensive, and it's something that I don't think I will repurchase (not because it doesn't work) but because anti-aging isn't my #1 priority. While my skin is young, I'm focused on anti-acne and hyperpigmentation, but for folks who want to improve collagen and elastin production, this is it.\n   * *Cost:* $295 for 1oz.\n   * *How I use it:* After microneedling at home, once or twice a week. \n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * TNS (total nutrient system): this is a medium that is harvested from propagated human fibroblasts. This medium is rich in nutrients and signaling compounds that trigger collagen and elastin production.\n      * Lots of other goodies: peptide complexes such as whey, lactococcus ferment, algae extract, usual suspects for humectants, fruit extracts such as apple and grape, pullulan, lecithin (for creating liposomes which deliver actives deeper into the skin).\n* **SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel: 5/5 — with caution**\n   * *Summary:* This is a strong cleanser and should only be used for folks with oily skin. It has a cooling effect, which is pleasant, but the combination of actives in this is no joke. If you have really congested, clogged pores, I would recommend it. It's cheap enough, and strong enough, that I only need a bit and can use it as a semi-regular purge. It's an RP for me.\n   * *Cost:* $42 for 240mL\n   * *How I use it:* I usually only use it in my T-zone, leave it on for no more than 3 minutes and rinse.\n   * *Ingredients:* \n      * Sodium Laureth Sulfate: Chief Bubble Officer. [Less irritating](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12641575/) than Sodium *Lauryl* Sulfate.\n      * Glycolic acid: most researched and effective AHA. We know this sloughs off the top layer of dead skin cells. \n      * Salicylic acid (SA): an HG for acne treatment. Is lipid soluble so it can penetrate more deeply into the sebaceous gland and provide a better decongesting effect. This is in addition to exfoliating properties acting at the skin surface (although inferior to glycolic in that respect).\n      * Capryolyl Salicylic acid (LHA): this is a compound developed by L'Oreal to be a more lipophilic version of SA, providing better penetration. The study is from 2007 and 100% sponsored by L'Oreal but you can read it [here](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(06)03022-2/fulltext) if you're interested. There is some hubbub about pregnancy safety; do your own research on that front if that's applicable to you.\n      * Menthol: provides a nice cooling but can be sensitizing. [PC](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-menthol.html) is pretty adamant against it, but I don't really give it too much stead. They cite pretty old research. I don't think my skin has been sensitized from it. There is [some newer evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8620938/) of it promoting wound healing.\n      * [Sorbitol](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-sorbitol.html): A sugar substitute that acts as a humectant. Interestingly, it can also act as a prebiotic. Certain bacteria on your skin can convert sorbitol into beta-glucan, which calms the skin. Beta-glucan is partially responsible for the calming effect of oats and seaweed\n* **PCA Clearskin Lightweight Moisturizer:** **4/5**\n   * *Summary:* Overall, I find this product to be hydrating and non-offensive. To be honest, I don't know that it surpasses my OG in this category (non-comedogenic moisturizer) which is Neutrogena HydroBoost Water Gel. Although, if you need something more emollient than that, this is a very good option.\n   * *Cost:* $57 for 1.7oz\n   * *How I use it:* This is a good option for night time for those with oily skin. It might be too thick to put under an occlusive sunscreen during the day esp. if you run oily. Otherwise, daytime fine, too.\n   * *Ingredients:* \n      * Ethylhexyl Isononanoate (say that 5 times fast) is the primary emollient here, and to be honest I can’t find much in the way of research on this compound. That said, I really trust PCA because your ingredients must really be top notch if you’re going to have the most bland packaging known to man. Murad and EltaMD also seem to be fans of it, which is a good sign. There are a number of other emollients, preservatives, and viscosity controlling agents which are probably not worth mentioning (they're pretty inert as far as those go). \n      * Borage seed oil has a comedogenicity rating of 2 (out of 5, 5 being instant pimple) and is very high in GLA (gamma linolenic acid) which [PC](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-gamma-linolenic-acid-gla.html) considers to be a \"best\" rating. There is some good consensus that it has skin regulating properties (eczema, seborrheic dermatitis, etc.). \n      * Other calming ingredients: aloe, calendula, cucumber, chamomile (bisabolol). Has glycerin as well (although not too much). \n      * There is retinyl palmitate, which is a bit confusing to me, to be honest. If you're making a moisturizer for oily skin, I don't know why you would include one of the least active forms of vitamin A. \n* **SkinMedica HA5 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* I think this is probably a miracle product if you have deep wrinkles. The five different types of HA are going to sit on various levels of the dermis, provide different hydration profiles, and sustain moisture in different ways. For me, as a younger person without deep wrinkles, it's nice but not worth the $ for me right now.\n   * *Cost:* $184 for 2oz\n   * *How I use it:* Usually replaces a proper (?) moisturizer during daytime for me and put sunscreen on over.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * 5 types of HA. I'm not going to go through them, but there is crosslinked (bigger HA, which sits on top of skin cuz there's no way it's penetrating any deeper), hydrolyzed (smaller version but SkinMedica doesn't give the weight so hard to say exactly where it's going to land in the skin), plus the regular HA. I actually see 3 obvious HAs in the ingredients, not 5. Someone help.\n      * Texturizing compounds (HDI/Trimethylol Hexyllactone Cross-p, polymethylsilsesquioxane) which give it a really nice slip feel\n      * Pullulan (mentioned this [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionLux/comments/102f0zu/i_spent_2k_on_skincare_so_you_dont_have_to/)) but this is the compound that tightens the skin and is used to create the Listerine sheets.\n      * Vitis Vinifera Seed Extract (grape seed), which [PC loves](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-vitis-vinifera-grape-seed-extract.html). It's antioxidant containing and many of them at that (resveratrol, anthocyanins, flavonoids, etc.)\n      * Vibrio alginolyticus ferment filtrate: This is actually a pathogenic Gram-negative bacterium, but this is obviously not a live form of it. Hard to find a lot of info on it, but[ it seems like](https://trulux.com.au/products/vibrio-alginolyticus-ferment-filtrate#:~:text=Vibrio%20Alginolyticus%20Ferment%20Filtrate)%20organizes,exopolysaccharide%20synthesized%20by%20kopara%20microorganisms.) it claims to be helpful in epidermal organization. \n      * Porphyridium cruentum extract which is a red algae derivative that has zeaxanthin, which is in the vitamin A family and has photoprotective properties. Jury seems to be out on efficacy.\n      * Moisturizing factors: Serine, Urea, Trehalose. Urea is interesting because it does have a function in rejuvenation (by breaking down a protein called filaggrin which helps organize the keratin in the skin at the top layer). This is thought to free up amino acids in the ECM.\n      * Skin communication ingredients: Whey protein, Plankton extract\n* **Tata Harper Repairative Moisturizer 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* It's not for me since my skin is oily, but it's a fab product if you're OK with emollients and fragrance (very well harvested and preserved via pump).\n   * *Cost:* \n   * *How I use it:* Since my skin is oily/combo, I don't often use this to be honest. This would be perfect for daily use for dry skin types or those that can get away with a product that gives some more shine.\n   * *Ingredients:* Simply too many to list. Check them out [here](https://incidecoder.com/products/tata-harper-repairative-moisturiser). \n* **SkinMedica TNS Ceramide Treatment Cream: 4/5** Also not going to go super in depth here. TNS is the same as mentioned above, but this formula is a lot cheaper and has a much more emollient feel. I only use it post-procedure. Will RP when I have another procedure (esp. microneedling or Morpheus).\n* **SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic: 4/5** Not going to say a whole lot here. But I did figure out that the Vit E in this way causing some closed comedones, so I had to stop using it on the face. Won't be RP for that reason.\n* **First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream: 4/5** Want to revise the record and say that I do believe this broke me out a few times on the face. Great for dry areas on the body, eczema, or post-procedure. Not great for face if oily.\n* **SkinCeuticals AGE Eye Complex:** **4/5 since I am 26 and advanced glycation end products probably not a huge issue for me**\n   * *Summary:* I wrote a review of this in my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionLux/comments/102f0zu/i_spent_2k_on_skincare_so_you_dont_have_to/), and I don’t think much has changed, although I do think that I can effectively minimize any irritation from this product with applying a small amount. I’ve taken a deeper dive into some of the ingredients. \n   * *How I use it:* Just a little bit below the eyes in the morning\n   * *Cost:* $105 for 15mL\n   * *Ingredients:* \n      * First off, like 7/10 first ingredients are about viscosity and skin-feel and that definitely comes through when you apply the product. It’s hard in the jar but slips on the face very nicely. This is also good for ensuring it lasts a long time. \n      * There are also a number of compounds that scatter light such as Nylon-12, reducing the appearance of fine lines. \n      * It also obviously features Pro-Xylane (thanks L’Oreal). I tried to find some independent research on this (and [this](https://www.wcd2019milan-dl.org/abstract-book/documents/late-breaking-abstracts/45-wound-healing/proxylane-a-plant-sugar-derivative-9.pdf) is the closest I could find). Basically L’Oreal claims that it helps restore the ECM (extracellular matrix, which is where collagen, elastin, and many of the other things responsible for skin appearance lie). \n      * We also have Ascorbyl Glucoside (AG) in this formula, which makes sense regarding skin firmness and lightening. Jury is still out on in-vivo skin penetration of AG but it does create a reservoir of Vit C in the skin because it takes time for it to be converted into ascorbic acid (AA). \n      * There is caffeine in this formula as well, which we know is an antioxidant and helps with circulation.\n      * There is some UV protection from titanium dioxide. \n      * There’s also Hesperdin Methyl Chalcone which is derived from citrus and has blood vessel protecting properties. It’s at minimum an antioxidant and at maximum can help reduce dark circles due to its effect on vasculature. \n      * There’s anthocyanins in the form of bilberry extract but it’s far down on the ingredients so who knows how impactful that is. \n      * There are also a number of peptides in this formula which should help contribute to a firming effect. \n* **Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a cult favorite from an iconic brand in the Green Beauty space. \n   * *Cost:* $68 for 1oz.\n   * *How I use it:* I use this once a week with the Regenerating Cleanser ([as Tata suggests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfrVxpoG_Nw)), which I use on dry skin and then layer with this mask. Leave on for 5 minutes, rinse, and my face feels great.\n   * *Ingredients:* If I had to write a complete summary of ingredients for all of her products, we'd be here all day & I would hit the word limit. So I'm going for an abridged approach.\n      * The primary active in this product is Salix Alba Bark Extract (willow bark) which is a natural BHA source. \n      * Despite being a resurfacing mask, there are a number of effective soothing complexes in this formula, namely 2 types of aloe. You could argue that Beet Root is a soother as well, although it's primarily a source of antioxidants and functions as a humectant.\n      * There is lactobacillus ferment, which Estee Lauder introduced in 2009 as a DNA repair enzyme and an antioxidant. There's also pomegranate enzyme which is extract using lactobacillus, although this functions more as an exfoliant.\n      * Radish Root Extract, which you'll find in Dr. Barbara Strum products + some (all?) versions of p50. This works both as a preservative in the formula but also as an antimicrobial on the skin.\n      * Kaolin clay — a gentler alternative to Bentonite which work as a mild abrasive and oil-wicking agent.\n      * Note there are a number of irritants in this product, so if you're sensitive to fragrance, be cautious.\n* **Maya Chia The Straight A Gentle Retinol Treatment 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* I used this for 2 weeks. For the first week, my skin had a glow like no other. For the second week, I broke out. It's comedogenic for folks with more oily-type skin.\n   * *Cost:* $125 for 30mL\n   * *How I use it:* At night, after cleansing and a serum (optional).\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Lots of strong emollients which are plant derived and serve double duty as antioxidants as well: Chia seed oil, Rose hip oil, Raspberry seed oil, Buriti oil, Sunflower seed oil, Vitamin E\n      * Encapsulated retinol optimizes the retinol delivery system into the skin, and keeps it fresh for longer\n      * Natural retinol alternatives: Moth bean extract and bakuchiol which promote cell turnover (retinol's main mechanism of action)\n      * Tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate (THDA) is a form of vit C which has [shown promise](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrahexyldecyl-ascorbate) but is less proven than straight up AA. \n* **Neocutis Lumiere Firm Eye Cream 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* I really like this eye cream and I might RP. I love the pump, and I love the packaging. It does make a difference and my sensitive eyes tolerate it well. I wonder if it has been slightly too thick for my oily skin even though the eyes and cheeks run drier.\n   * *Cost:* $108 for 15mL\n   * *How I use it:* In eye area (not above) once a day, very small amount gently rubbed in\n   * *Ingredients:* Not going to go into too much detail here: it has caffeine, vit C (as THDA, AA, and ascorbyl palmitate), beech tree bud extract, lecithin, HA, licorice extract for brightening, peptides, growth factors, and chamomile. It's a multi-pronged formula with a lot of promise and gentle but effective actives.\n* **Consonant Hydrextreme 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is an excellent humectant product. It's very simple. I will not be RPing at this time because it's a bit too simple for me + feels like it doesn't go as far as some of the other options in this space.\n   * *Cost:* $112 for 30mL\n   * *How I use it:* After actives, before moisturizer, with wet hands.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Glycerin: it's probably the least offensive and most popular humectant. You probably already know it :). This is a high concentration formula that is not tacky or sticky.\n      * Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide: this is a plant sugar with emollient properties and is a good source of antioxidants ([source](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-cassia-angustifolia-seed-polysaccharide.html)).\n* **Aveeno Tone and Texture Renewing Night Cream 3/5**\n   * *Summary:* It's a good product. The PHA exfoliant is not quite strong enough for my KP so I will not be RPing, but it's a good choice if you have more sensitive skin on the body.\n   * *Cost:* $10 for 8oz on Amazon\n   * *How I use it:* On the body, roughly twice a week.\n   * *Ingredients:* I love the way that Aveeno breaks down the ingredients so see [here](https://www.aveeno.com/products/tone-texture-gentle-renewing-night-cream) if you're curious.\n* **Tata Harper Body Revitalizing Oil 3/5** Not going to do a deep dive here. The ingredients are quality, but it's too small of an amount for the price (considering that it goes on the body so you need much more).\n* **Tata Harper Resurfacing Body Serum 3/5** Same thing here. It's a fabulous formula but it's way too expensive for how much you'd need to use on the body. The bottle might give you 15 uses on the full body, which is just hard to justify.\n* **SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Masque: 3/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a calming masque and SC claims it decreases your skin surface temperature by something like 5 degrees (ok). It's been sitting almost full in my cabinet for a while — it's nice but won't RP unless it's for post-procedure for something majorly irritating (phenol peel?).\n   * *Cost:* $66 for 60mL\n   * *How I use it:* Almost never lol. Would be great for post procedure.\n   * *Ingredients:* There is not a whole lot of extra detail to add here as compared with the gel described above. There are a few additional ingredients that are worth mentioning: Acetyl Dipeptide-1 Cetyl Ester is a dipeptide that has skin calming and fibroblast protecting properties (PC agrees but [here's](https://www.activepeptide.com/product/acetyl-dipeptide-1-cetyl-ester/) the link to buy it raw if you want to experiment yourself yikes).\n* **SkinMedica AHA/BHA Cream 2/5**\n   * *Summary:* It is confused about what it is and who it's for. I don't understand why there's so much more bilberry extract than exfoliants. I understand that these can be irritating products, but it feels like SM is putting the cart before the horse here. It should exfoliate first and foremost, and for me, it doesn't. No RP.\n   * *Cost:* $48 for 2oz\n   * *How I use it:* Almost never. It's probably fine to use morning and night, but depends on your face + wear SPF always but esp. in the AM if using AHAs.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Lots of Bilberry extract (2nd ingredient)\n      * Moisturizing/calming: Aloe, Glycerin, Squalane, Chamomile (2 types), B5\n      * Natural AHAs: Sugar Cane Extract, Orange Fruit Extract, Lemon Extract. To me, these are not astringent enough to be effective. Perhaps it's the rest of the moisturizer and emollience of the rest of the formula, but I just don't feel that this sloughs off the dead skin in the way that I want it to.\n      * There's also BHA (Salicylic acid), Vit E, and Vit C (as ascorbyl palmitate). Like I said — confused.\n* **Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay 2/5** Not going to go in depth here. I don't think I'll ever \\*have\\* to RP (since it's huge), but I don't think I would. It's very good for removing sebaceous filaments and pulling oil from the skin. It's a bit strong, but it's a good option if you struggle with oil control.\n* **Avene Eau Thermale 2/5**\n   * *Summary:* It's just water. \n   * *Cost:* $20\n   * *How I use it:* On my face\n   * *Ingredients:* Mineral water. Be careful — it's pH 7.5. If you put this on immediately after any actives that require a narrow pH range (e.g., AA, AHAs/BHAs), you are going to inactivate them. \n* **Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask: 1/5** Not going to go in depth here. Will not RP. It works but so does Aquaphor.\n* **Darphin Intral Inner Youth Serum 1/5**\n   * *Summary:* No change noticed during 2 months of use. Fragrance is a bit sickly-sweet. Will not RP.\n   * *Cost:* $50 for 15mL\n   * *How I use it:* At night after an irritating product (retinoid or exfoliant).\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Chief function of the serum is soothing: it has panthenol, chamomile, and Alteromonas ferment (which is used across the cosmetics industry as a soothing agent).\n      * There is moisturizing action here, too: glycerin, glycosaminoglycans, castor oil (low comedogenicity). This is obvious from the serum nature of the formula, but it's certain not a moisturizer in and of itself.\n      * Peony extract is one of the chief ingredients and scents. Cannot find anything about the benefits of this.\n\nIn the queue next for me: is Clinical Cleansing Complex, Herbivore's Nova and Bakuchiol, Chebula Serum by True Botanicals, SkinCeuticals Retexturing Activator, Glytone Brightening Cleansing Powder, and UltraCeuticals Vitamin A serum, Vivier V-Stat Scar Gel — any experiences or thoughts are welcome!!",

Many users report anti-anxiety effects with limonene, while others may have an opposite effect from the 'energetic' feeling.\n\nPinene (a-Pinene and b-Pinene): Pine needle scent/flavor. Effects include increased focus and memory recall with \"clear-headed\" cerebral highs.  Useful for tasks requiring attention to detail.  a-Pinene and b-Pinene are THC receptor inhibitors which may decrease THC activity, which may lead to some users reporting increased energy, and also may lead to some users experiencing a briefer or an extended high.\n\nTerpinolene: Citrus/pine needle scent, similar to turpentine (or Pine-Sol).  Effects include reduced anxiety, pain relief, and \"hazy\" head highs.  Terpinolene is common in classic sativa strains such as Jack Herer and Durban Poison, though many users report decreased energy and lack of focus from terpinolene's sedative activity, while others report increased energy and euphoria (this may be from anxiety relief while still feeling as primarily a head high).\n\nb-Caryophyllene: Scent and flavor vary depending on paired terpenes and flavonoids; common scent/flavors include gasoline, rubber-tire, black-pepper.  Effects include reduced anxiety along with reduced inflammation and possible pain relief, with a combination of body and head highs.  Useful for relaxation and stress relief.  b-Caryophyllene is the only terpene with the ability to activate CB2 receptors in the body to trigger an anti-inflammation response.\n\nLinalool: Lavender or floral scent/flavor, commonly contributing to 'skunk' or 'sour' scent and flavors.  Effects include reduced anxiety and euphoria, with a combination of body and head highs.  Useful for relaxation and stress relief.  Linalool users commonly report relaxing effects without the 'sedating or sleepy' effects that can be coupled with high levels of Myrcene.\n\nb-Myrcene: Scent and flavor vary depending on paired terpenes and flavonoids; common scent/flavors include mango, fruit, soil.  Effects include sedation, reduced inflammation and possible pain relief, with strong body highs.  Useful for stress relief and as a sleep aid.  Many users report decreased anxiety with high levels of Myrcene, while others may report increased anxiety from an unexpected increase in THC activity (read below).\n\n\\*\\*\\*Myrcene is very complicated, in that it decreases the permeability of the blood-brain barrier, essentially allowing compounds to enter the brain more effectively.  This increases the effectiveness of THC (and other terpenes) to enter the brain and activate receptors, basically allowing Myrcene to strengthen other effects of a strain.\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHey all.

Basically, if your label says 3% terpenes, but only lists 10mg/g Limonene + 5mg/g Myrcene + 5 mg/g Linalool, there are another 10mg/g of other combined terpenes present apart from the most abudant 3 terpenes listed.\n\n\\*(If you're good with math, remember that 1% of 1000mg = 10mg/g)\\*",

    "body": "(Warning: Very long, but well organized.)\n\n**The bottom line: most of the physical changes brought on by HRT cannot be initiated by herbs alone.** However, herbs hold promise in a number of specific areas. First is that many are good at causing a few of the specific physical changes associated with HRT such as superficial facial fat redistribution and softening of the skin; I review an herb that is promising for hair growth. Second is that many can bring on positive mental effects that a number of trans people say are helpful to them, and some trans people report that herbs can give them a ‘taste’ of what estrogen is like as they decide if HRT is right for them. \n\n**Potential Advantages of Herbal Estrogenics**\n\nFirst, herbal treatments can be used in conjunction with prescription treatments to help transwomen reach specific gender goals. For example, if a trans person has only a partial response to their treatments (which can be caused by many things, such as [a genetically-heritable insensitivity of the estrogenic receptors which in such cases do not activate even in the presence of increasing blood levels](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/102/1/93/2804767?login=true), an herbal approach might help fill in gaps and facilitate changes in appearance and mood. That is, herbs could have an additive (‘adjunctive’) effect, potentially increasing the speed of certain changes or reducing side effects without doing much on their own. (See the last section for a discussion of whether/to what extent herbs may interact with prescription hormones.)\n\nSecond, herbal treatments could be used by ‘trans curious’ people who want to start experiencing changes but feel the pharmaceutical treatments would have too strong an effect for them. I would include in this group individuals who do not want some of the long-term effects of HRT (such as changes in the size and function of the genitals) while still desiring some degree of feminization. I have talked to a trans person who used Pueraria Mirifica alone because they did not want any changes to their genital function. \n\nLastly, some transgender women use herbs for ‘natural breast enhancement’, but I do not recommend this at all unless it is done with utmost care and only in conjunction with prescription treatments. I review 'natural breast enhancement' and talk about its pitfalls in a later section.\n\n**Most Promising Therapeutics**\n\n**Pueraria Mirifica (PM)** I consider to be the herb with the most potential for those on feminizing HRT. I first saw this recommended multiple times by trans people who said the following things: first, that it caused some slight physical changes (primarily skin changes, but even breast growth when it was taken in combination with other herbs). But these physical changes did not rival what can be achieved by pure estrogen. Its main advantage seems to be in terms of mental changes. I read a few trans people who claimed that PM helped them feel a calm that they said helped them feel ready to transition, and that helped them ‘test’ what taking estrogen might be like before considering use of the pharmaceuticals. \n\nPM seems to contain stronger estrogenic than any other plant I’ve read about. Interestingly, it seems to contain a mix of many of the same estrogenic found in other plants, but also some unique and powerful ones. Like soy it contains some estrogens that are isoflavones, which are quite weak plant-based estrogens but that seem to have lots of health effects. It contains [genistein, the chief isoflavone in soy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0731708506004626); it also contains [a number of other classes of plant-based estrogens such as coumarins](https://academic.oup.com/chromsci/article/55/3/214/2937908). What is most significant is that, in addition to essentially acting like a ‘super soy’ with all the strongest components of soy, it contains an estrogenic only found in this plant, ‘deoxymiroestrol', which is said to have very strong actions at the estrogen receptor – [at times close to or comparable to those of estrogen itself, according to this study which looked at its binding affinity to estrogen receptors.](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/np990547v)\n\nMirifica extract appears quite safe compared to many other hormonal herbs, with the most common side effect being nausea from overindulgence in it; further, it is used all over the medical system of Thailand as a ‘rejuvenating’ treatment and so has established itself as being reliable. The easiest route is to take 500mg of an oral extract (I recommend the brand Ainterol) and eventually increase to twice a day. A trans friend of mine, however, takes 3000mg. Other routes are possible: it could be made into a cream or spray. I have seen it recommended that trans individuals in addition to taking some of it orally can apply some spray of it 2-3 times daily to the breast and butt to potentially encourage feminization of those areas. While it is a documented ‘side effect’ that the herb alone when taken by men can make them grow breasts, I don’t think this is a very typical result that trans people can expect from using PM alone. I have seen people get results in the use of PM to grow breasts, but only when it was used with a few herbal anti-androgens which I consider to be of questionable safety (see the last section on the dangers of ‘natural breast enhancement’). \n\nPM need not be taken daily and it need not be taken long-term, although I don’t think it would be very unsafe to do so in most cases. Some trans people may prefer to use it for a time until they can see results from it and then phase it out. One can read stories of many using mirifica on the ‘natural breast enhancement’ forum Breast Nexus. What is generally reported from growth with mirifica is that, unfortunately, in genetic women much of it does revert when it is stopped along with the herbs that are typically taken along with it. However, I do think it is possible that if mirifica does cause changes at strategic times during the transition, these might be lasting due to the strength of the pharmaceuticals taken with it. One could imagine, for example, taking mirifica only in the first few months of a transition, or only before one begins pharmaceutical treatments. I do not think it is likely to interact negatively with prescription HRT drugs. While some phytoestrogens seem to compete with estrogen and block it, PM does not seem to be likely to do that as, besides the strong and powerful deoxymiroestrol, most of the estrogenic effects are isoflavone based meaning they are mild and mostly work in the background.\n\n**Mint** acts as [a mild anti-androgen according to clinical studies](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ptr.2900?casa_token=mJIY3VfTbhAAAAAA:wRxTzjJ-c-0yRsUjs956vA2XVPCO1m4SlGjgp7vHT_PaCMXRY_W4F1sGix6P170bx91la3gRB8fSHuh9), and I’ve seen many positive reports from trans people about it. It seems to quite reliably soften the skin when taken as a tea. Further, many report anxiety-reduction from the regular use of it. This would likely be in addition to its digestion-promoting properties, which it has been used for over thousands of years. Mint is likely safe and healthy when taken as a tea, but it can be overdone, as the chief constituent – menthol – can be irritating in high doses (everyone who has ever used mouth wash knows this). I recommend using spearmint over peppermint when making the tea since spearmint has a lower menthol content; if you wanted some peppermint taste, you could try making the tea with 2/3rds spearmint and 1/3rd peppermint.\nHowever, while high-menthol preparations of mint aren’t safe internally, they can be applied directly to the skin which can help you experience the skin-softening effects of mint. I recommended medicated soaps and lotions made with strong quantities of mint, of which I think the finest are those soaps and lotions made by the company Dr. Bronners. \n\n**Bhringraj** is an estrogenic herb in India that is known as ‘food for the hair’. It is infused into a body oil and used as a hair growth treatment, to prevent or reverse balding as well as to make hair  grow faster and shinier. It contains a number of [coumarin estrogenics as well as some alkaloids unique to the plant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4897414/). Its ability to grow hair is attested to not only by thousands of years of medical practice in India but also by science, as in a study of the rat it [performed well in a head-to-head with minoxidil.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18478241/)\n\nThough properly made Bhringraj oil cannot easily be obtained in the United States, it is easy enough to make. I made some according to [this recipe](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2013/03/25/how-to-make-bhringraj-oil-for-hair-growth-video/), but leaving out the other herbs and milk and merely using 2.5x the bhringraj called for in the recipe along with the base oil. I tested it out on my hair (which was very short at the time), leaving it in overnight before washing it out (yes it was very greasy). I cannot deny that it worked because I noticed something very strange with my hair the next few days: I began having new hairs sprout in many new directions, which looked strange and very noticeable with my short hair. I do admit it looked disheveled for a while, but if I had continued the treatment I believe the new sprouting hairs would’ve been strong enough and vibrant enough to look nice. \n\n**Soy** alone is very unlikely to cause any kind of feminization. But, it is still a good idea for trans women to take soy given its well-proven positive effects for women’s endocrine health. We simply do not need another study to show [the considerable anti-cancer effects of regular use of soy](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/acamc/2013/00000013/00000008/art00005); it has been established clearly enough.\n\nSoy contains isoflavones in the same way that PM does, and it even contains some of the same ones – both soy and PM contain ‘[genistein](https://academic.oup.com/carcin/article/17/2/271/269781?login=true)’, which is perhaps the most well-studied phytoestrogen. Both are genetically related and found in the legume family. Unlike PM, however, soy does not contain some of the more potent estrogenics found in PM which explains its much weaker effects. \n\nI highly recommend whole-plant soy over any kind of bottled extract. One simply will not get the full range of isoflavones using an extract, and there are sometimes benefits to some of the constituents in plants that are only found in small concentrations in it. So, I’d recommend the addition of whole soy to the diet a few times a week. Again it won’t cause immediate or noticeable changes, unless you consider a slight increase in healthiness a noticeable change. \n\n**The challenges of herbal anti-androgens: Why ‘natural breast enhancement’ is suspect**\n\nThere is no doubt that herbal breast growth ‘works’ for trans people in the sense that there are in fact combinations of herbs which can be taken and can semi-reliably cause breast growth. Such things are attested to by enough evidence, and I already mentioned breast nexus as once such place where one can find accounts and timeline evidence. But the concern with ‘natural breast enhancement’ (NBE) is that the herbs needed to make it work tend to be toxic. While the herbs I discussed earlier in this review are those that I think can make good consistent medicines, people who do NBE use herbs known to be more dangerous when taken long-term. One common example of an NBE regimen used by some trans women is the combination of mirifica, fenugreek and saw palmetto. Saw palmetto works a bit like Finasteride in [stopping the conversion of testosterone to DHT](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2840915/), however it carries effects some trans individuals do not want such as [an increase in test levels, and potentially a decrease in estrogen levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2525623/); Further, many studies show it to be unreliable in doing things like reducing prostate problems. It thus hardly counts as an anti-androgen in any concrete sense. Fenugreek is taken to increase progestin levels, but it also [might act as an aromatase inhibitor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6191980/) and so, again, may increase testosterone levels. Further, fenugreek seems to exert downright [toxic effects on the reproductive system when used long term, negatively impacting not just test but estrogen too](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27498339/). Neither of these things should ever be used for more than a few weeks; they cannot be part of a long-term treatment plan.\n\nAnd so, most ‘NBE’ stacks do ‘work’ to grow breasts at the cost of being generally unhealthy and causing a lot of unwanted effects. Further, they may not cause feminization of any other parts of the body, and this can in my opinion create a kind of ‘unnatural’ look where the breasts don’t seem to fit the body and which makes it look like one has gotten implants installed even though they were grown 'naturally'. \n\nAnd so the number one issue with feminizing herbs is that it is very very difficult to take any herb that can reliably suppress testosterone and yet lack significant side effects. Simply put, there doesn’t really ‘exist’ a simple, effective herbal anti-androgen. Peppermint is about the closest one can get, but its effects – while apparent in the skin – aren’t likely to be enough to initiate breast growth on its own even with herbal estrogenics. One reason herbal estrogenics simply don’t do much in the body of a trans person is that, unlike endogenous estradiol, they simply aren’t present in high enough concentrations to really suppress T. One option in the use of herbals might be to combine them with a low-to-medium dose of something like bica, a pharmaceutical anti-androgen. Of course, this defeats the purpose for some who seek the herbal approach precisely to avoid the long-term changes brought on by pharmaceutical treatments. \n\nI am still exploring whether there are any reliable herbal anti-androgens. Neem is a strong anti-androgen but it is also an anti-estrogen. The best herbal anti-androgen I have seen so far seems to be licorice. Licorice reduces serum test levels in men: this study found that [the average in respondents went from 740+/-216 to 484+/-181 after only a week of a strong licorice extract.](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJM199910073411515?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed) A [similar anti-androgenic result](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15579328/) was obtained in women. Unlike Fenugreek, licorice seems to have less of a risk of long-term side effects, although I have yet to review the safety studies. Further, some say that white peony roots are an aromatase promoter and reduce testosterone levels, though I have not yet reviewed those studies yet. Ultimately, while you can find positive results for both these substances, it is merely a theoretical guess as to whether they can realistically suppress T enough to allow a trans person to transition from herbs alone. If it would safe, one would probably want to extract the main chemical principles from licorice and apply them in a more reliable form than an oral tablet. I do not know whether that might be possible but I offer it as an area for future study.\n\nIn the meantime, I am of the opinion that mirifica, taken orally and also applied to the breasts in a cream or spray, is unlikely to impede growth brought on by pharmaceuticals and may help it along. In that case, there really is such a thing as ‘natural breast enhancement’ but only if one does not use herbs alone but rather uses them as additive treatments in addition to prescription HRT. \n\nAs a last note, I should say that palmetto and fenugreek could potentially be mixed together and made into a cream and applied directly to the breast. This *might*– emphasis on ‘might’ – be absorbed enough locally to encourage growth while not being absorbed enough throughout the whole body to experience the reproductive-toxic effects of fenugreek. I would still recommend caution with this approach, and I still think it would be a bad idea to do for more than a few weeks. \n\n**A Note on Safety**\n\nMany of these herbs which I call safe are only safe in the quantities typically given as treatment – for most, this amounts to between .5 and 4 grams. The problem is the ‘supplements’ market contains many products boasting of ‘strong extracts’ which, if you looked at their chemical constituents, would be the equivalent of 4 grams or more. (See, for an example, [this Ashwagandha extract from the quality Indian brand Himalaya](https://himalayausa.com/products/organic-ashwagandha) – Himalaya is a good brand and so I do trust their claim that one tablet is equivalent to 4600mg of herb. But that’s not per se a good thing. 4 grams is over the dose typically given of it to those who aren’t habituated, such that just one single tablet of the Himalaya extract could be ‘too strong’ a dose). The best way to dose is to use powdered herb measured with a scale or in teaspoons. Even this does not guarantee a consistent dose however as even some of those powders are ‘extract powders’ that are many times stronger than the herb itself.\n\nSo, given that consistency is hard to find, the best approach is the careful one, trying out just a little at a time to see if you feel anything. Many of these herbs have the advantage of causing at least some noticeable changes in mental state upon the first day to week in which they’re taken; so you can use this to adjust your dose and not rely on what some company claims is the optimal dose. In fact, I’d wager that with herbs, dosing tends to be more individual than in pharma treatments (since they seem to exert their effects mostly down-stream, and in a less predictable way). So, start with one herb at a time and go slowly in evaluating its effects. If one enjoys the experimental aspect of this, they might really like the herbal approach. IF, however, one would have a hard time moderating themselves in this manner, I’d suggest they go on pharma treatments fully before trying herbs. Though I do not have specific evidence to point to for this claim, it seems quite logical to me that herbs are less likely to cause hormonal side effects if one is taking consistent daily medications that they can use to guarantee their estrogen levels. That does not mean side effects CAN’T happen (and many of these estrogenics do not exert their effect by direct action on estrogen levels – such that the estrogen level could stay the same despite them having efficacy), but I am merely hazarding a guess that side effects would be less likely.\n\nSome of the herbs discussed here contain aromatic compounds that are available in extremely potent extracts known popularly as ‘essential oils’ (although these extracts are not actually oils and contain no fatty acids, but types of alcohol). Though some essential oils are more toxic than others, **all essential oils are extremely dangerous and are basically types of bleach - very strong, volatile and toxic solvents that will irritate the skin, lungs and digestive tract.** Even if the herb itself is extremely safe, the essential oil will still be highly toxic because of its concentration. To give a sense of how concentrated, it is said that there are over 2000 roses in a single drop of rose oil. Needless to say, **never consume anything made with essential oils, and do not mix any medical preparations with them unless you know how to do it exactly.** \n\nBut you might ask how it is that there exist some edible products sold at supermarkets that contain the essential oil if it is so toxic. For example, Fentiman’s rose lemonade is a soft drink that is infused with rose oil. The answer is that these products are made by experienced producers who know how to mix these oils and what percent is safe for consumption. If you lack that knowledge, don’t even try it. It is far harder to mix them into food than it might appear because of their thickness, and so the end result of using them can be a food product with the oil unevenly distributed, and eating this could make you sick. While some diffuse these oils in a diffuser, I personally find even this to be too irritating. I find the best way to use them is in waters, sprays and soaps formulated to have appropriate concentrations of these oils, as many of the oils which are toxic internally can be good when used on the skin. If some of the herb is wanted internally, it is better to get the plant itself and make a proper tea and leave the oils behind. \n\n**Estrogenics in skincare**\n\nSo much of the use of herbs in skincare is basically taking advantage of their hormonal effects. Name an herb that is commonly used on the skin, and nine out of ten times it generally has a clear effect on the levels of the two biggest sex hormones. If aromatics are applied to the skin, not as much is absorbed into the whole body; mostly it exerts its effect in the area of the skin where it was applied. I maintain that estrogenic herbs could play a role in helping trans people achieve gender goals related to their face and their skin. While it is of course extremely unlikely that topical treatments could do anything mimicking the long-term facial changes that occur after years of HRT, I am actually quite certain they can bring on some of the early changes HRT brings on in the face – skin smoothening and superficial fat reorganization. I have observed this myself, both in seeing before-after pictures of my own skincare regimen and that of others. Further, this is the entire principle behind a ‘spa treatment’, in which a number of estrogenic herbs are used to create a look of ‘youthfulness’ (which is to say, a feminized look.) There is a clear science behind this in that these herbs do exert clear hormonal effects, as I will now review. \n\nEstrogenic flowers seem well-suited for use in skincare.  The active ingredients in estrogenic flowers are usually aromatic compounds – linalool in lavender, geraniol in rose and rose geranium, etc. Aromatic compounds, unlike some other plant estrogens discussed earlier (e.g. isoflavones in PM and soy), are highly reactive and their effects don’t last long. Further, as compared to other estrogenics they seem to exert more immediate effects on mentality, with some describing some flowers and flower oils are ‘calming’, ‘stimulating’, etc, when applied to skin or used in a diffuser. \n\nThese aromatic compounds are the very same plant-alcohols which, as I said earlier, are present in large toxic concentrations in the ‘essential oils’ of the plant. If you want a high dose of them, you cannot take them internally in their essential oil as this is quite caustic and can give you a chemical burn or seizure. So, if you want systemic effects from them, you’d have to settle for a tea made from the whole flowers. I do say that lavender tea and rose tea create pleasant calming effects. I doubt however that either of these when used alone would ever cause any significant feminization of the body (e.g. breast growth). While there were reports of lavender oil and tea tree oil in a lotion causing breast growth, this was only four isolated cases in prepubescent boys and it would be very very unlikely in an AMAB adult with functioning genitals. \n\nOf flowers, the most estrogenic in [this study](http://nel.altamira.sk/userfiles/articlesnew/NEL370816A06.pdf) (as measured by the increases in saliva estrogen concentrations in the study participants) was found to be **rose**. Rose in the form of rose water is most efficaciously used in skincare as a toner, applied and rubbed into the skin after cleansing but before moisturizing. Any changes in the skin will be subtle at first and most apparent after consistent use.\n\nHowever, the very strongest estrogenic skincare herb is **Centella Asiatica**. While some take asiatica by mouth, and it is a potent [anti-androgen](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20589353/) and [estrogenic](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.5061907)  as evidenced by studies, to me it is inadvisable to take internally because this would make one develop a tolerance to it that may weaken its skincare effects. Centella asiatica’s estrogenic action in the skin takes the form of a potent, fast-acting skin calmer, [acting on the same neurotransmitters in the skin (GABA) that alcohol acts on in the CNS.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27062315/)  (Of course it won’t get you drunk, but you might feel a tiny buzz from heavy use of asiatica concentrates on skin. But your mileage will vary). Asiatica acts faster than most skincare treatments, as it is capable of quickly reducing redness in acne and shrinking it. Where other acne treatments mostly kill the acne, asiatica leaves it alone and just calms the skin by its strong estrogenic action. \nI maintain that trans people should use asiatica differently than genetic women. Genetic women typically use asiatica as a ‘spot treatment’, applied directly to acne or acne scars and capable of reducing the redness overnight (its efficacy at this was confirmed by my own experiments). However, trans people’s faces unlike genetic women’s faces need the estrogenic action all over. So, I have found the very quickest way to feminize the skin in my face is to apply strong asiatica ‘spot treatment’ all over my entire face (I use the ‘asiatica serum’ and ‘asiatic ampule’ by the brand CosRX, which are VERY concentrated). This creates a smoothening and shininess of the skin overnight which, by my judgement, results in a noticeable and quite quick feminization of the face.\n\nOne should take care not to overuse asiatica. Since its calming action is strong, one can develop a tolerance to it. It is best rotated and used a few times a week or even less depending on results; but one can perhaps use it on acne spots on a more consistent basis. \n\nNeem, an Indian herb, is mainly used on the skin as an acne or fungus treatment. It is powerfully anti-microbial. Pure neem oil is often dabbed onto a cotton swab in very small amounts (say, 1-5 drops) and then used as a ‘spot treatment’ for acne. Neem is [very strongly anti-androgen and when given in high doses in an oral extract reduced testosterone levels substantialy](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/399/1/012106/pdf#:~:text=Neem%20leaf%20extract%20affects%20the,into%20a%20male%20contraceptive%20candidate.) however [it is also anti-estrogenic too](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.4983425). It is ‘safe’ to take internally in the sense that it is not very acutely toxic (the lethal dose is very high), but the proper way to do it is only small amounts of powdered herb (1-3 tsp). (Of course never taken neem pure oil internally: see the note on safety.) An Indian doctor I talked to said neem must be rotated at least 2 weeks on/2 weeks off because taking it for too long internally could be damaging to the microbiome. This seems quite plausible given its strong anti-bacterial action.\n\n**Hormone balancers and adaptogens** \n\n**Shatavari** is a medicinal herb cultivated and used in India as a ‘beauty tonic’, that is, something taken regularly that is meant to encourage youthfulness. In practice, what ‘beauty tonic’ means is nothing other than that it is capable of causing some superficial feminization of outer features. In this author’s own experience, 4 weeks of shatavari caused subtle changes in the look of the face, which were subtle enough that no one could identify them specifically although one who did not know I am transitioning noticed that there was some kind of change (though they didn’t associate it with any gender). I myself began noticing changes after 2 weeks. Shatavari is known as an ‘adaptogen’, and what that means in practice is that it is neither a stimulant nor calming agent, but has different effects depending on one’s body.\n\nWhile Shatavari seems to be a powerful and potentially very useful herb, *it’s effects will GREATLY depending on the state of your hormones when you start it.* In men struggling with impotence, it actually increases testosterone. If estrogen is high, it can be anti-estrogenic. \n\nThough it is a daily medication in India, however, Shatavari is not to be taken lightly. **I do not recommend taking shatavari if one has recently increased their dose of hormones and anticipates large changes.** Shatavari is a hormone stabilizer. The main purpose of shatavari is to prevent any major drops in hormone levels one way or another. The second purpose is that it can be added for the aforementioned ‘beauty tonic’ effects (that is to say, slight, superficial facial feminization) ONLY if one has been on a stable dose for a while.\n\nShatavari can easily be overdone. I’d recommend not using any ‘bottled extract’ of shatavari as that will probably give too high a dose (some of those extracts are the equivalent of 4g or more of the powdered herb). Instead, start with 1-3 tsp of the herb mixed with warm water and drank; it could also be filtered into a tea if you wanted a more pleasant drink but weaker effect.\n\nShatavari appears to slightly increase progesterone, and is traditionally used as a ‘galactagogue’ to encourage the production of breast milk. However, I doubt very much that it can be relied on as a ‘progesterone treatment’ due to the other effects it has which might counteract any changes that could be brought on by the progesterone. \n\n**Other Herbs not reviewed**\n\nThere are many herbs used as supplements for hormonal conditions like menopause that I did not discuss here. I didn’t do so because I simply do not know much about them. This includes motherwort, which is sold as a menopause supplement in China; and evening primrose oil, which is also widely used as a menopause supplement. The only note I’d make on primrose oil is, one should probably mix it with food for better absorption. \n\nIf I were to add to this, I’d focus specifically on whether there are any herbs that can reliably and safely increase progesterone. (Though I discussed that shatavari has the potential to do this, it of course is not the reliable choice for this due to its many different and sometimes unwanted effects on hormones.) I’d also look into a safer alternative to fenugreek that might more specifically promote breast growth.\n\n**On the Concern that herbs may interfere with prescription treatments**\n\nSome worry that these herbs might actually counteract the effects of their prescription medications. This is sometimes a concern depending on the substance, but generally this worry is unfounded. The studies that show some of these to possess ‘anti-estrogenic’ effects usually get this result when these phytoestrogens are cultured in breast cancer cells. But if these are anti-estrogenic in cases where estrogen is making the body sick, such as breast cancer, that is a positive and not a negative. This type of study, which uses very high concentrations of the phytoestrogens, do not at all tell you what the phytoestrogen is doing in the body in the concentrations found in the blood from oral administration. Making this even more complicated is that many of these phytoestrogens seem to exert their effects beyond their direct and immediate action at the receptor, and seem to continue having some residual effects even after they are no longer in the blood (which explains why these herbal medicines can even work at all even when their bioavailability generally is found to be very low.) To me, it seems extremely unlikely that estrogen could be outcompeted or blocked by any of these compounds which bind to the estrogen receptor at generally much lower affinity than estrogen; so I doubt that any of these phytoestrogens usually block estrogen except in cases where estrogen is exceptionally low. And if it activates the receptors instead of estrogen in those cases where concentrations are very low, it might actually be more estrogenic than the endogenous hormone in those specific situations. All this is speculation, but it is just as much speculation as is the claim that phytoestrogens ‘block estrogen’. \n\nThese indirect effects might, rather than undermining estrogen when combined, work along with it: while estrogen binds to the receptor, these phytoestrogens might exert their effects down the line at other estrogen receptors, and could work in concert. Of course, as I make clear in this post there are some herbs that bind to estradiol receptors and are *definitely* anti-estrogenic (see neem.) And some herbs like pomegranate seem to be quite selectively anti-estrogenic. Pomegranate I judge to be very unlikely to initiate physical changes and may even slow them, as it appears to undermine the actions of the main estrogen b-17-estradiol. However, it directly activates a-17-estradiol receptors, the other type of estrogen receptor found mainly in the brain. I am not sure if this has any medical applications for trans people, but I give the example to show how varied the effects of these phytoestrogens can be. One must look specifically at what has been found about the specific herb in question. Even if we find it binds to estradiol receptors we must investigate more to see if it is a blocker, agonist, selective agonist or modulator.\n \nNow, I do not discount the possibility that some herbs which help some may interfere with the actions of estrogen in others. Hormones are very individual. If herbs are to be used at all, careful monitoring must be done.",

    "body": "Hi all, I was starting to comment on a recent post about this subject, which comes up quite a bit, and it got so long I thought it would be better suited to a post in the end.\n\n*So, the subject was \"naturals\" and it was being compared, sometimes, to \"chemicals\".*\n\nAs a chemist this was a predictable record scratch moment. So here I'm just gonna set down what I have learned from academia and experience as a chemical regulatory specialist which is my day job. Just as an aside, please don't think I'm bringing some sort of \"enlightenment\" because definitions and standards vary according to time, place, language, customs and more.\n\n\n- First off, *everything is chemicals*. It is very common to imagine \"chemical\" VS \"natural\" but this is a false dichotomy since every single material and thing is made of chemical substances. Water is a chemical substance and every thing we hold, consume, produce etc is made of chemicals, if you zoom in.\n\n- There can be debates about the *scope* of the word \"natural\": as we will see it is tougher to define than it might seem, and most legal definitions are different according to the body in charge. I suspect that most of these laws had to come up or be refined because products go on the market: to avoid greenwashing, for example, there is a need to set limits on what we can claim to be \"natural\". But just like all laws, they are written by humans for humans and thus this is all arbitrary.\n\n- *Generally, it is conventional to consider \"synthetic\" as an opposite to \"natural\".* Either the thing we're talking about comes from nature or it was synthesised, i.e. *\"made\"* through a chemical *reaction*. _If you mix A and B to make a C which was not there in the first place, then you have synthesised C._\n\n\n... Aaaaand the following points are where the consideration of \"natural\" gets blurry for us in all sorts of interesting ways.\n\n\n- A natural isolate, for example vanillin isolated from vanilla pods, was made by doing all sorts of things to the pod - which is itself a pod that was picked froma plant and then cured over a period of time. We extract one single substance (ie a \"chemical\") that is a _part_ of this vanilla pod. For example, changes in temperature, pressure, washing it with another set of chemicals etc etc. These are called _physical_ changes as opposed to _chemical_ changes, since we have not synthesised anything. Chemistry is when we study reactions. This is not a chemical change because there has been no reaction: the vanillin we end up with in the end was already in the starting material. So if C is our vanillin, it's ABCDEFGH(...) -> C. This is the same with essential oils, absolutes, CO2 extracts too. We can also call this process _refinement_: we took a thing and refined it to only keep a specific part of it.\n\n- An essential oil is what you get when you distill material from a plant: you heat it along with water (sometimes you stick the plant stuff in it, sometimes above so it's just steamed) and the oil is in the steam that comes out. Anyway, now let's think of natural oil. You know, crude oil. It is found in the ground. No human activity has helped it be in the ground: it is natural. It is not sustainable, though, on our scale: we take it away much more quickly than it appears so it's gonna run out. But it's natural! And we distill it and grab the steam, just like an essential oil. What we get on the other side is endless: right off the bat we get the following things from the steam and what's left in the still: gasoline, diesel, white spirit, kerosene, vaseline, asphalt... And of course some things that are used as starting points for reactions. There is no denying that the aforementioned substances are refined from a natural source, and the process reads exactly like an essential oil. I like this as an example of the fact that environmental damage does not simply come from synthesising things.\n\n- You can use synthesis to obtain a substance that already exists in nature. We know how to make a lot of common substances via synthesis now, it's just not always worth the hassle if they're already around us in natural things. Now let's look at the much-beloved ambroxide: this chemical already occurs in nature in ambergris. Ambergris comes from whales and is found on beaches. No whales are killed to get it, thankfully, because ambergris simply isn't \"ready\" when it's still in a whale's body. It kinda \"cures\" over time floating in the sea. It is extremely rare and one of the most expensive materials in the world. We love ambroxide and we synthesise a lot of it. We do it by starting from sclareol, which is an isolate from clary sage essential oil, and applying three reactions to it. None of these reactions involve petrochemicals. Setting up this manufacturing process and keeping it going requires materials and energy, yet we prefer to do this rather than sourcing ambergris and isolating the ambroxide in it. \n\n- To further the previous point, many substances that are common in nature but commonly synthesised too. Linalool, for example, is in loooaaads of herbs and flowers and fruits, which is why it's not too expensive to find as a natural isolate. But is also quite easy to synthesise from various starting points: you can make it from camphene which is itself a natural isolate, or from petroleum derivatives for example. So for a lot of substances we use in perfumery, whether they are mostly found as synthetic or natural simply depends on what is cheapest for businesses. They care about money and sometimes the cheapest process happens to align with ecological or social or ethical interests, sometimes it doesn't.\n\n- You can use synthesis to obtain substances that are (to our knowledge) non existent in nature. So they were, like, properly \"invented\". Creatively this is huge of course, because hey, brand new smells! Ecologically, the impact can vary wildly. Does the process involve a lot of energy? Does it use unsustainable substances? And as of the new substance, does it degrade in nature or not? Often with non-naturally-occurring substances there will be something about the molecule's structure that is familiar to the cells that break things down, and it is degraded like compost and so goes the circle of life. But some do not degrade, or do not degrade very fast, which poses a problem we have called bioaccumulation. They just hang around. This means we're accumulating waste which is a sustainability problem, but some of them will eventually be broken down over a few thousand or million years. Of course it's much _more_ of a problem when these substances cause _harm_ to life. The impact is unique to each of these substances.\n\n\nTo finish, I'd like to put forward 2 little talking points that influenced me a lot as an amateur perfumer:\n\n- Consider natural oud oil VS a substitute oud accord. The former is made by distilling the heartwood from old trees that were affected by a specific fungal infection that happens to something like 5% of them. Many new plantations have been launched, and we can artificially make sure that all of them get the infection. However, the wild oud trees are almost all gone and massive deforestation has occurred because of the demand. The other option is a mix of, let's say, 15 materials most of which are synthetic. By looking at the list of ingredients you will be able to see how each of these synthetic ingredients are made, and to what extent they are impactful to health and the environment. What would you rather use? The third answer, \"neither\", is just as valid of course.\n\n- Consider cinnamon, which is natural and very easy to procure. The law prevents you from using any more than a smidge of cinnamon oil in a perfume, because, well, it's really fckin bad for your skin. You may have seen stories of poor misguided/uninformed beauty influencers posting videos of DIY cinnamon face masks, and ending up with severe burns. As a matter of fact, some naturals are classified as CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic or reprotoxic) under law - like nutmeg oil, which is labelled \"may cause cancer\". In fact, most essential oils come with hazard warnings. It can be because the plant is dangerous as it is (hello cinnamon, or let's mention black mustard seeds that are eaten all over the world but an extract would be \"fatal if inhaled\") but also because EOs are like extremely concentrated versions of the plant: tarragon oil is labelled \"Suspected of causing genetic defects\" which would be the case if you ate handfuls and handfuls of tarragon - it's just that the oil is so strong that a few drops are needed. Now consider synthetic materials again: some are hazardous too, and some are not at all. Sometimes a hazardous synthetic material is made to replace a natural that is more hazardous. \n\n\nAs I hope you see, I'm not encouraging a stance here, just exhibiting all the juicy little quandaries that we can come to face.\n\nWould love to know your thoughts.",

    "body": "This segment was originally part of my [perfume basics guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/wiki/perfume_basics_guide), but I took it out because everything else already made it so long.  It's a short introduction to the fragrance industry itself, particularly laws (such as the legality of dupes and who decides what's safe) and the issue of the last decade or so of tightening industry regulations.  Since it's a big topic that I can't hope to cover comprehensively, there are a lot more links this time for additional food for thought, more in-depth reading, or other perspectives.\n\nI apologize ahead of time for being an American speaking about EU/UK/etc regulations (please let me know if I have misrepresented something), as well as the alphabet soup of acronyms strewn about here.  Organizations really do love their acronyms!  So after each section's TL;DR notes is a list of whatever acronyms I've added.\n\nIn order: legality of dupes, aroma chemicals, IFRA, and the controversy over industry regulations.\n\n#**Are dupes legal?**\n\nYes, dupes are completely legal.  Some store bottles will even openly declare if they were \"inspired by\" a popular fragrance.  Fragrance formulae are not patented; they are never filed on record.  To do so would reveal the structure of their perfumes, which goes against the general air of secrecy that dominates the fragrance industry.  There *is* a question of protecting formulae as a matter of [trade secrets](http://www.perfumerflavorist.com/fragrance/application/multiuse/148594615.html) [free article], but not every dupe was the result of stolen secrets.  If they are not purchasing stock fragrance from a distributor, perfumers have several ways to recreate fragrances, including gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis (GC-MS) or simply reverse engineering a close-enough clone.  The only people who aren't aware of what's probably in their perfumes are *consumers*.  Usually, if a brand trademarks anything, it's the names of their perfumes.\n\nPeople buy dupes for any number of reasons, including: the fragrance is discontinued, seasonal, or unavailable in their area; the fragrance does not come in preferred forms, such as a body lotion or solid, or the official product includes one or more ingredients they want to avoid; the consumer is personally boycotting the company or parent company; the price point is too high or doesn't come in smaller sizes; or they want to buy from a small business.  Please remember that not all small businesses disclose whether they are selling a product that uses a stock fragrance, including dupes. In my experience, when it's a dupe, the listing will add \"Type\" next to it.\n\n**In conclusion**:\n\n* Dupes and alleged clones are rampant in the fragrance industry, but they are legal.  Of course, just because they're legal does not mean it's morally acceptable to you.\n\n* In general, though they are undoubtedly aware of their existence, mainstream companies do not comment on clones.  Check out [this](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/news/revealed-lidls-4-perfume-smells-identical-to-chanels-70-scent--but-the-difference-is-in-the-bottle-9882258.html) and [their (somewhat inaccurate) damage control response](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2849602/Yes-4-bottle-perfume-smell-good-Chanel.html) for an example of a rare time that one did acknowledge a popular dupe.\n\n*Acronyms*\n\n>* GC-MS: Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis.\n>\n>>Unrelated, but cool to note: As mentioned in my perfume basics guide, woods such as sandalwood and agarwood (oud) are frequently smuggled.  In [this article](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/oregon-lab-helps-solve-worlds-crimes-nature/) it mentions a specialized mass spectrometer that helps investigators identify endangered plants and animals that may have been illegally traded.\n\n#**What are aroma chemicals?**\n\nIn perfumery, aroma chemicals are manufactured or altered smells: synthetic reproductions (\"nature-identical\") or isolates of natural aromas as well as [completely new artificial aroma chemicals](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/27/style/tmagazine/t_w_1532_1697_face_perfume_.html). This is an extremely simplified explanation of aroma chemistry, but [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoQOaE4rAYY) explains more about its history and [this PDF, Classifying Aroma Chemicals](http://perfumerbook.com/Classifying%20Aroma%20Chemicals.pdf), [which is intended for *perfumers* rather than consumers, so it's okay if it looks intimidating!] will give you a better idea of what perfumers or perfume houses mean when they say they work with aroma chemicals.  For the most part, we see aroma chemicals as synthetic, but it is possible for them to be (for some) \"natural,\" such as when aroma compounds are isolated from organic material ([but these are difficult for perfumers to define](http://anyasgarden.blogspot.com/2012/05/natural-isolates-and-natural-perfumer.html)).\n\nAlthough we may think of this as a relatively new industry, aroma chemicals have been used by perfumery since the mid 1800s.  Lab-produced aroma chemicals are as much a part of the modern perfumery tradition as are botanical extractions - they just have much bigger labs now.  Because of the close ties between smell and taste, the labs that produce aroma chemicals are part of the greater fragrance and flavor (F&F) industry.\n\nTo us as consumers, aroma chemistry means these labs can create materials that smell similar (if not identical to untrained noses) to the real thing without allergens, or eliminate allergens from raw materials by removing the molecules though complex filtration techniques.  Or they can create synthetic replacements for animalics such as civet.  However, increasing their usage in order to avoid natural allergens is not so simple; synthetic aromas are a health issue for some people - for example, increasing respiratory problems - and there are concerns about their [impact on the environment](http://davidsuzuki.org/issues/health/science/toxics/fragrance-and-parfum/).\n\nAdditional concerns: \n\n* Unlike natural extractions or perfume formulae, synthetic aroma chemicals *can* be patented: quite a few are proprietary.  The businesses that bulk buy from farms/plantations (such as Robertet) are also usually F&F labs: Givaudan, Firmenich, IFF, and Symrise together [own over 50% of the market](http://www.leffingwell.com/top_10.htm). [Here's [an interesting article that mentions Western fragrance corporations are looking to expand into Asia, in this case China](http://www.quinessence.com/blog/chinese-essential-oils-market-ht-by-recession), and how China's own producers/labs are encouraged to model their processes on Firmench's.]\n\n* The introduction of aroma chemicals provides perfumers (and us) with another alternative to over-harvested or rare naturals, such as [chemicals to simulate or replace ambergris](http://www.ecomagination.com/the-sweet-smell-of-synthetic-whale-ambergris).\n\n* They are more stable year to year than harvest variations for plants, so new batches are consistent.  However, decreased demand for naturals puts economical pressures on plantations and farms, which in turn affects materials availability for perfumers (increasing costs or becoming hard to find), potentially forcing a reformulation, price hike, or discontinuation.\n\n* Although many aroma chemicals are realistic and/or complex, to some, they are not as full-bodied as the natural.  After all, when you stop to smell real flowers, you are [actually smelling dozens, sometimes hundreds, of odor molecules](http://scienceline.org/2013/01/making-scents-the-aromatic-world-of-flowers/), whereas aroma chemistry reduces them to [the primary compounds](http://www.compoundchem.com/2015/02/12/flowers/) of the overall odor.  To some, the other dozens/hundreds of chemicals matter; to others, the synthetic is indistinguishable from the real material.  Like any component, there is a range in quality.\n\n* Aroma chemicals *can be* derived from either petroleum (petrochemicals) or turpentine (extracted from pine trees). From my limited research, they are *more likely* derived from petroleum.  Among other things, use of synthetics means *your perfume may not necessarily be phthalate-free*.\n\nNot every small-batch perfumer uses aroma chemicals directly, although they might use synthetics in general.\n\n**In sum**:\n\n* The use of aroma chemicals has been part of modern perfumery since its beginning, although arguably their presence has increased over the years (even if only because now *so many* everyday products are fragranced).\n\n* Synthetic materials offer positive and negative potential for consumers, such as offering an alternative to true animalics but simultaneously harming the environment.   There are also fewer labs in the world than there are farms and plantations, so sourcing options are also limited.  Although more labs are expanding or getting into F&F, not all of them will deal with small business accounts such as independent perfumers.\n\n*Acronyms*\n>* F&F: Fragrance and Flavors (or Flavors and Fragrance) industry.\n\n#**What is IFRA?  Do they make laws?**\n\nIn essence, IFRA *is* the fragrance industry.  IFRA stands for [International Fragrance Association](http://www.ifraorg.org/).  They are headquartered in Switzerland, with affiliated membership branches in [North America](http://ifrana.org) (US), [United Kingdom](http://www.ifrauk.org), Singapore, Mexico, and more [a full list of associated flavor & fragrance groups are listed [here](http://www.ifraorg.org/en-us/code-of-practice)].  Started in the 1970s, it is a self-regulatory fragrance industry advocacy group, who regularly updates guidelines (IFRA Standards; updates are known as Amendments) for fragrance creation, such as whether materials are restricted (limited) or prohibited due to safety concerns, as recommended by the Research Institute for Fragrance Materials Expert Panels (RIFM or REXPAN).  They are not a government body and do not pass laws; members are expected to comply with Codes of Practice (CoP), but membership is not compulsory.  Materials that are compliant with Standards are IFRA certified.\n\nEvery year or so, IFRA releases an Amendment that updates what materials (both natural and synthetic) are restricted or prohibited; if their status may be changed, they are known as endangered (at risk of restriction or prohibition in a future Amendment).  These guidelines are further organized into 11 categories of product, such as deodorants, mouthwash/toothpaste, and of course fine fragrances (Category 4).  Each one will list the safe limit for questionable substances, as advised by REXPAN.  For example, verbena *absolute* is restricted, but verbena *oil* is prohibited.  You can check out [IFRA's Standards database](http://www.ifraorg.org/en-us/standards-library/snew) for what else they've deemed restricted or prohibited and why.\n\nIt is a *misconception* that EU regulations follow IFRA guidelines, although there is some overlap and REXPAN does consult with other groups.  In fact, as the fragrance industry's advocacy group, it is IFRA's role to represent perfumers and [lobby for industry-favorable regulations](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.premiumbeautynews.com%2Ffr%2Fnotre-objectif-est-de-garantir-a%2C4306&edit-text=&act=url) [Google Translate of a French article].  Most of the time, a country's has its own system for determining materials safety and its own research commissions, and their conclusions do not necessarily agree with IFRA's.  In Europe, for example, they have the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) as well as other advisory bodies.  Although not an organization, the effects of [Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registration,_Evaluation,_Authorisation_and_Restriction_of_Chemicals) (REACH) has also been significant on the fragrance industry.\n\nIFRA members must adhere to Standards as well as local laws regarding their formulation - often, laws will be more strict than IFRA's guidelines.  Not always, however; in the US, fragrances and fragrance chemicals are subject to the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] and/or the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] and currently neither have as strong of a stance on the issue compared to Europe (although [that might be changing](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/14/ernest-istook-regulators-raise-a-stink-over-perfum/)).  Once regulations or Standards go into effect, it affects both material options as well as product availability.  If a perfume contains restricted or prohibited components, it can either be reformulated or discontinued.  As mentioned in the basics guide, these reformulations are not always exact.\n\nFor us as consumers, this means that IFRA-compliant perfumers may have a more limited palette to work with as both they *and* their suppliers accommodate the new guidelines.  Even if a perfumer chooses not to be an IFRA member or only follows Standards when it doesn't compromise their art (assuming they don't live somewhere that enforces stricter guidelines), they are still affected by it because of their suppliers.  For example, [50% of the world's 'fine lavender' comes from France](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/21/world/europe/21lavender.html), so not only are the fields subject to weather conditions, but also EU regulations and IFRA Standards affecting demand for its crop if, say, one or the other severely limit its use in products or perfumery.  Same with oakmoss, which is also primarily from Europe.  More on this in the Controversy section.\n\nVarious advisory groups and government organizations claim to have a consumer's best interests at heart: for some of us, their attempts go too far, or do it clumsily; for others, they [do not go far enough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_chemical_sensitivity). Although consumers should not be expected to understand chemistry or comprehend thick legal language, we should be aware of [potential biases](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/07/us-perfume-regulation-insight-idUSKBN0FC0EB20140707) and [critically examine whether they use sound science](http://colognoisseur.com/editorial-90-days-til-the-end-of-perfume/). Consumers deserve protection *and* transparency. \n\n**Notables**:\n\n* IFRA is not a government organization, nor is membership mandatory: it is there to protect perfumery interests as well as ensure standardized safe practices, but their Standards and CoP are sometimes criticized as controversial.  However, IFRA Standards are basically accepted as global industry standards, so a perfumer's noncompliance may affect product liability insurance coverage.  Even if a small-batch perfumer works outside the main industry, they are still effected by its regulations, especially access to materials.  Not all indie perfumers are IFRA members.\n\n*  Although indie perfumers may not be IFRA members, they must still obey whatever laws are applicable to their business.  However, every country's laws regarding what's safe varies.  Even in the US, some states have stricter regulations than others, so even within a country, some perfumers abide by different standards of safety.  For a mainstream example, in California, LUSH cannot ship or sell its spray perfumes and several The Body Shop products are also unavailable because of their ingredients or formulation, even if other states do not regulate the chemicals in question at all.\n\n* Controversially, [despite EU's ban of animal tested ingredients in *cosmetics*](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/11/business/global/eu-to-ban-cosmetics-with-animal-tested-ingredients.html), REACH does [require animal testing](http://echa.europa.eu/chemicals-in-our-life/animal-testing-under-reach) [[response to PETA here](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/reach/animal_en.htm)].  As of 2015, IFRA's Code does not explicitly forbid use of animal testing, but I did come across their [2006 Code](http://www.ifraorg.org/Upload/Docs/22083_GD_2009_11_03_IFRA_Code_of_Practice_Dec_06.pdf) that briefly mentions encouraging use of alternatives to animal testing when possible.\n\n*Acronyms*\n\n>CoP: IFRA's Codes of Practice, guidelines by which all IFRA members must abide.\n>\n>EPA: US Environmental Protection Agency\n>\n>FDA: US Food and Drug Administration\n>\n>IFRA: International Fragrance Association, based in Switzerland, but with international influence.\n>\n>REACH:  Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals, EU legislation.\n>\n>REXPAN:  Research Institute for Fragrance Materials' Expert Panels\n>\n>RIFM: Research Institute for Fragrance Materials\n>\n>SCCS: Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety, an advisory body for the European Commission\n\n#**What's the controversy?**\n\nSince the early 2000s (but especially in the past decade), regulations over fragrances and fragrance materials have increased, at least in Europe, which is basically the heart of the perfume industry.  This is not solely IFRA's effect, although some will claim that their latest Amendments *started* the movement.  Some [find the situation controversial](http://www.kafkaesqueblog.com/tag/ifra/) and I have even seen allegations that some of it is to force out small perfumeries.\n\nHere are some issues to consider:\n\n* [This Basenotes editorial](http://www.basenotes.net/features/3158-what-is-really-going-on-with-eu-fragrance-regulations) offers many insights into various concerns over increased regulations.\n\n* As mentioned in my basics guide, consumers often need to decode a lot to understand what they are being sold.  The same goes for regulations.  When the EU Commission wants to [ban atranaol and chloroatranol or restrict citral, courmarin, or eugenol](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/13/lk-perfume-eu-idUSL5N0LI4BQ20140213), the average consumer might not realize that they are talking about oakmoss and tree moss, lemon/tangerine oils, tonka beans, or clove and rose oils.  One of the chemicals regulated by the EU Commission is linalool, which is part of lavender.  As mentioned above, [France is famous for its lavender](http://www.rivieratimes.com/index.php/provence-cote-dazur-article/items/grasse-pushes-for-unesco-cultural-heritage-label.html) and it's an incredibly important economical trade for many farms who have sold to fragrance houses for generations.  Last year, [they protested that 'lavender was not a chemical'](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/lavender-farmers-rebel-against-eu-chemical-rules).  Many producers are likewise [unhappy with the situation](http://www.euronews.com/2013/07/26/allergic-reactions-trigger-blow-to-perfume-industry/).\n\n* Insufficient, inconsistent, and misleading labeling are common consumer concerns, although some mainstream companies are already responding by voluntarily making their labels more transparent.  Critics of EU/IFRA regulations claim that banning and severe restrictions should not have been the first solution to address consumer safety.  For example, in other industries that potentially (food) or definitely (tobacco) harm people both directly and indirectly, they are allowed to label products with warnings about health risks, such as potential nuts contamination or proven carcinogens.   Although some already print partial ingredient lists (*may* contain A, B, C, etc) on boxes, generally, most perfumes don't have warnings about risk for allergies.  IFRA does not have any guidelines about labeling.\n\n* Compliance with IFRA and regulations is bittersweet.  Many perfumers feel strongly about the subject: [Cropwatch's position](http://www.cropwatch.org/Perfumers%20and%20the%2040th%20IFRA%20Amendemnt%20by%20Tony%20Burfield.pdf) after the 40th Amendment was passed; the loss of oakmoss discussed in [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/07/us-perfume-regulation-insight-idUSKBN0FC0EB20140707) and [Wired](http://www.wired.com/2011/10/ff_perfume/); [Save Perfume's Soul](http://www.parfumo.net/petition/) petition; [the industry split](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/16/us-france-perfume-idUSBRE8BF02D20121216); [this video clip from IFRA NA](https://youtu.be/gU4OH80nmCo).   Many perfumers equally feel that the industry can work within limits, have suppliers step up their game [such as [scented yeast](http://news.discovery.com/tech/biotechnology/fungus-used-to-brew-up-new-fragrances-150307.htm)!], and still create great perfumes.\n\n**TL;DR**:\n\n* What's going on within and about the industry is complex and divisive.  Even if you purchase only from small-batch perfumeries that are on the fringes of the industry, we are still affected by these broader issues.  Since some of it inevitably involves international regulations or complex globalized economies, it is difficult for us as consumers to have a voice in what is happening except within our own countries or by raising awareness.",

It doesn’t take Einstein to figure out all the products from Avant are crap, even if this were $5 it would still be crap. There’s nothing wrong with the ingredients, its just the formulation and ingredients for the moisturizer isn’t worth more than $5, it has no high levels of any active ingredients/patented technology (almost all moisturizers at that price point has patents). If this were ingredients for a dollar store hand cream, then i would buy it, unfortunately it’s $134.  Avant products AREN’T EVEN WORTH the $12 Boxycharm add on/pop up price.\n\nLook at the ingredients for Acure Radically Rejuvenating Whipped Night Cream ($15.99 on iherb.com) \n\nWATER/AQUA/EAU, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CETEARYL OLIVATE, SORBITAN OLIVATE, SCLEROCARYA BIRREA (MARULA) SEED OIL, NYMPHAEA ALBA ROOT EXTRACT, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-1, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-2, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-1, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-9, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-11, COPPER PALMITOYL HEPTAPEPTIDE-14, HEPTAPEPTIDE-15 PALMITATE, PALMITOYL TETRAPEPTIDE-7, PALMITOYL TRIPEPTIDE-1 (PEPTIDE BLEND), FERULIC ACID, ASCORBIC GLUCOSIDE (VITAMIN C), COCONUT ALKANES, PSEUDOALTEROMONAS FERMENT EXTRACT (GLACIAL GLYCOPROTEINS), SALICYLIC ACID COCO-CAPRYLATE/CAPRATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ASPARTIC ACID, LINOLEIC ACID, LINOLENIC ACID, LECITHIN, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, LACTIC ACID/GLYCOLIC ACID COPOLYMER, CURCUMA LONGA (TURMERIC) ROOT EXTRACT, SYMPHYTUM OFFICINALE CALLUS CULTURE EXTRACT.\n\nBesides the fact that this has way more antioxidants/age prevention/hydrating ingredients.  This ingredients list for a $16 moisturizer might look familiar to some people because it’s like 95% the same as a certain Drunk Elephant Moisturizer(it’s just missing a few amino acids at the end of the ingredients list but all the important ingredients are exactly the same, even the peptides are the same).  Looks a thousand times better than all the crappy $130 Avant Moisturizers, and this is just one example, there’s CeraVe, Elf, tons of Korean brand moisturizers, all around or under $20. \n\nDECIEM’s hand cream $16 for 100ML\nAqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propanediol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Copper Lysinate/Prolinate, Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Methylglucoside Phosphate, Proline, Alanine, Serine, Pseudoalteromonas Ferment Extract, Tremella Fuciformis Sporocarp Extract, Tocopherol, Betaine, Cellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Sodium Phosphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Parfum (Fragrance), Limonene, Linalool.\n\nThere’s copper peptide (the next big thing in anti aging), snow mushrooms, amino acids, algae ferment, and Plantago Lanceolata which can reduce dark spots, all this from a hand cream, people were using this as a facial moisturizer cos it’s that good. \n\nMoisturizers which are around $134\n\n- Guerlain’s Abeille Royale Creams (has patent on formulas and also the frigging jar the moisturizer comes in) \n\n* Sisley Black Rose Cream Mask (really this needs no introduction) \n\n* Charlotte Tilbury’s Night Cream\n\n* Dior Capture Totale Firming and Wrinkle Correcting Cream (Again patented formula, with a lot of research and clinical trials)\n\n* Lancer Skincare the Nourish (Dr. Lancer dermatologists for Hollywood Stars) \n\n* Fresh Creme Ancienne Moisturizer (Literally made by hand in a Monastery in Europe) \n\n* Chanel Le Lift Restorative Cream (clinical and in vitro testing, patented formula) \n\n* Caudalie Premium Cru Rich/Normal Cream (again patented formula, developed with Harvard Medical School) \n\n* If you check out CultBeauty the Eve Lom holiday set (the one with the Moisture Cream and cleanser (all full size) are basically the same RV as the stupid Avant moisturizer. \n\nThe list can go on forever, also Anti pollution micellar water from Chanel only costs $45. If you take a look at the ingredients for Avant’s Micellar Water it’s missing a very crucial ingredient that the majority of “high end/effective” micellar water contain, PEG-6 Caprylic/ Capric Glycerides.  Seriously this is not even worth $1. \nLastly someone from this subreddit did some research on this company, I think she concluded it was being used to launder money. But the fact that they’re selling you crap for $100+ is enough proof for me.\n\nNow the 111skin products we get from boxycharm or Ipsy are NOT the same as the ones sold in retail stores or 111skin’s online site.  The hydra gel moisturizer that came from Ipsy for example has a completely different ingredients list from the “real” moisturizer.\n\nIngredients from 111skin Cryo Activating Hydra Gel Ipsy version: \nAloe Barbadensis Gel, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Butylene Glycol, Isohexadecane, Dipropylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond / Amande Douce) Oil, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Betaine, Lecithin, Pyrus Malus (Apple / Pomme) Fruit Water, Allantoin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Hydroxyacetophenone, Trehalose, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Aluminium Dicetyl Phosphate, BHT, Tetrasodium EDTA, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow / Achillée) Extract, Xanthan Gum, Menthol, Menthyl Lactate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Fragrance / Parfum, Limonene, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Linalool.\n\nIngredients from 111skin’s site for the Hydra Gel:\nAQUA / WATER / EAU, NELUMBO NUCIFERA (LOTUS) ROOT WATER, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, GLYCERIN, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND / AMANDE DOUCE) OIL, SODIUM ACRYLATES COPOLYMER, CARBOMER, TETRAHEXYLDECYL ASCORBATE, ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, BETAINE, LECITHIN, PROPANEDIOL, BENZYL ALCOHOL, HORDEUM VULGARE (BARLEY / ORGE) SEED EXTRACT, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PRUNUS PERSICA (PEACH / PÊCHE) JUICE, PYRUS MALUS (APPLE / POMME) JUICE, TRITICUM VULGARE (WHEAT / BLÉ) SEED EXTRACT, DISODIUM EDTA, PANAX GINSENG ROOT EXTRACT, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, TRIHYDROXYSTEARIN, ACHILLEA MILLEFOLIUM (YARROW / ACHILÉE) EXTRACT, SODIUM HYALURONATE, MENTHOL, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, ALOE VERA LEAF EXTRACT, GLYCERYL UNDECYLENATE, MENTHYL LACTATE, XANTHAN GUM, GLUCOMANNAN, FRAGRANCE / PARFUM, BENZYL SALICYLATE, LIMONENE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL.\n\nSee the difference? The Ipsy one although it advertises that it’s made with lotus water, there’s no lotus anything in the ingredients. It’s full of texture enhancers and solvents, IMO they were mainly trying to copy the “gel texture” of the real moisturizer.  The real moisturizer that’s $200 isn’t that much better. No expensive ingredients or actives....Check out the Rovectin Lotus Water Cream, made from 75% lotus flower extract (I’m assuming extracts holds a lot more nutrients than lotus root water), and it’s $20 but it goes on sale for $10, has similar light texture etc etc.  Usually the “made for beauty boxes 111skin products” will have “Made in China for 111skin” on the packaging. The real products use to be made in Bulgaria and now I think it’s made in UK, and some are made in the US.  Even if the ingredients line up like the 111skin vitamin c serum from Ipsy and the old formula of the vitamin c from 111skin’s site, the texture, colour, smell are completely different.  The real one had a serum like texture, transparent, had some kind of smell (I forgot the smell, I compared the products like a year ago).  The Ipsy version has the texture of water, yellow tint, no smell I think. Even the real products from 111skin are total ripoffs...what the hell does that say about the “fake” ones? \n\nTL:DR - both Avant and 111skin products are crap, 111skin sends out fakes to beauty boxes but even the real products are crap.  Avant is a sketchy company and their products aren’t even worth the $12 add on price.  It doesn’t matter if Avant’s website looks legitimate, every MLM website looks a thousand times more legitimate than Avant but it’s still a scam.",

On their Instagram they even have a FAQ where someone asks who the CEO/Founder is, and they say that \"They don't focus on the CEO/Founder but the brand only\"\n\nNot to mention their website copy is absolute garbage and super vague, and though they say they're back by science it seriously just seems like they are using science-washing terms. \n\nCame on reddit and saw this post that validated everything I was feeling.",

    "body": "Gas Cake is an indica leaning hybrid cultivar created by the infamous Californian breeder Jungle Boys. Made by crossing High Octane x Jungle cake, cultivated and hand crafted by Ostara Medica. \n\nTotal Terps: 3.67%. Dominant Terps: Myrcene (1.98%), Beta-Caryophyllene (0.27%), Limonene (0.25%), Linalool (0.25%). \n\nOpened the tub and man it stunk the car out with some gassy creaminess 👌, so i drove home and properly opened it to look through the flower and wow. I definitely could smell a Citrus Gas for sure, with a nice blend of fruity berry (similar to Woodford), Vanilla cake and cake frosting. The Flower has Medium Sized structures with Vibrant Orange Pistols, Light green along with Sparkling Trichomes. \n\nOnly had this two days now and the first night I can say I slept like a baby and I did not want to wake up and get out of bed the next day my body was so relaxed and eased. The high Mycrene % offers a strong body relaxation and full body pain relief, also with the help of the second dominant terpene Caryophyllene which also aids in the same. Limonene helping by creating uplifting and happy feelings, clearing the mind of heavy thoughts, helping to ease symptoms of depression. I did also read that the Gas Cake is free of plant growth hormones (PGR), and free of gamma irradiation to preserve and optimise the chemical terpenoid structure, which I can for sure say the terpenes are rocking with with one. \n\nSet up the ball vape to 545, clearing it in 2-3 inhales. First hit was very vanilla/cakey along side some heavy gassiness. The berry, citrus and cake frosting taste came straight after. Very delicious strain. The 2nd and 3rd hit still tasted really nice, so much so I did go for a 4th hit but started to get the burning taste from nearly combusting. The effects hit me like a truck, the high amount of terpenes got me coughing like a Mother f*cker. Heavy squinty eyes, body feels like I’m dragging it through the ocean, easily moving but like jello, body feels nice a calm and relaxed and the physical pain from work slowly started to ease.\n\nThis and the Woodford are two strains that are very powerful for me, I haven’t noticed many strains do much for me in terms of therapeutic effects and psychoactive effects. However these blends of terpenes are doing wonders for me. If you’re noticing some strains aren’t working I would give this a shot especially for anyone who struggles with sleep. \n\nTaste/Effect I’d give this a 9.5/10. \n\n\n",

Listening to doctors and experts telling me I would always need steroids and antibiotics. Then listening to TSW victims and experts tell me to be patient. After 6+ years of patience, I finally decided to go back to elimination diets. If I were a dog, they'd change my diet. None of the traditional allergen removal diets worked for me. An Everylywell food sensitivity test and the whole 30 diet finally revealed that chicken was my main trigger. So Weird! I removed all bird including eggs, along with fragrance (Limonene and Linalool - identified with regular allergy testing), and my skin is 99% clear most of the time. Some outdoor workouts + sunscreen trigger a heat induced inner elbow reaction but it clears up in a few days. I'll take it. Life is so much better. Thought I'd share in case it helps anyone else figure out their own triggers. Good luck. It's a lonely battle, I know.",

    "body": "Used to be a huge fan but I am so over it considering their online behaviour and some shady practices. My skin loves their products because it's very sensitive and DE has been the only brand I can find aside from The Ordinary to not use fragrance, essential oils, parabens, sulfates and linalool. For reference, my skin was very irritated after using the Eve Lom Cleanser twice and my skin was extremely sensitive and angry with me after Summer Fridays Jet Lag mask.\n\nSo far, I want to replace all of my DE staples with better, more effective products:\n- Lala Retro Moisturizer (my HG for those delicious ceramides) - can't find a dupe at all\n- Protini \n- A-Passioni \n- C-Firma (I swear this thing just lightly tans my face and does nothing anyway) - I replaced this with Hylamide C25 but the texture makes it hard to layer over it without pilling. Would appreciate an alternative\n- B-Hydra (I enjoy this but feel it's not worth the price tag) - I replaced this with TO's Hyaluronic acid which I love, but it pills with a lot of my other serums so I would like a suggestion for an alternative.\n\nMy main concerns are hydration and hyperpigmentation. \n\nI've been interested in REN and Tatcha but I believe REN still uses parabens and linalool in some products. Regardless, would love any help, thanks!",

        "body": "I always suggest that people avoid sticking to a single brand. Most brands have a couple knockout products and then the rest is meh or isn’t necessarily for your skin type. You also may get a lot of repeat ingredients instead of an array of skin beneficial ingredients. I would definitely look at Korean alternatives especially - less expensive, better formulated, and more options to fit your criteria. I’ll include a list of alternatives for each product you mentioned below. First though, have you actually had a reaction to parabens or are you just avoiding them because of all the misinformation out there? Parabens are some of the better tolerated preservatives and were even named Non Contact Allergen of the Year where other preservatives often seen in so called “clean beauty,” like phenoxyethanol, are far more irritating.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Lala Retro Moisturizer**\n\n- Pyunkang Yul Intensive Repair Cream. Entire brand is sensitive skin friendly and this is a rich barrier cream that combines shea butter with ceramides, copper peptide, and beta glucan ($20 on Amazon/iHerb/YesStyle).\n\n- illiyoon Ceramide Ato line. Contains what they call their Ceramide Complex which features their encapsulated ceramides. They have everything from a lotion to their Concentrate Cream ($15 on Amazon, $22 on YesStyle) though I think the PY is better personally and the Cerave Skin Renewing Night Cream is even better but Cerave uses parabens.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**DE C Firma**\n\n- Skin Actives Vitamin C Serum. Features everything that makes the DE effective - correct PH and concentration, Vit E and feralic acid to stabilize and slow oxidation, and air/light tight packaging plus other great ingredients. I think it’s better tbh and not tinted orange. They also have their Antioxidant serum if you want to ditch the L-AA and just use several antioxidants in the AM under sunscreen to help protect against UV ($20 on their website).\n\n- Dr Brenner Vitamin C Serum. More of a dupe for Skincueticals but most well formulated L-AA serums are the same anyway. Downsides are less beneficial ingredients and it’s in dropper packaging vs the Skin Actives but it’s also $16.99 on Amazon which is convenient.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Protini Peptide Cream**\n\nThe Andre Lorent Crazy Beautiful Face Creme used to be a very similar affordable alternative on Amazon due to the peptides and the lighter consistency but I think it was discontinued. I personally like to see my peptides in my hydrating serum with HA and other humectants since they’re also water binding so I’m going to include a few serums. These aren’t dupes but alternatives.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Bonajour Green Tea Water Bomb. Somewhere between a cream and gel unlike the Protini but similar moisturizing level and just fantastic ingredients. Green tea extract, niacinamide, Polyglutamic Acid plus other humectants like HA and glycerin, copper peptide and 5 other peptides, panthenol, allantoin, and more. Really nice and high concentration of active ingredients ($16 on Amazon). \n\n- Ebanel Retinol Peptide Serum or their Hyaluronic Peptide Serum. The retinol one combines 7 peptides with hydroxypinacolone retinoate, retinol, retinol palmitate, arbutin, and other beneficial ingredients. The HA one combines 9 peptides with HA, panthenol aka B5, and some oils toward the bottom so it’s a bit moisturizing too ($13 and $12 on Amazon).\n\n- IQ Natural Line Reducing Serum. This is one of my favorites, it only has 2 peptides but they’re two of the better researched ones and in high concentrations plus there’s HA, aloe vera, and other humectants. Super hydrating and effective ($12 on Amazon, also sold on their website).\n\n- Cos de Baha Peptide Cream. Entire brand is simple yet effective. Aloe, niacinamide, allantoin, panthenol, green tea, plus argireline and matriculation 3000 the two peptides mentioned in the IQ serum. Their peptide toner is nice too (Cream is $11 on Amazon). \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**A-Passioni**\n\nAffordable retinol products are hard to find and this is the single area where I would suggest at least spending $40+. A true 1% that isn’t encapsulated or buffered is hard to find under that price point.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Paula’s Choice Retinol 1%. Not only has the retinol but is packed full of skin barrier friendly ingredients to minimize irritation and dryness ($58 on their website but they often have 20% off with free shipping).\n\n- so called “medical grade” brands often have great .5 and 1.0 retinol products like Obagi Medical, Skincueticals, Skin Medica, and Neostrata. Retinaldehyde is one step closer to retinoic acid and Avene, MediK8, and Osmosis have good ones. I saw the Obagi Retinol 1.0 on Overstock.com for only $35 recently btw but I would check and make sure it’s real. Just check for parabens and essential oils on these brands, I know they are fragrance free but not sure on the rest.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**B-Hydra**\n\n\nThis is basically a water based hydrating step that you use under moisturizer. You could easily use one of the Peptide serums I mentioned above as this step or any hydrating toner. But I’m going to list some of my favorite hydrators that hydrate the skin at multiple different depths. Always apply on damp skin and seal in with moisturizer immediately. I find the TO HA very sticky and unpleasant plus I think 2% is too high of a concentration if you’re not using multiple molecular weights of HA.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Rovectin Activating Treatment Lotion. 7 molecular weights of hyaluronic acid, sodium PCA, glycerin, panthenol, allantoin, niacinamide, caffeine, centella asiatica, papaya enzymes, and their beneficial ingredients. Superior to the B-Hydra and you get way more product ($17 YesStyle or $28 Amazon). My other favorite is the Hada Labo Premium Lotion which has 5 forms of HA and 3% urea but has parabens.\n\n- Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Toner Plus. They updated their original HA toner formula and it’s much nicer. 5 molecular weights of HA, sodium PCA, birch juice, centella asiatica, chamomile extract, panthenol, beta glucan, etc. They also have their HA Essence which is more moisturizing and gel like.\n\n- Cos de Baha Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum 1%. I’m adding this very simple serum for anyone who has extremely sensitive skin. It has only high molecular HA which mainly hydrates the surface of the skin where low molecular weights penetrate deeper depending on size and can cause slight inflammation/irrrsrion in the extremely sensitive. The only other ingredients are distilled water and 1,2-hexanediol an incredible mild preservative that’s typically used as a preservative booster not alone and is also hydrating. This serum is safe for microneedling too, just as an extra bonus ($9-16 on Amazon depending on size). \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Additional recommendation**\n\nI noticed that you mention your main concerns are hyper-pigmentation and hydration but I don’t see a product that is formulated with ingredients to actual inhibit melanin formation and treat hyper-pigmentation. You can just pick up a 2% hydroquinone cream for cheap but I’ll include some other great products that don’t contain hydroquinone and can therefore be used more than 2-3 months at a time. I would also suggest a gentle AHA as your exfoliating step which will allow products to penetrate better and hydrate while you exfoliate.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Dearskin Tranexemic Acid serum. This actually covers both the pigment inhibitor and the AHA I just mentioned, it’s absolutely packed with ingredients. Under 5% glycolic acid so low irritation there plus 5% tranexemic acid and kojic acid, niacinamide, licorice extract, Vitamin C, and other brightening ingredients ($14 on Amazon).\n\n- JJ Labs Tranexemic Acid and Kojic Acid serum. Very simple ingredients without any filler but effective ($17 on Amazon/Etsy).\n\n- Isntree AHA Essence. Very gentle exfoliant with soothing ingredients to minimize irritation and just a very hydrating and brightening formula ($15 YesStyle/Amazon)\n\n- By Wishtrend Mandelic Acid Prep Water. Great exfoliating toner, good option for very sensitive skin since it’s even gentler than the Isntree due to the 5% mandelic acid and has a higher PH. If you’re extremely sensitive then this is a good transition step to the Isntree but if you’re fine with the DE retinol I think you can go straight to the Isntree one. Also has lots of soothing, hydrating ingredients ($18 on Amazon).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhew. That was long. Wanted to give you lots of options and also show you that the best product for each category isn’t necessarily from the same brand. And Korean brands have really changed the market thanks to brands like Isntree that are free of irritants but full of fantastic ingredients. Hope that helps!",

        "body": "Honestly, if your skin is very sensitive, you'll be better served by cherry picking your products rather than adopting a brand. Avoid Sephora for skincare. Most skincare there is overpriced, fragranced and irritating. REN is supposed to be for sensitive skin but I couldn't handle their eye cream. Get well versed in effective ingredients and go bare bones with your routine. (Paula's Choice has great skincare articles and Dr. Dray on YT explains ingredients very well.) I'm sure you can find effective replacements for your products in dermatological lines and the drugstore. \n\nFirst step to addressing hydration is making sure you're not using anything irritating on your skin. Getting properly hydrated skin should not require five layers of product if your skin is cleansed, not stripped of its natural oils. Hyperpigmentation is a tricky one because most recommended ingredients are irritating to sensitive skin. You could look into in-office peels or lasers for that. A dermatologist could advise you best. In the long run, it's cheaper than buying a slew of ineffective brand-name products. And of course, sunscreen is essential. \n\nI'm sorry if I'm saying anything obvious. I'm just sharing my experience based on decades of struggling with my sensitive skin. The world of skincare is incredibly seductive but it's a minefield for anyone with sensitive skin.",

Their vitamin C serum is hit or miss for some people. I like it personally.\n\nI use Curology for my retinol and The Ordinary for my oil. Their rosehip, squalane, and chia oils are all a great value. \n\nEdit: I also use Supergoop for my SPF. I love all their products but mostly the Everyday sunscreen. No scent and doesn't burn my eyes. Does well under makeup.\n\nSPF is probably the only thing I don't use or like from the first aid beauty line.

Some people swear by First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream, but I'm not a fan of it because it contains eucalyptus oil. It does contain a ceramide. Stratia Liquid Gold - this is a beautiful oil-based ceramide cream serum. The Ordinary NMF - doesn't contain ceramides but it does contain a ton of natural moisturizing factors including amino acids, urea, fatty acids, phospholipids, etc.\n\nC Firma - literally any other well formulated Ascorbic Acid serum on the market, just make sure it's Ascorbic Acid and pH is under 3.5. I highly highly recommend Timeless. Nufountain and Maelove are also good, but Timeless is more affordable and more stable than any other Vitamin C product I've used.\n\nB Hydra - there are soooo many equally good, if not better hydrating products on the market.

Isntree Hyaluronic Acid toner. Hanskin Hyaluron Essence. Elf's Water Essence. Neogen Real Ferment Micro Essence. CosRx Galactomyces Essence. I could go on.\n\nProtini - good luck.

I was very much surprised by the ripe banana aroma as ive never come across a strain with that characteristic so I was pleasantly surprised.\nTaste is pretty much the same as the fragrance notes, flavours made of citrus, apple and ripe banana.\nEffects are very similar to Georgia pie which offers an extremely mood uplifting relaxing feeling but not heavily sedating, perfect for unwinding after work to decompress and maybe get some chores done. Effects hold up very long so redosing isn’t really needed which is great if you wanna save money.\nOverall it’s a home run strain and easily in my top 5 of all time.\nI highly recommend using this strain with a temperature controlling vaporiser for maximum terp taste and health beneficial effects hence start at a lower temperature and slowly go up.\nTemperatures- caryophyllene 160, limonene 170, linalool 190, Myrcene 160, Pinene 160.\nIf you have any more questions drop a comment.\nScore: 9.5/10.

I actually meant to grab the regular gold bottle to try but I was super sleep deprived (just flew from NYC to Singapore), forgot which color the regular sunscreen that everyone raves about was, and picked this up instead. I couldn't find many reviews about it so I thought I'd do my part and leave one because I ended up really liking this product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCost:\n\n\\- SGD $24.72/25ml from Watsons\n\nFor comparison, the regular gold bottle Anessa Perfect UV Sunscreen Skincare Milk is listed at SGD $27.93/60ml \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIngredients: \n\nDIMETHICONE･ALCOHOL･ZINC OXIDE･WATER (AQUA)･METHYL METHACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER･ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE･DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE･CAPRYLYL METHICONE･TITANIUM DIOXIDE (CI 77891)･BUTYLENE GLYCOL･OCTOCRYLENE･HDI/TRIMETHYLOL HEXYLLACTONE CROSSPOLYMER･DEXTRIN PALMITATE･SILICA･TRIFLUOROPROPYLDIMETHYL/TRIMETHYLSILOXYSILICATE･DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE･PETROLATUM･TITANIUM DIOXIDE･ISODODECANE･PEG-9 POLYDIMETHYLSILOXYETHYL DIMETHICONE･PPG-17･IRON OXIDES (CI 77492)･MICA･BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE･ALUMINUM HYDROXIDE･ISOSTEARIC ACID･IRON OXIDES (CI 77491)･DISTEARDIMONIUM HECTORITE･STEARIC ACID･TRISODIUM EDTA･PEG/PPG-14/7 DIMETHYL ETHER･POLYSILICONE-2･LITHIUM MAGNESIUM SODIUM SILICATE･FRAGRANCE (PARFUM)･BHT･TOCOPHEROL･LIMONENE･GLYCERIN･SODIUM METABISULFITE･IRON OXIDES (CI 77499)･LINALOOL･SODIUM ACETYLATED HYALURONATE･\n\n(list taken from watsons website)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUV filters:\n\n\\- Zinc Oxide, Octinoxate, Titanium Dioxide, Octocrylene, Uvinul A Plus, Tinosorb S\n\n&#x200B;\n\nClaims:\n\n\\- supposed to be good for sports\n\n\\- non-sticky and shine-free look\n\n\\- sweat and water resistant\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinish:\n\nSatin, though depending on what you layer underneath it can be quite dewy. On it's own it's quite a natural finish but I usually layer it over Stratia liquid gold and the Soon Jung 2x barrier cream, both of which are fairly dewy. Even so the end result with this bb base was a glowy look that didn't cross the line to oily. It sets pretty well on its own, but I found that I needed to powder it a bit mainly due to what I was layering underneath. Without powdering it did crease a little bit on my eye area though again, I believe that's mainly due to my layers underneath. Also, creasing of products on my eye area is also fairly normal for me due to my lid shape.\n\nI was also worried about this being drying due to the alcohol but found it to be ok. I recently started tret so my skin has been SUPER dry but this didn't dry me out more, which I really appreciated.\n\nAlso, I was really happy that this was not streaky at all even when applied with my fingers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConsistency:\n\nFairly watery, though it's not running off my hand or anything. It's very thin and spreads easily. This is more oily than sticky on initial feel, but once it dries down a bit it just feels like moisturized skin to the touch. It's very light and I don't feel like I'm wearing anything at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCoverage:\n\nThis had surprisingly high coverage. I was expecting it to be fairly sheer just going off the consistency but this was actually more high coverage than my usual tinted moisturizer (Laura Mercier oil-free). I have a fair amount of scarring on my cheeks from cystic acne and I would say this covered up about 90% of it. It was enough coverage that I don't find myself reaching for any additional concealer or foundation products. I also didn't get any weird texture or patchiness on my nose area which tends to be an issue for me. [Here](https://imgur.com/qpbc7lB) is a picture of my cheek scarring with just moisturizer. [Here](https://imgur.com/wq3ZpDl) is the same cheek with the Anessa. In the pictures, my face appears to have a bit of a whitecast, but if you look at the \"bare skin\" pic my face is already slightly lighter than my neck, probably because I don't always bring my sunscreen down on my neck like I'm supposed to 😬\n\n&#x200B;\n\nColor:\n\nI bought the shade natural.\n\nSo my closest foundation match is the non-AB shade Punjab from NARS. It's described as \"medium with golden undertones\". My closest AB match is the Missha M Magic Cushion in #27. This bb cream was nearly a perfect match for me. I'm not too sure how it would look on people significantly lighter or darker on my skintone though given that the coverage is fairly high. [Here](https://imgur.com/T7q5tQp) is what the Anessa looks like right out of the bottle. I was pretty surprised by how dark it looks. [Here](https://imgur.com/SkxJdCE) is what it looks like spread out on the back of my hand. You can kinda see it did make my hand look the slightest bit orange, which I think is because the dot amount was too much for the back of my hand, but it makes me think this could work for someone who may even be a couple shades darker than I am.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStaying Power:\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by how well this sunscreen kept up throughout the day. I was a little worried about transferring (especially since I had it layered over the Soon Jung barrier cream which is somewhat greasy) but was pretty pleased by how little it transferred. [Here](https://imgur.com/moXVdEf) is a picture of a transfer test I did. This was about 30 min after applying. I pressed the paper towel firmly to each section of my face twice (cheeks, nose, forehead, chin). Even though a bit of color does come off on the paper towel there weren't any noticeable patches missing on my face. Even after a long day in very humid and hot Singaporean weather the coverage looks really good. When I sweat and dab my face off I do get a tiny bit of transfer, but nothing crazy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther things to note:\n\n\\- this does have a bit of a floral fragrance to it. It fades after application but is noticeable when you first apply, so that's something to take note of if you are averse to fragrance. I will say though that despite the fragrance and despite alcohol being fairly high in the list I didn't experience any irritation or breakouts. I started tret a week or so ago and am currently experiencing a fair amount of stinging even with basic moisturizing products so I was really surprised that I didn't experience any stinging from the Anessa.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall:\n\nI am a huge fan of this product. The color, coverage, and finish are all perfect for me and I really appreciate the UVB/UVA ratings as well as the water and sweat resistance. I do wish it was a bit cheaper, but tbh this one product has replaced my usual combo of sunscreen + tinted moisturizer so I'll really be saving money in the long run. I haven't even reached for my concealer anymore so that's one more product I may (potentially) be able to cut out. Plus it's one less step for me to do in the morning which is always great. 10/10 will be buying again and this has replaced my previous holy grail sunscreen which was the Biore UV watery essence. I plan on getting the regular gold bottle Anessa sunscreen when this runs out just to see how similar they are, but for now I'm really happy with the bb base.\n\n[Picture album](https://imgur.com/a/mImohya) with demonstrations of coverage, color, and transfer test.",

Even if this is the case, I've observed that people who've used these types of shampoos all their life *exclusively* have never experienced buildup nor had their hair weighed down so how does the Dimethicone in a sulphate shampoo work?  For example, in a shampoo with the ingredient list mentioned below, how would Dimethicone and sodium laureth sulfate behave? This might seem a bit silly, (but I'm trying to educate myself on the issue rather than avoiding products in fear entirely) since shampoo is primarily focused on the scalp does the silicone deposit on it?\n\nAqua/Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Dimethicone, Coco-Betaine, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Chloride, Ci 42090/Blue 1, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Mica, Coconut oil, Eucalyptus globulus leaf oil, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, Steareth-6, Acetic acid, Peg-100 stearate, Peg-45M, Argilla/Magnesium Aluminium Silicate, Trideceth-10, Trideceth-3, Salicylic Acid, Limonene, Fumaric Acid, Menthol, Benzyl Alcohol, Benzyl Salicylate, Linalool, Montmorillonite, Amodimethicone, Kaolin, Fragrance,  Carbomer, citric acid, Bht, Hexylene glycol, Hexyl cinnamal, Glycerin.\n\n\n[I'm well aware a question similar to this has been posted by someone else but I didn't see a satisfactory answer and thus I'm posting this]",

        "body": ">Conventional shampoo technology using anionic surfactants and cationic conditioners results in charge interaction and complexing of he ingredients. Neither shampoo nor conditioner achieves the desired result. The successful solution was to incorporate charge neutral dimethicone conditioning ingredients, suspended as microfine droplets within complex crystal lattices, into anionic surfactant shampoo technology. The same solultion has also been applied to amphoteric surfactant systems. This provides complete cleaning, and hair conditioning fully equal to separate conditioners without the problems of build-up. This was achieved by keeping the dimethicone in suspension throughout the shampoo process. During rinsing, excess water breaks the crystalline lattice and allows deposition of the dimethicone droplets onto the hair. Full cleaning and conditioning are, therefore, achieved in one application. Dimethicone build-up is not encountered as subsequent washes first remove soil and previously deposited dimethicone. Neither do neutral dimethicones show any interactions with sebum. \n\n[(Rushton, Gummer & Flasch, 1994)](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/211278)\n\nOne of the authors is affiliated with Proctor and Gamble.\n\nAs to why it doesn't appear to leave build up, the same article states that \"no significant shift compared to untreated hair was found showing that dimethicone does not build-up on the hair surface with continued washing\" and that \"the level of dimethicone deposited onto virgin hair was found to plateau after 5 washes...and remained constant for in excess of 50 washes.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> since shampoo is primarily focused on the scalp does the silicone deposit on it? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure, but I would guess that it might. Silicones are used in skincare though, so I am not sure why that would be a concern:\n\n>The major drawback to pure petrolatum as a moisturizer is its greasiness, which most patients find unaesthetic. This can be minimized by lowering the petrolatum concentration and adding dimethicone, known as an astringent moisturizer,to improve product aesthetics. **Dimethicone is the second most common active agent in moisturizers today** because it too is hypoallergenic, noncomedogenic, and nonacnegenic.4 Dimethicone is one of a family of silicones that form the basis of all oil-free moisturizers and facial foundations......Dimethicone can provide many other skin benefits as an active agent besides moisturization. It can function as an emollient, making the skin smooth and soft to the touch by filling in spaces between the desquamating corneocytes.\n\n(emphasis mine)\n\n[(Draelos, 2010)](https://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/Abstract/2010/02000/Active_Agents_in_Common_Skin_Care_Products.38.aspx)",

    "body": "\nChemovar shredded grape is a 20g tub pre-milled version of their cult classic Daily Grape 🍇 \n\nAt 22% THC this strain is LSO (Living Soil Organic) hang dried and hand trimmed 😍\n\nThe strain is Daily Driver x Grape Pie. It has 2% CBG. I’m finding strains with around this amount of CBG super effective for me. CBG is a minor cannabanoid that plays a role in enhancing pleasure and motivation, regulating appetite and sleep, and alleviating pain 😇\n\nThis strain offers a sativa leaning experience with uplifting and energising effects, and enough mellowing effects to add calm to the equation ☮️ \n\nHighly recommended for patients prone to the raciness and anxiety that some terpinolene dom strains can create - this will give the energising boost without the anxiety/raciness ✌️ \n\nDaily Grape is the result of a long pheno hunt search by Stewart Farms boss babe and grow legend Genevieve Newton 🙏⭐️💃  Who runs the world? We know the answer 👸 \n\nThis shredded option is a brilliant cost effective way to enjoy Daily Grape. There are no stems, this is milled from fresh terpy buds which I can tell because this version is loud and fresh 🤤 \n\nDominant terps are limonene, beta-caryophylene and linalool. Limonene is my favorite most effective anti-depressant strain, making it an effective strain for those treating depression 🧘‍♀️ \n\nUpon opening the tub I was greeted with a sweet gorgeous grape smell that is strong and enticing, with a hint of citrus 🤤 🍇 🍋 \n\nI think it’s so clever of Chemovar to bring out this pre-milled flower. It’s so convenient for those who want the convenience of a pre-milled flower, and it’s a great option for people who have motor or dexterity issues. It’s also at this crazy low price per gram a hugely cost effective way to medicate with Daily Grape for all the OG DG lovers 🌱✅\nPrice is in pics because we can mention pricing here as far as I understand! \n\nYou can see from my pic that it’s fresh, frosty, and really high quality 👏\n\nI’m impressed with the Chemovar new offerings - Bling Blaow, Candy Pave, Facetz and Triangle Chem which has become my number one insomnia strain. I’ve never found a strain that is such a 🔨 😴 but I wake up refreshed, it’s a miracle! Heads up for the insomnia patients 👌\n\nShredded grape is now one of my favorite daily drivers - terpy, delicious and effective at the friendliest price. I much prefer pre-milled craft cannabis from a trusted craft brand like Chemovar rather than buying all the cheap low end options 🥰",

This was my first sunscreen I bought after leaning about photoaging! My first baby! And we were off to a good start. It’s a white watery gel-like texture, light weight, invisible, but quite shiny (some might call this a dewy finish, but I prefer a skin-like finish). A good poster child for the typical Asian sunscreen, I guess. It is not water resistant, and you'll notice this as you sweat throughout the day: It’s like your sweat becomes heavier since it mixes with the sunscreen (you can’t see this of course, but it sure feels like it). I was also worried about touching my face throughout the day, because I felt I might rub the sunscreen off. I can’t remember it ever stinging my eyes, but I’m not entirely sure. The biggest drawback for me was the prize and how inaccessible it is in my country. At this point in time, I also hadn’t learnt about the proper amount of sunscreen you have to use, so I was probably underapplying, and the sunscreen can therefore have appeared lighter-textured in my memory. It contains a lot of fragrance and many ingredients, in general, so that could be irritating. A little bit of science: If you look at the UV filters, there are several UVB filters; many UVB (290-320 wavelength/nm) filters also “bleed into” and filter some UVA II (320-340) as well. The Uvinul A plus filters both UVA II and I (340-400), but it’s also the only UVA filter in this sunscreen, and it’s also the last ranking UV filter on the ingredient list, even though I’ve read that the upper limit for Uvinul A plus is 10% (of the total product). So, is there enough UVA protection? I don’t know, but it’s probably okay since the Pa is four pluses, so I wouldn’t worry too much about it. Packaging is nice and it has a pump, and you get 75 ml, not only the standard 50 ml.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Avène Hydrance OPTIMALE UV RICHE Rich hydrating cream**\n\n* \\- **SPF 20, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **40 ml/1.35 Fl.OZ**\n* \\- **Probably suitable for darker skin tones**\n* \\- **France**\n* \\- **Ingredients:** AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA).

It does not have high enough UV protection, and it is not designed to be used as a sunscreen, and therefore you will end up underapplying. I bought it because I was looking for a day cream at the time. I wanted something for my dry skin and this day cream worked in that regard. But never did I ever apply close to the amount of sunscreen you have to apply to get the labelled SPF and UVA protection. It is on the heavier side, so applying a quarter teaspoon to your face would not feel nice. Trust me. And even then, you’d only get SPF 20. I would not recommend anyone to use this product as a daily SPF product. It also contains fragrance even though it says it’s suitable for sensitive skin.\n* \\- **Score:** 2/5\n\n**NIVEA SUN UV FACE ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS SPF 30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

I must have gone though three of these. It has a lot in common with the MAKE P:REM one, and it also shares some of the same problems. It has a similar texture: white watery-gel, which turns translucent on top of the skin. It’s like a glycerine-rich moisturiser. I think it’s less shiny as well – more skin-like finish. The problem arises when you sweat: your sweat starts feeling even heavier than normal. I think I experienced some eye stinging with this sunscreen (nothing major), largely caused by it not being water resistant. It’s important to note that the reason it is so cosmetically elegant is also why it’s not water resistant. I was also scared to touch my face and accidently rub it off while wearing this one, too. It’s smells like sunscreen. If you’ve ever purchased a NIVEA sunscreen, you’ll know what I mean. And the fragrance doesn’t go away immediately either. My biggest problem at the time, was also that I wanted to find a SPF 50 sunscreen, and this one is only SPF 30. I think I’ve recently seen a SPF 50 version of this since, so if you live in Europe, I guess it’s worth giving it a shot. Looking at the ingredient list now, I see that it contains a lot of avobenzone. Avobenzone has a bad rep, but you cannot deny how effectively it protects against UVA when photostable. Avobenzone on its own is not photostable and will start degrading (and be used up) when exposed to the sun or UV light. In this sunscreen, however, (and most non-American sunscreens) it has been stabilised by another UV filter: In this case by Tinosorb S. I think this sunscreen might have much higher UVA protection than the EU requirement, which makes sense since it’s advertised as “ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS”.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Piz Buin Ultra Light Dry Touch Face Fluid SPF 30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Sweat and water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

This sunscreen survived me walking all around Madrid for a week in the middle of summer. Boom. What a trooper. The texture is a thick liquid, not a cream, so the opening is narrow so you can pour some into your hand or tilt your head backwards and pour it directly on your face. It dries to an almost powdery finish – it truly is dry touch. If you have dry skin, you should probably moisturise beforehand. It was also easy enough to reapply when I was out and about in Madrid; So, layering it wasn’t a chore. If you don’t apply it evenly it might dry down with some flakes even – that’s how dry it is. But I didn’t feel like it dried out my skin in the process, but that is of course a very personal observation. I would have been perfect if it was SPF 50, a little less expensive, and fragrance free. If you’ve ever tried a Piz Buin sunscreen, you’ll recognise their trademark fragrance at once: masculine and sunscreen-like. It does bring back good memories of summer and beaches for me personally, though.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**THE BODY SHOP Vitamin E Day Lotion SPF30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

And it’s not water-resistant, so it will on glide on your face as you sweat. But the absolute worst thing about this is how much it stings your eyes. I could barely open them in broad daylight, and I had to go back home and wash my face to get it off. Do not, under any circumstances apply this close to your eyes. I don’t know what caused it: maybe all the perfume, or the UV filters? Also, the way this product smells, is absolutely abhorrent. Old lady perfume, and it’s so strong.

I have very pale skin (and am therefore really scared of “universal tints”), but it blended perfectly into my skin tone, perhaps with the slightest bit of coverage. Since it’s a mineral sunscreen, I’m sceptical if it’ll blend into darker skin, even with the tint, so that’s something to keep in mind. It might also have photo flashback, you have been warned. Even though it is silicone based, I wouldn’t describe it as “silicone-y”, if you know what I mean; it has a skin like finish. However, I don’t think I ever applied enough of it to truly know what its finish is like… First and foremost: the packaging. When I bought it, they still used a dropper – I repeat a dropper. This did not work, as the product would spill over, clump up at the inner edges of the bottle’s mouth, etc. And since it clumped up at the sides, I honestly don’t know if I’ve lost some of the UV protection of the product, since it’s no longer a completely homogenous liquid. They later changed the dropper to a pump, but it’s still embarrassing that they ever sold it with a dropper. What were they thinking? You also spend quite a bit of time applying it evenly on your skin, due to its consistency and tint. You kind of have to apply it like a foundation. Since it’s only 30 ml, it means that you should be finishing one of these in less than a month – and only if you’re just applying it to your face. At least it doesn’t have any fragrance! It does have an iffy smell to it, which goes away. Taking into consideration the cost, the packaging (even though it has improved) the fact that it’s not a SPF 50, PA++++ product, you’re left with a very mediocre sunscreen. It could however serve as a daily serum on top of your sunscreen, if you’re very extra.\n* \\- **Score:** 3/5\n\n**Altruist Dermatologist Sunscreen SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I had really high expectations for Altruist, same as many others, and I was let down. It isn’t that bad of a sunscreen, but it’s also not that good. At this point in my quest for the Holy grail sunscreen, I realised I had to up my UV game. SPF 30 wasn’t enough, and I wanted as high of an UVA protection as possible. With the EU’s regulation of UVA protection (in a nutshell the UVA protection has to be 1/3 of the SPF), you could, in theory, end up with SPF 30 sunscreens that had higher UVA protection than your SPF 50 sunscreen. And as a consumer, you simply wouldn’t know the difference. Anyway, Altruist SPF 50, has perfect UV protection, and no fragrance and such. In theory it’s the perfect sunscreen. I mean, look at all those filters (seriously why are there so many, did the chemists make a bet or something?) But in practice? Not so much. First and foremost, if you have darker skin, this might leave a white cast due to the titanium dioxide. Some people have mentioned this in their reviews and some people have also mentioned it stinging their eyes (I can’t remember noticing this). Secondly, the reason I didn’t like it, is because of the texture. It’s the same sort of texture as the MAKE P:REM and NIVEA mentioned above, just less cosmetically elegant. I thought it would dry down or sink into my face, but it never did. I would wait for 20 minutes, and I would still be sticky and a little bit shiny. What worked was putting a lot of translucent powder on top, then I would finally achieve a more skin like finish. Pro tip: Translucent powder can actually make most sunscreens bearable. Since it didn’t dry down, I felt as I would rub it off if my face touched anything. Maybe this sunscreen would work for people with dry skin? Since applying this sunscreen, waiting, applying powder, would take such a long time, I ended up just using a different sunscreen. And I guess that says it all. It also has a “chemical” smell to it, but that didn’t bother me. It might not have worked for my face, but it’s still a good sunscreen for the rest of the body.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Skinnies Sungel SPF30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, broad spectrum, PA++++ (PPD 16+)**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

This sunscreen utilises a new technology called Organogel™. It contains no water, and thus it doesn’t have to dry down, and you only need 1/5 the amount of a normal sunscreen. You heard that right: 1/5! So, you only need a pea-sized amount for your entire face! But I used a little bit more than that, because real peas are actually very small, so when people say pea-sized, they usually mean 2-3 real peas. A photo from their website illustrating what they meant by pea-sized confirmed my suspicion. But it’s still a very small amount! The texture is that of a see-through slightly orange-y gel. It’s oily, but it doesn’t move on your skin (also when you sweat). And it’s completely see-though so I can with confidence say it’ll suit every skin tone. It doesn’t completely dry down, though, but it does seem to sink into your skin a little bit, if you wait a couple of minutes. You can feel the gel on your skin when you touch it, but you wouldn’t notice you had anything on otherwise. Since it isn’t water based it also feels sturdier than the others I’ve tried, so I wasn’t as scared of it rubbing off when touching my skin. I think it might work very well as a primer. It has a slight “chemical” smell, it also doesn’t contain any perfume or any nonsense like that. It’s on the pricier side, but one 100ml bottle is actually the equivalent of 500ml of normal sunscreen, when you think about it, so I think the prize is justifiable. This was the sunscreen I kept on using when the Altruist one wasn’t working for me, by the way. It’s definitely the quickest sunscreen to apply of all the sunscreens I’ve ever used. A con is that is a little bit difficult to gauge if you are using enough, and that you’ve applied it evenly. Turns out there are two versions of this sunscreen: An American one and a New Zealand one. I somehow ended up with the American one, and it has worked just fine for me. The NZ version uses non-FDA approved filters, but it still has the same UVB and UVA protection listed, but I would still recommend you buy the NZ version, since there must be a reason why they chose to not just use the same formulation as the American one, right? Since I bought my bottle, they have also released many new products, like an SPF 50+. If the SPF 50+ behaves the same way as this one, I think I might have given it a score of 5/5. But keep in mind that it does not have a dry-touch finish (more of an immovable oily finish), but at least it has a sturdy one.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**The Balm BALMSHELTER TINTED MOISTURIZER (Shade: Lighter Than Light)**\n\n* \\- **SPF 18, broad spectrum**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **64 ml/ 2.15 Fl.

Note that this tinted moisturiser is much lighter than any of The Balm’s other products labelled “Lighter Than Light”. It’s really is a pale shade (it appears darker before you spread it over your skin), and it blends perfectly into my skin: I’ve never seen a tinted moisturiser or BB cream this fair before. However, it is so sheer, that the tint almost doesn’t matter. A little goes a long way, and that’s why you shouldn’t really use BB creams, tinted moisturisers and foundation as UV shields. I intended on using this on top of my sunscreen, but since it has next to none coverage, I never find myself reaching for it. If you’re pale as I am, and you want to experience the novelty of owning a tinted moisturiser, this is a good pick. No fragrance, and I haven’t used it close to my eyes.\n* \\- **Score: 2/5**\n\n**La Roche-Posay ANTHELIOS SHAKA ULTRA-LIGHT SPF 50+**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50+, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), PPD 42**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

This sunscreen was bought in Europe. America/Canada/Australia/Asia might have a different version of this sunscreen, because of the country’s different restrictions on UV filters and sunscreen criteria (especially American sunscreens). These versions are not always equal, both in UV protection and cosmetic elegance. It also turns out that I have bought two versions of this sunscreen: A new and an older version. I actually bought the newest version first – and I loved it. I couldn’t understand how people hated it (the skincare community is very split when it comes to the Shaka fluid). Of course, everyone’s skin is difference and can have a lot to say on how a sunscreen feels and behaves on the skin. It’s a fluid, so you have to shake it thoroughly. It takes a little bit longer to apply, since it’s a fluid. It dries down matte, and you can’t see that you’re wearing anything. Easy peasy. Its biggest downfall is the prize (I bought it on sale) and that it only comes in a tiny 50ml, so you can’t buy it in bulk, so to speak. But this was the newest version (as of this year)… and then I ended up accidently buying the older version online (which might still be in production?), and oh boy, was that a different experience! Not dry-touch, but oily! They looked so similar, but I instantly felt the difference on my face, because it didn’t dry down. Absolutely horrible in comparison, I felt so gross. You can tell the new version from the old from the packaging: The newest version has “ANTI-OXYDANT” written underneath the “UVB + UVA” text. It has a similar texture as the Piz Buin mentioned above, but I personally think the Piz Buin is superior in texture: even more dry-touch. But the shaka outshines almost all sunscreens in terms of UVB and UVA protection, and it doesn’t have any irritating fragrance to boot. I thought this would be my final HG sunscreen, because it couldn’t get any better in terms of UV protection and cosmetic elegance.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5 (new “ANTI-OXYDANT” version, 2019) (old version: 4/5, because it still has great UV protection, okay?)\n\n**EVY TECHNOLOGY SUNSCREEN MOUSSE SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I found it. Perfect texture, high UV protection, and relatively affordable. It also comes in a 100 ml bottle, not a 50 ml, which I appreciate. According to EVY, their sunscreens work differently than other sunscreens, because they don’t lay on top of your skin and form a film, but instead they sink into the skin (stratum corneum, I presume). Because of this, they’re very water resistant and sturdy. You shake the bottle, turn it upside down, and squeeze out a golf ball-sized blob of mousse. (This mousse holds its shape pretty well and you can play with it.) Then I just rub the mousse into my face: first it turns into a light-weight white cream… and then it disappears into the skin. After a couple of minutes, there is no trace of it, but if I’ve applied to much there might be some stickiness. It certainly feels like it sinks into the skin, because it’s very hydrating. The other sunscreens I’ve liked, I’ve liked for their dry-touch finish, but with EVY I don’t need to worry about it, because I can’t feel it on my face when I touch (well, technically my face feels like it’s been hydrated) and it doesn’t do anything when I sweat. A Youtuber reviewed EVY and said that the Boots star system is only marketing – it’s not. While we have a universal measurement of UVB: SPF, we’ve later realised that UVA also causes skin damage and cancer, but we still haven’t been able to agree on one universal measurement or requirement. The Boots Star Rating system with a maximum of 5 stars requires much higher UVA protection than the European Recommendation, where the UVA protection only needs to be 1/3 of the SPF. Gothamista, however, really liked EVY. It has no fragrance, but a light aerosol smell that goes away. Because of the packaging, no preservatives are needed. It also contains some antioxidants. I’m already on my third bottle of EVY, and I will continue to purchase it in the future.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5\n\nSome sunscreens I’ve heard good things about and might want to try one day: Anessa sunscreens, Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50 PA ++++, Ultrasun sunscreens, Bioderma Photoderm Max Cream SPF50+.",

UVA rating so the PPA / PPD factor should be around 27.. which is higher than most SPF50s, I'm sure!

    "body": "Everyone’s talking about the skincare items for May’s Glam Bag X they all look very nice and high end.  Since I have nothing better to do I thought I would do some analyzing of the skincare items, will they actually do anything for your skin? Let’s have a look.  So far I think the ones we’ve all seen are: Herbivore Prism Mask, Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream, Rodial Pink Diamond Cleansing Balm, The Route Party Peel, Kopari CBD Balm.  There may be more skincare items but these are the ones that are confirmed. \n\nThe three most coveted items are easy to see, Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream, Herbivore’s Prism Mask and Rodial Cleansing Balm so I’ll focus my analysis on these 3 items since I happen to own all of them as well. \n\n- Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream RV $100\n\nHas the highest RV and I’m guessing most people are aiming for this, the packaging is gorgeous from the way you unbox the cream to the jar itself, makes a great gift.  Now onto the ingredients:\n\nWater, Homosalate (sunscreen filter), Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ethylhexyl Salicylate (sunscreen filter), Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane (Avobenzone, the only FDA approved sunscreen filter that has sufficient UVA protection, however it’s not stable hence why sunscreens has to be reapplied), Octocrylene (sunscreen filter) Cetyl Alcohol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Steareth-21, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Carbomer, Dimethiconol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Hydrolyzed Viola Tricolor Extract, Allantoin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Disodium Edta, Tocopheryl Acetate, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Sodium Hydroxide, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Michelia Alba Leaf Oil, Sodium Lactate, Coco-Glucoside, PEG-8, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Plumeria Rubra Flower Extract, Ascorbic Acid, Citric Acid, Nicotiana Sylvestris Leaf Cell Culture, Linalool, Citronellol, Geraniol.\n\nI know the label doesn’t mention this but this moisturizer actually has SPF15 and other UVA filters, most of the top ingredients are all sunscreen filters/stabilizers.  The sunscreen filters that are in the moisturizer are mostly weak ones or are in low concentration like Avobenzone, so this wouldn’t be my sunscreen pick for going out in the sun.  \n\nThen there are the usual occlusive ingredients like silicones and other ingredients which will give the skin a silky smooth finish, of course having Shea Butter gives it a more thicker texture, most of the ingredients that can’t be pronounced are common preservatives/emulsifiers (ingredients that help water and oil mix properly so they don’t separate)/ingredients that help stabilize the formula, most of these ingredients are in normal moisturizers, you won’t find some of them in most “clean beauty” products, however there’s nothing unsafe/toxic about these ingredients which have been in cosmetics for a long time.  \n\nIn terms of beneficial ingredients for the skin, it’s got the common humectants like glycerin, dimethicone, butylene glycol, hyaluronic acid, aloe vera, that attract and hold onto moisture.  Besides the oat kernel extract and Shea butter most of the other ingredients like rose hip oil, cameilla seed oil, sunflower seed oil, etc aren’t in high enough concentrations for the skin to derive any nutrients from them but they accomplish the task of softening the skin.  The BioNymph peptide that’s talked about the description of the cream is “Nicotiana Sylvestris Leaf Cell Culture”, fairly new ingredient it’s a natural peptide, can’t find any studies on it besides the ones coming from the manufacturer.  Obviously those studies show it’s magic protects the skin against anything oh and it also diminishes wrinkles in 2 weeks....sure.  \n\nFinal thoughts on the product: I bought it because of the hype and nice packaging, it does accomplish what a moisturizer is suppose to do, trap and prevent the loss of moisture, most people expect too much from their moisturizers IMO and that’s why companies are creating ridiculous ingredients like bioNymph peptide in order to look special.  I think this moisturizer was originally suppose to be a makeup primer with higher SPF protection but they couldn’t stabilize the Avobenzone, cos it’s a very tricky sunscreen filter and also the ingredients at the top all seem to be suggest this would be a more lightweight product in terms of texture.  The last part of the cream with all the thickening and beneficial ingredients for skin almost came as an after thought.  It’s fairly scented, the last 3 ingredients are all fragrance, but I don’t mind scented products and enjoy the way this smells.  It’s not as heavy as most of my other moisturizers since I have dry skin and like super thick creams. Most people will likely use this at night but I wonder if it’s okay to sleep with sunscreen filters....\n\n- Herbivore Prism Mask RV $58\n\nIngredients list: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit/Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Salix Nigra (Willow) Bark Extract, leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Populus Tremuloides Bark Extract, Gluconolactone, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Sodium Phytate.\n\nMy analysis copied from a reply:\n\n“I have the Herbivore Prism Mask and Serum I bought both when I was still a newbie when it came to skincare ingredients/formulation.  Now that I’ve had to learn more about skincare cos of the constant crap we receive in beauty boxes, I would not recommend the Prism Mask. It uses “natural AHAs” we’ve all seen it before in other products like sugar cane extract, sugar maple extract (maple syrup, very Canadian), lemon extract etc. MANY of these “clean beauty brands” will treat these fruit extracts the same as glycolic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, etc. However they’re completely DIFFERENT!\n\nYes most AHAs are derived from fruit extracts like glycolic acid comes from sugar cane, tartaric and malic comes from maple syrup extract etc, however these acids has to be derived in a lab first, on it’s own these extracts has no PROVEN exfoliation abilities.  Maybe there’s a tiny bit of exfoliating action but because AHAs acids needs to be at the right pH level to work anywhere from pH of 2 to just under 4, from looking at the ingredients of the Prism Mask it’s definitely passed that pH (just a guess, maybe I’ll test the pH later). The closer an AHA exfoliating product gets to the pH of 2, the more free acid value it has. As an example everyone’s favourite lactic acid treatment Sunday Riley GG has only 5% concentration of lactic acid and yet why is it so effective and be loved? It’s because the pH of GG is just around 2.5ish (I tested it with pH strips and got values between 2 and 3 so I’ll just avg it out), at that pH level it can access almost all 5% of the lactic acid in the formula. As another example a product like Saturday Skin’s 10% Glycolic Acid Toner at first looks very promising but when tested the the pH level was between 5-6, making the 10% claim useless since acids can’t do much exfoliating at those pH levels, and the toner can’t access the 10% of glycolic acid and use it properly, making the free acid value basically zero.  When it comes to exfoliating products the percentage of acids doesn’t mean much, it’s all about the pH level and free acid value, if you look at Skinceutical’s Glycolic Overnight Cream on the packaging it doesn’t say this cream contains 10% glycolic acid but rather the free acid value is 10% glycolic.  \n\nAs for the 5% BHA claim, again it uses willow bark extract cos it’s a “clean natural” ingredient, Willow Bark extract contains salicin which only becomes salicylic acid when it’s orally ingested cos of the enzymes in our stomachs, I’m assuming no one wants to eat this mask. Salicylic acid is derived from willow bark extract in labs using a complicated process, thus when applied topically willow bark extract is actually a very good ingredient for inflammation, it soothes the skin, helps with redness etc. It’s good for the skin just not for exfoliating. Lastly the law prohibits any OTC product from having more than 2% salicylic acid (BHA), so these brands get around this by putting 5% BHA on the label hoping people will think 5% willow bark extract is the same as 5% salicylic acid, obviously they’re two completely different ingredients. It’s actually a very good hydrating mask though.”\n\nAlso forget to mention this has zero preservatives not even the new ones that are supposedly so much safer and not toxic, I guess the antibacterial properties of leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate can assist in preserving the product however I’m not a big fan of mold and bacteria so if you do receive this please make sure to check the batch code and when it was manufactured \n\n- Rodial Pink Diamond Cleansing Balm RV $59\n\nIngredients list: Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG-8 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Cetearyl Alcohol, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Germ Oil, Polysorbate 20, Glyceryl Dibehenate, Tribehenin, Glyceryl Behenate, Parfum (Fragrance), Tocopherol , Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Mica, Diamond Powder, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Geraniol, Limonene, Linalool, CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide), CI 75470 (Carmine)\n\nIt’s not really a balm texture, if you’re use to using those K beauty cleansing balms with the sherbet texture or the Farmacy one that will transform from balm/oil to milky emulsion this is different.  When it comes out of the tube it has a oil in gel texture, it removes all my makeup but I don’t wear heavy or waterproof makeup.  It’s heavily scented so maybe not the best for sensitive skin.  It washes off cleanly and comes with a muslin cloth, honestly there’s not too much to say about a cleanser.  I bought it cos I’m a sucker for pretty packaging, it’s nice that it’s in a tube so good for traveling/weekend trips, again the main draw back is the fragrance.\n\nTL:DR - they all make great gifts, as far as skincare benefits....meh.",

    "body": "***Author's Note: This is a bit of a departure from my usual style of reviewing because I happen to have nearly the entire formula for the perfume in question in my possession. As such, I discuss the component materials rather more than usual, and hope that you will forgive the technical nature of the language for the sake of a more complete frame of reference.***\n\nPerhaps one of my favorite things about perfume is that there seems to be no limit to the wonders produced by its practitioners, be they self-taught chemistry nerds and artists or fully-trained masters. The development of Hermés’ elegant olfactory illusion [*Un Jardin sur le Nil*](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Herm-s/Un-Jardin-Sur-Le-Nil-18.html) (A Garden on the Nile) is indicative of this wondrous nature, so much so that Chandler Burr famously structured part of his book “The Perfect Scent” around its creation.\n\nBefore getting to the fragrance itself, I feel it helpful to share its entire formula, displayed below.\n\nMaterial | Percentage\n---|---\nAllyl Amyl Glycolate (10% Dilution) | 0.40%\nAmbrettolide | 1.10%\nBergamot Oil (Italy) | 3.00%\nCardamom Oil (Guatemala)| 0.30%\nL-Carvone (10% Dilution)| 0.10%\nCassis Base 345B | 9.10% (This is the real essence of the mango accord)\nCis-3-Hexenol (10% Dilution)| 1.30%\nCis-3-Hexenyl Acetate (10% Dilution)  | 0.40%\nDamascone Beta (10%  Dilution)| 0.50%\nDimethyl Benzyl Carbinyl Butyrate | 0.30%\nDipropylene Glycol (Used to dilute materials at 10%) | 18.50%\nEthyl Acetoacetate | 0.90%\nEthylene Brassylate | 30.40%\nFleur D' Oranger F175SAB | 0.20%\nGeraniol | 0.50%\nGeranium Bourbon Oil | 0.40%\nGeranyl Acetone (10% Dilution) | 0.40%\nEllena's Propriatary Grapefruit Accord (Rhubofix and Bitter Orange Oil) | 0.50%\nHedione High-Cis | 8.90%\nHelional | 0.90%\nß-Ionone | 1.00%\nLemon Oil (Italy) | 0.90%\nLinalool | 1.30%\nLinalyl Acetate | 1.20%\nMagnolan | 3.30%\nMethyl Pamplemousse | 0.50%\nEvernyl/Veramoss | 0.20%\nNerolidol | 5.60%\nPhenoxyethyl Isobutyrate | 0.30%\nPhenethyl Alcohol | 2.00%\nReseda Body/Reseda Acetal (10% Dilution) (IFF Hyacinth/Sweet Pea/Bean Base) | 0.10%\nSandal Hexenol | 5.30%\nTuberose Base | 0.20%\n\nEven looking at the thing as written, and having made it several times, I still can’t believe that it smells as it does. It’s remarkable.\n\nCommissioned in the mid-90s from famed French perfumer Jean-Claude Ellena by the luxury leather house Hermés, *Un Jardin sur le Nil* smells, at least primarily, of green mangoes. You may note from the formula listed above that there are no actual mango materials LISTED, which is part of its genius.\n\nIt opens with mango. Not the sweet, ripe, candy-like mango you’re probably thinking of, but a tangy, green, sharpened mango, like one freshly picked from the tree. Achieved through the use of considerable quantities of citrus (primarily grapefruit), black currant, tomato, and carrot, the green mango accord is perhaps one of the loveliest, cleverest tricks in perfume, and is a beautiful example of Ellena’s renowned “transparent” style. He pioneered the idea of creating “mosaic-like” perfumes, where the overall picture is only apparent from afar, but the individual, component notes can be recognized if you focus on them.\n\nBeneath the green, acidic sweetness of the mango and grapefruit are various fantasy florals, listed by the house as bullrush and lotus blossom, but created with the use of helional, hedione (seen here in its high-cis-isomer configuration), magnolan, phenethyl alcohol, and nerolidol. These synthetic materials are extremely common in perfumery and are often called into service to represent various floral modifications to some major central accord. Even the mangoes in the US have pronounced floral characteristics before they’re cut or peeled, and Ellena’s attention to detail in adding floral facets to the accord is both impressive and inspiring.\n\nBeyond this point, the design becomes more indistinct, and many of the notes listed are not recognizable. Indeed, as it progresses, *Un Jardin sur le Nil* becomes whispier and more fleeting, owing in part to its weirdly pronounced lack of fixative materials. But the fuzzy nature of the perfume’s base does not detract at all from the sparkling brilliance of its opening hours, and from the lush, verdant olfactory landscape created for the wearer. Here is a perfume of watercolors made smell, all penciled-outlines and painted wood pulp, beautiful in its airy abstraction. For all that it may lack in longevity or the dense, floral gravitas of Golden Age perfumes, *Un Jardin sur le Nil* is a look into a world at once familiar and exotic, easily approachable and thoroughly bewildering. I smile every time I wear it.",

Lips are an extension of the throat and if you tend to often lick your lips subconsciously, it is your body's indication that it needs more water. Take my advice, I don't listen to it anyway. It is not easy to increase your water intake overnight. I struggle with drinking an adequate amount of water. A good lip product is my saviour from Sahara lips.\n\nI am ranking these lip products in order of preference.\n\n***1. Bakson's Sunny Lip Balm - ₹40***\n\nThank you @ for introducing me to this small wonder.\n\nDon't be misguided by the packaging. This lip balm is much more than your basic vaseline; It's the vaseline killer. This inexpensive lip balm provides the ideal balance of moisturisation, emollience and occlusiveness. The ingredient list is stellar. This lip balm does not just sit on my lips and lock moisture, but it also conditions my lips. It glides on my lips in a thin layer and you can immediately feel it emollize my lips. It keeps my lips hydrated for longer. I definitely need to reapply during the day but it provides immediate comfort to dry and cracked lips. Within 2-3 days of religious use, my lips are completely healed. This is the perfect lip balm to throw - in your bathroom, car, pocket, bag, and at your *'Sun yaar lip balm denaa?'* friends.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Petrolatum, Lanolin Anhydrous, Shea Butter, Souabran Glycerides, Bees Wax, Almond Oil, Vitamin E, Distillates of Aloe vera & Calendula, B.H.T., Sorbic Acid, Perfume.*\n\nAdditional tip: Lanolin makes for a great nipple balm. It is prescribed to pregnant & lactating mothers. If you suffer from dry nipples, you can use this lip balm to perk 'em up to life.\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WRP**\n\n***2. Unpa Bubi Bubi Lip Ampule - $6***\n\nIt would be on the top of my list had its competitor not been 1/10th of its price. Its name can certainly raise eyebrows, but this one packs a punch. I was pleasantly surprised by this random buy. The texture is like honey, but it is not at all sticky or goopy. It is very comfortable to apply during the day or at night. It goes on in a thin layer and adheres well to your lips. It does not just stay put and form an occlusive barrier, but a part of it descends into my lips and makes my lips moisturised & naturally plump. It helps deeply condition my lips, repairing flaky and dry skin. I had recently cut my lip, and this one helped to repair my lips overnight. I feel I do not need to reapply during the day, and it keeps my lips hydrated through the night as well. Love the tube packaging. A little goes a long way with this one, and it truly gives me baby lips. I want to repurchase this again.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Diisostearyl Malate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Castor Oil Isostearate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Microcrystalline Wax, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Dehydroacetic Acid, Ceramide NP, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Water, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hyaluronic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter*\n\n**Rating: 4.5/5, WRP**\n\n***3.  Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula - with SPF 15 - Dark Chocolate & Mint ₹130***\n\nThis lip balm has the perfect shape for a lip balm in a stick & the texture is like that of a stick of butter. It does not have the typically waxy feeling. It is highly emollient and moisturising. SPF is an added benefit as lips also need sun protection to protect from ageing, especially if you are heading outside in the sun. Perfect for throwing in your purse. The smell and flavour are surprisingly nice. Ideal for all mint chocolate lovers out there. Even though it has some chemical filters, it doesn't have an unpleasant smell or aftertaste. I feel the need to reapply during the day, but it is an enjoyable feeling due to flavour and scent. Overall I quite enjoyed this lip balm. I will repurchase.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Dimethicone 1.5%, Octinoxate 7.5%, Oxybenzone 4.5%. Inactive ingredients: mineral oil (paraffinum liquidum), microcrystalline wax (cera microcristallina ), copernicia cerifera (carnauba) wax, theobroma cacao (cocoa) seed butter, fragrance (parfum), tocopherol, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, isopropyl myristate, beta carotenex0003(CI 40800), zea mays (corn) oil, benzyl alcohol.*\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WRP**\n\n***4. The Body Shop Strawberry Lip Balm ₹250***\n\nThis used to be one of my favourite lip balms before I tried the ones above it. There is a theme here. This lip balm too adds emollience to your lips. The artificial strawberry flavour and the smell are intense and quite enjoyable in my 15-year-old brain. This lip balm has been intended for your partner to enjoy. I'm not too fond of the pot packaging, but there is enough product here to last you months. The flavours are interesting and mood uplifting. Overall it is a nice lip balm but I won't be repurchasing it because I can get something similar in a better packaging for 1/5th the price.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Ricinus Communis Seed Oil, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax, Lanolin, Parfum, Cera Alba, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Silica \\[NANO\\], Tocopheryl Acetate, Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Ammonium Glycyrrhizate, Aroma, Fragaria Vesca Fruit Extract, Tocopherol, Benzyl Benzoate, BHT, CI 15850, CI 15850.*\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WNRP**\n\n***5. Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask - Choco Mint ₹1150***\n\nThis popular pick used to be my holy grail lip mask two years ago. This innovative product was one of the first of its descent and ahead of its time. Its thick and goopy texture catches eyeballs. This is my second tub of this product, and if you have tried one of these you know, this lasts a lifetime. Sadly, this queen has been dethroned by Bubi Bubi Lip Ampule. I do not find myself reaching for it anymore. My relationship with this product was like a young romance. I went in starry-eyed and fell fast for the bling, but now I find myself looking for more material suitors. The texture of this is very thick & goopy, but my issue with the product is that it never truly sinks in. It stays sticky, thick and wet on your lips and once you remove it (because it won't sink in), your lips won't feel much different than when you first put it on. The feeling on your lips is not particularly pleasant. This is why you cannot use it in the day. It is a good sleeping mask for the night if you put something underneath it as works well for locking in moisture. If you are curious to try this, I recommend getting a smaller sample size as that would last you 6 months and be more pocket friendly. The mint flavour quite nice and not overpowering. The tingle is not intense. I will not be repurchasing this.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Diisostearyl Malate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytosteryl/Isostearyl/Cetyl/Stearyl/Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax/Cera Microcristallina/Cire Microcristalline, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Synthetic Wax, Ethylene/Propylene/Styrene Copolymer, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Mica, Butylene/Ethylene/Styrene Copolymer, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax/Candelilla Cera Hydrocarbons/Cire De Candelilla, Candelilla Wax Esters, Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax/Copernicia Cerifera Cera/Cire De Carnauba, Dehydroacetic Acid, Methicone, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Blue 1 Lake (Ci 42090), Limonene, Yellow 10 Lake (Ci 47005), Water/Aqua/Eau, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Linalool, Potassium Alginate, Glycerin, Propanediol, BHT, Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Sapindus Mukorossi Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Chamaemorus Seed Extract, Chenopodium Quinoa Seed Extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Beta-Glucan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Disodium Edta, Ascorbyl Glucoside*\n\n***Rating: 3/5, WNRP***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***RiRe Bubble Bubble Mask: - Bubbling mask that does nothing.

    "body": "If, like me, you consider perfumery to be an artform, you may well reach a point where you decide to ‘peek behind the magician’s curtain’ and try your hand at learning how to make a fragrance yourself.\n\nThe problem, however, is that whilst there is a considerable amount of information available on the internet, much of this is nebulous, and there doesn’t seem (at least in my view!) to be a defined gateway through which one can start to learn how to become a home perfumer. Indeed, as artforms go, it’s perhaps the most difficult to convey knowledge on - firstly because much of the industry is secretive in nature and, secondly, because you can’t smell through a computer screen.\n\nNevertheless, a market for online education in perfumery does exist and this is now, naturally, being filled by a range of competing products. The cost of these can range anywhere from a couple of hundred pounds to thousands, so it can be difficult to know what represents value for money. In light of that, I thought I’d describe my own experience below having undertaken Experimental Perfume Club’s (EPC) full academy course.\n\nThe TL;DR of this review is that I’ve found the course exceptionally helpful and of value to me, but I think it’s worth discussing both the positives and negatives of it.\n\n**Who are Experimental Perfume Club and what do they offer?**\n\nEPC are a perfumery based in London who also offer perfume creation experiences and an ‘academy’ to members of the public. They were founded by Emmanuelle Moeglin, who also presents the course material. Emmanuelle is a trained chemist and perfumer with a number of years experience working in the industry for various companies (including Puig, Loreal, Symrise and Takasogo).  \n  \nAside from what I imagine are more ‘beginner’ day experiences at their Covent Garden store, EPC offer a three module online perfumery course, which is taught through videos, alongside written course materials.\n\nThe modules can either be purchased individually - £850 for the first and £550 for the next two respectively - or can be purchased together for £1,950, in which case you’ll also get a hardback ‘handbook’ which provides information on each of the individual ingredients included with your purchase.\n\nAs I purchased the £1,950 set, my review will focus solely on my own personal experience with this.\n\n**What do you get, specifically, for £1,950?**\n\nBefore we go anywhere, I think we need to appreciate that £1,950 is a significant sum of money. I wouldn’t consider myself to be poor by any stretch of the imagination, but that is a serious amount of cash (and I actually purchased it using a 0% credit card to pay it back over a number of months!). So what do you get? Well, in short:  \n\n\n* Over 90 ingredients in labelled bottles weighing 10g each, including a range of naturals and synthetics, the vast majority of which are diluted in alcohol to 10% (and, in the case of very strong materials, 1%), alongside a very small number of pure undiluted ingredients. These are organised within a ‘perfumer’s organ’.\n* Over 14 hours of tutorial videos\n* ‘Lab equipment’ including a set of scales, pipettes, scent strips, empty bottles, and a few small perfume bottles for your final products.\n* A perfumers ‘handbook’ which discusses the ingredients provided.\n* A board/tray to work within.\n* Downloadable workbooks and presentations, which include accord formulas (most of which form a direct part of the course).\n* An exam for each module, for which you can print yourself a certificate!.\n* Access to an online Facebook group so you can discuss the course with other students/an online shop where you can order replacement materials (diluted to the same strengths as those provided).\n\n**The Presentation**\n\nCredit where credit is due - EPC have really put effort into the presentation of this course. Upon unboxing, I was actually taken aback at how well put together the set is. Each element of the course has its own open-out perfumer’s organ (four in total), and the four closed organs sit neatly within the work tray (forming a cube), whilst the handbook fits in a specifically spaced slot underneath the tray. I’m a lover of architecture (yes, I am a man of niche interests…!), and immediately felt charmed by the ‘brutalist’ quality of the design. It was reassuring to know that both time and care had clearly gone in to producing it.\n\n**The Course**\n\nAs described above, the course is made up of around 14 hours of videos which are accessed through the EPC website. You have to undertake the videos in order, and you can’t advance to the next until you’ve fully watched the previous one. The videos, which can range from just over 2 minutes to over 30 minutes are almost all presented by Emmanuelle Moeglin herself, either direct to camera or, very occasionally, with her speaking over PowerPoint slides.\n\nThe most important elements of the course (and, in my opinion, what you’re really paying for) are the ingredient smelling sections though, and EPC really come into their own here. Each ingredient has a number on the cap, and students are encouraged not to read the ingredient label itself, but to simply dip a scent strip in the solution and to then describe the smell. This reviewing is undertaken in ‘batches’ throughout the course and, once notes for each ingredient have been made, the presenters then provide their own insights on them. As someone who had never smelt Linalool in isolation, for example, being provided with the opportunity to do so, and then to have professionals discuss its qualities was fantastic.\n\nMost of the ingredients are provided in ‘sets’ that go together to form accords, and the course then goes on to discuss how these are formulated. Students will, for example, by asked to create a rose accord utilising materials from the course once they’ve understood how each one operates individually.\n\nFinally, once you’ve undertaken all the work for each module, there’s a multiple choice exam to pass. Those who fear exams can relax, however, as this is marked automatically and can be retaken as many times as necessary.  \n  \n**Observations, Pros, and Cons**\n\nMy honest opinion, having now completed all three modules of the course is that it is excellent and, as such, the paragraphs below which may come across as critical should be seen in this context. I have thoroughly enjoyed doing it and, most crucially, I now feel more confident and inspired to actually continue on my ‘fragrance journey’. Learning about the different ingredients that go into making our favourite scents has been a joy, and EPC can be rightly proud of what they’ve put together.\n\n* It’s evident from the first video that Ms. Moeglin is an excellent presenter, and I found it very easy to learn the course content. In fact, if I’m being super critical, information within the course was sometimes unnecessarily restated purely, I suspect, because Emmanuelle wanted to make sure it had been taken onboard. The upshot of this is that not all of the 14 hours of content are *wholly* unique.\n* The first module, in particularly, is aimed at giving beginners enough knowledge to create a basic perfume for personal enjoyment. This is understandable, but it can also lead to concepts being simplified in a way that isn’t necessarily beneficial later on. As stated above, for example, all the materials in the course are diluted to at least 10% for ease. The downside of this, however, is that it also means the maximum strength of any perfume you can make is, of course, 10% (i.e a mid-strength EdT).\n* More importantly though, the vast majority of perfumers would not actually make a perfume using prediluted versions of ingredients (unless the ingredient is exceptionally potent), so creating a perfume using these is atypical. Whilst this is noted by EPC, it’s not really until the third module where it is tackled in particular detail.\n* Similarly, students are initially encouraged to weigh their formulas out of one hundred, but the industry (and places like the Basenotes forum where you might want to try accords etc) will almost always use one thousand (i.e. how many grams of the ingredient there would be in 1kg of undiluted product). I would have, personally, found it useful for the reasoning for this to be explained in full in the first module, even if it was acknowledged that we’d be playing with ‘simplified rules’.\n* This being said, there are obvious positives to pre-diluting ingredients. It wouldn’t be fun, after all, for a course to begin with you being told that you would need to dilute 90 bottles of liquid in ethanol yourself before you could even start to smell them (and you really do need to do this, as you can’t reasonably smell ingredients in their pure form)! This isn’t Karate Kid.\n* On that subject, some readers might very well question if procuring these ingredients through the course represents value for money. Pell Wall (a UK ingredient supplier), for instance, will sell you 10g of Hedione for £5. Suederal, meanwhile, can be had for £6 (and so on). Whilst some ingredients are pricier than these, I wouldn’t imagine that the total value of them would come to more than £900, and you’d also get 10 times the amount if you bought them all. At the same time though, you’d then have to pre-dilute all of them yourself, using an additional 90 bottles, and you’d also then be stuck with a considerable amount of pure ingredients which may have a limited shelf life prior to dilution (and which you may never even want to use). Personally, I’d rather pay the extra for the course materials, and actually learn how each of them smells properly than fumble around in the dark trying to teach myself.\n* I did, however, make some additional purchases shortly after starting the course. The biggest one was a proper set of scales. Unfortunately, the set provided with the course were very temperamental and would sometimes not register material being added, making it impossible to undertake the creation of accords etc. Hopefully I just got unlucky with a faulty set. Even if they had worked though, I still felt that they weren’t necessarily high quality, so I shelled out for a more precise set on the side. Believe it or not, this is my biggest criticism with the course.\n* I also ended up purchasing a lot more scent strips, pipettes, and bottles. This is because, whilst the set does come with a reasonable amount, you’re actively encouraged to re-smell ingredients regularly to train your nose, as well as to reformulate your accords. That requires new strips, pipettes and bottles each time if you don’t want to contaminate materials. I don’t consider that outlay to be unreasonable though. One of the two bottles of Hedione supplied in the set was also dodgy - luckily it wasn’t the first bottle I smelt! I’m assuming that was just an unfortunate one off.\n* The course doesn’t really focus too heavily on the chemistry side of the artform. This is understandable in some ways, but I actually find the science fascinating, and some further exploration of this element would be great for us nerds.\n* The course does not cover a huge number of accords/bases (probably quality over quantity!) - it would have been nice if reference were made to things like the grojsman accord though, just so that students could understand them and potentially experiment with them, or if famous perfume formulas were discussed in depth.\n* The ‘handbook’ is nice to have and flick through, but isn’t immensely detailed on each ingredient. As I’ve now learned them, I don’t feel a particular need to refer to it.\n* The exams can be frustrating! They’re a selection of multiple choice questions, where you can sometimes choose more than one answer, but I often found the wording to be confusing. Basically, anything that was a technical question, I was fine with, whilst anything that was a bit more flowery in description had a tendency to leave me getting marked down. But, hey, I passed…!\n* The Facebook group seems under-utilised at the moment. There’s the odd post on there, but it’d be nice to see more discussion.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIf you want to learn about perfume ingredients, and gain confidence in *how to* learn and develop moving forwards, this is the course for you. The only issue is the price, really. If you can afford the entry fee, I can heartily recommend it.",

It seems like the natural progression for fragrance influencers these days is to release a line of perfumes before pivoting to selling online courses and perfumer's materials. No doubt it's way more profitable and less work, once they've built a reputation for themselves...\n\nIn my view, as long as the focus of a perfume course is on how to make fragrance as a hobby, and you have the fun money to do it, by all means. There are more expensive hobbies. Anytime I get a whiff of \"starting a fragrance business\" in these courses I start to get skeptical of the value they offer the average person -and if you're wealthy enough to be starting a perfume company, you're taking private courses or hiring outside perfumers to do the lab work for you.",

    "body": "A few months ago, I taught an in-person class called Demystifying Aromachemicals for fragrance aficionados and aspiring perfumers who wanted to learn more about the world of fragrance ingredients outside of natural oils.   It was a hands-on class and everybody walked home with a hundred pipettes, a dozen empty bottles, some perfumers alcohol and half an ounce of all the materials described here.  \n\nThis was the I handout I wrote up for the class.  I figured that some of the folks here might find it interesting.\n\n\n**Demystifying Aromachemicals**\n\n**PART 1**\n\nAromachemical is a catch-all term that describes the fragrant materials used in perfumery. Some fragrant materials are made up of a single type of molecule, like linalool or phenyl ethyl alcohol. Some are a blend of many different molecules, such as lavender essential oil or Givaudan’s Ultrazur base.\nDifferent ingredient types\n\n* Essential oils – steam distilled oils that come from plants. Typically\nessential oils are a blend of dozens or hundreds of aromachemicals. Not all oils can be extracted well through steam distillation though. Sometimes the high heat breaks down some of the oils. Sometimes oils don’t actually extract well with steam. Rose and Jasmine are examples of oils that don’t react well to steam distillation. Rose oil isn’t extracted fully. Jasmine has ingredients that don’t react well to the heat. ~~In the case of rose, sometimes steam distillation is used to partially extract the oils and solvent is used to extract the rest. When the steam distilled and solvent extracted ingredients are combined back together, this gives you a rose otto.~~ In the case of rose, the steam distillation process is more complicated. The oil from the rose petals is distilled and then the water used during the distillation needs to have the phenyl ethyl alcohol extracted from it and blended back into the oil extracted in the previous step. This is called rose otto.\n* Absolute oils – solvent extracted oils that come from plants. Usually hexane is used as the solvent. This typically gives stronger, richer oils than steam extraction. Typically absolute oils are a blend of dozens or hundreds of aromachemicals.\n* CO2/SCO2 extracts – solvent extracted oils that come from plants. In this case, carbon dioxide is cooled until it becomes a semi-liquid slush and that is used to extract the material. Many people believe that this gives the purest smell. Typically CO2/SCO2 extracts are a blend of dozens or hundreds of aromachemicals.\n* Concretes – solvent extracts that come out as a solid or semi-solid wax. Orris butter is an example of this. Typically concretes are a blend of dozens or hundreds of aromachemicals.\n* Resins – solid fragrance materials that come from plants. Benzoin, frankincense tears and myrrh gum are examples of resins. Typically resins are a blend of dozens or hundreds of aromachemicals\n* Tincture – fragrant liquid made by soaking an ingredient in alcohol for a long period of time to extract the oils\n* Individual molecules – solid or liquid materials that are made from a single molecule. There may be multiple isomers of the same molecule in the ingredient. Limonene, phenyl ethyl alcohol, calone, ambroxan and galaxolide are examples of this.\n** Isomers – The same collection of atoms put together in a slightly different way. Different isomers can smell very similarly to each other or very differently. Some isomers are just mirror images of each other. Some are constructed slightly differently. Some have a part that’s twisted. D-[molecule name] and L-[molecule name] are mirror images of each other. Cis and Trans refer to how they’re twisted. Typically the “cis” versions of a molecule are both more unstable and more valuable in perfumery than the trans variants. Alpha, Beta and Gamma also refer to different isomers. Iso E Super, Iso Gamma Super, Timbersilk and Sylvamber are all trade names for the ingredients with the same assortment of isomers, just in different ratios.\n** Isolates – Single molecule ingredients that have been extracted from a natural oil. One might find linalool extracted from mint, or eugenol extracted from clove for example.\n* Captive molecules – Patented molecules that were created by one of the big oil houses that are not generally available for sale. Paradisone (which is basically hedione with a very high ratio of cis molecules) and Georgywood (which is very close in smell to the very desirable gamma isomer of Iso E Super) are examples of captive molecules.\n* Fragrance oils- A blend of ingredients. Those ingredients are not disclosed. They could be natural, lab created, or mix thereof. There is no way to tell. Avoid using fragrance oils because they could change or disappear at any time, leaving you high and dry\n* Bases – These are blends that have been put out by one of the big oil companies. They are basically fragrance oils, but with a guarantee of consistency and availability. Even when one oil house goes out of business, others buy the formulas and continue to provide the bases. Bases from a century ago from companies long expired are still available by special order if you know who to ask.\n* Key accords – This is a term that Perfumer’s Apprentice uses for bases based upon published example formulas from big oil houses. The formula is available, but you can also purchase the finished base for the\nsake of convenience. Key accords vary in quality because they were designed to highlight a particular ingredient that the oil house is trying to sell rather than trying to smell perfectly natural.\n\n\n**Additional resources**\n\n* The Good Scents Company maintains an incredible database of information on thousands of ingredients, in a level of detail that is astonishing. Do a google search for “good scents [ingredient name]” to find the page or go to http://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/search2.html\n* The Good Scents Company also maintains a comprehensive list of demo formulas (like the key accords). http://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/demos/dm1015272.html\n* The Perfumer’s Apprentice publishes all of their key accord formulas here: http://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/perfumersworkshop/formulas/key_ accords/\n\n**Sourcing aromachemicals**\n\n\nYou can’t buy aromachemicals directly from the big oil houses unless you’re buying by the 55 gallon drum. Some of the big oil houses are:\n\n* Givaudan\n* Firmenich\n* International Flavors and Fragrances (IFF)\n* Symrise\n* Takasago\n* Robertet\n\nMany of the most famous perfumers also work directly for these companies and are contracted out.\n\nIf you’re buying in quantities of less that 1 kg, you’re looking at buying from sources like these:\n\n* The Perfumer’s Apprentice – http://shop.perfumersapprentice.com - Small volumes of hundreds of aromachemicals available. Based in Scott’s Valley (near Santa Cruz). USPS shipping to the Bay Area is often overnight. The materials for this class mostly came from the Perfumer’s Apprentice.\n* Creating Perfume - http://www.creatingperfume.com - Small volumes of hundreds of aromachemicals available. They carry many ingredients that the Perfumer’s Apprentice doesn’t and also carry perfumer’s alcohol. Based in San Leandro. They provided some additional materials for this class.\n* Perfumer Supply House - http://perfumersupplyhouse.com - Another small volume reseller, based on the east coast which carries some items the other two don’t.\n\nThere’s another middle level of purchasing, where you have a business license and you’re buying by the kg, but not by the drum. Vigon International and the John D Walsh Company are examples of such sources.\n\nEconomies of scale are huge in aromachemicals. Hedione is $800/kg when you’re buying it 4 ml at a time. It’s $100 kg when you buy it by the kg. It’s $12/kg when you buy 200 kg at once. It’s even cheaper by the 55 gallon drum. Most artisan perfumers are paying 50-100x the prices for raw materials that LVMH and Estee Lauder are.\n\n**Creating a Modern Accord: The Grojsman Accord**\n\nSophia Grojsman created this modern accord which can be found (with some variations) in a huge number of modern women’s fragrances. Lancome Tresor consists mostly (80%) of this accord.\n\n* Methyl Ionone gamma 85% (Isoraldeine 95) – 5\n* Iso E super – 5\n* Hedione 5\n* Galaxolide 50% - 10\n\nDilute the result to 20% concentration by adding 75 drops of alcohol (the Galaxolide is already diluted and we’re taking that into account.\n\nOPTIONAL: Add 10 drops of ambroxan as well.  Many modified Grojsman accords include ambroxan.\n\nOPTIONAL: Remake the same formula with Timbesilk instead of Iso E Super.\n\nOPTIONAL: Add a drop of damascone beta to get a very modern smelling accord.\n  \n**PART 2**\n\n**Olfactory Fatigue**\n\nSmell Memory: Your nose is a limited resource. Perfumers do their best to limit the number of sniffs that they give a material to avoid olfactory fatigue. Practice smelling materials with a single sniff and holding on to the memory of them. After 15-30 seconds, go back and take another brief sniff. Over time, your smell- memory will improve.\n\nUsing Olfactory fatigue to your advantage: When a perfumer wants to isolate a particular smell (such as when trying to figure out an ingredient in an unknown composition) the perfumer can deliberately fatigue him/herself to the known ingredients so that the unknown ones stick out.\n\n[At this point, I had people deliberately sniff a blend of two ingredients, one of which was much stronger than the other (damascone beta and a bergamot accord).  I then had them deliberately smell the damascone beta for a few minutes until they became fatigued to the smell. I then had them re-smell the original mixture to show how much more prominent the bergamot became]\n\n**Smelling similarities**\n\nMolecules with similar names can have similar smells, whether it's the prefix or the suffix. There’s lots of variation in this (for example, in salicylates), but if you’re familiar with how acetates, alcohols and aldehydes smell and you’ve smelled the acetate and aldehyde of something, you can often guess how the alcohol version is going to smell.\n\n**Common suffixes**\n\n* Alcohol – ends in “ol” or “alcohol” – reasonably mild smelling version of\nthe molecule\n* Aldehyde – ends in “al” or “aldehyde” – strong and harsh smelling\nversion of the molecule, often with a distinct aldehyde smell\n* Acetate – ends in “acetate” – reasonably mild smelling version of the molecule with distinct acetate smell\n* Oxide – ends in oxide – reasonably mild smelling version of the molecule\nwith a distinct oxide smell\n* Salicylate – ends in salicylate – often sweet and slightly basalmic version\nof the molecule.\n\n[In the class at this point, I had people smell phenyl ethyl alcohol, phenyl ethyl acetate, phenyl ethyl aldehyde, phenyl ethyl butyrate, and phenyl ethyl salicylate to see if they could identify a common \"phenyl ethyl\" smell.  I also had them smell linalool, linalyl acetate and then linalool oxide, lime oxide and rose oxide]\n\n**PART 3**\n\n**Evaluating new ingredients**\n\nDifferent ingredients smell different in different dilutions. Ingredients that are overpowering or distasteful smelling at 100% concentration can smell mild and pleasant at 1% or 0.1% concentration. Additionally some ingredients can be valuable because of the effects that they have on the smell of other ingredients. Hedione is one of the most famous examples of this. By itself it smells very mild, but it has an powerful effect on other ingredients.\nWhen evaluating a new ingredient, you should do the following:\n\n* Evaluate the ingredient in different concentrations – Start at 10%, but feel free to dilute even further. Take a small whiff of the ingredient neat to get an idea of how the smell changes as the concentration changes\n* Smell the ingredient in an example formula that showcases it\n* Smell the same formula without that ingredient (or with a substitute) - Often, the most insight comes from this step because it will also give an idea of the effect that the ingredient has on the other ingredients in the composition\n\nKey accords are all example formulas. The link to the Good Scents Demo formulas is also very helpful here.\n\n**Evaluating an ingredient and building a demo formula**\n\nIn order to see the effect that any particular ingredient has on the composition, make a version that excludes that ingredient and compare it to the complete formula.\n\n* Hedione - (very light all-around enhancer) - 58\n* Galaxolide 50% (musk) 28\n* Iso e super (smooth woody amber - velvety) 8\n* Habanolide (sweet musk) - 6\n* Ambroxan 10% - 20\n* Linalool (lighly floral) 6\n* Helional (ozone) 4\n* Calone 10% (marine) (this is a solid, heat gently to melt) 20\n\n[I had each person make two version of this accord.  One version was made according to the formula above.  The other version was missing an ingredient.  Each student was assigned to skip a different ingredient.  Students then passed around the versions that were missing an ingredient and compared them to their finished version to try to understand what each ingredient added to the accord]\n\n**PART 4**\n\nGC/MS is a Gas Chromatograph with a Mass Spectrometer attached. The Gas Chromatograph separates a sample into it’s individual components and then passes each of the components through a mass spectrometer to see what they are. The mass spectrometer compares the behavior of the material to a database of results from known materials and then outputs what it believes the material to be.\n\nA GC/MS will give information on the percentage and amounts of individual molecules and will generally identify most or all of them. Complex natural oils are broken up into their constituent molecules though, so a peak of linalool could come from a combination of neroli, bergamot, lavender and rose. Notes listings can be helpful when doing this reconstruction.\n\nTheoretically one could recreate a fragrance from a GC/MS, but often, some of the most important ingredients are found in very small amounts. Pyrazines, for example, can add a pronounced smell even when they are present in amounts so tiny as to not even register as a blip. Also, GC/MS devices aren’t always good at detecting isomers. They may not be very good at telling the difference between Hedione and Paradisone or Iso E Super and Timbersilk.\n\nThere are also GC/MS devices that have the exhaust ports connected to a cooling sleeve so that a trained perfumer can sniff each molecule as it comes out and try to identify it.\n\nSeveral GC/MS readouts are attached to this packet.\n\n[They aren't attached here, but you can find some on the web]\n\n\n**Aromachemicals provided**\n\n**Ambroxan 10% in DPG** – base note – A synthesized version of a molecule that originally comes from ambergris. It’s not technically part of ambergris, but ambrein, the main component in ambergris, oxidizes in air to turn into ambroxan and ambrinol. These oxidation products are what gives ambergris its distinctive smell. Ambroxan has a clean, dry, amber note and is a very, very long lasting base note. It is very popular in modern fragrances. On its own, it’s a crystalline powder.\n\n**Calone 10% in DPG** – base note – Smells like fresh air, water and/or melon depending on the dilution. This was the ingredient that started the aquatic trend. Found in Cool Water, Dune and most other aquatics. Very powerful. Very long lasting. On its own, it’s a crystalline powder with a low melting point. A water bath in hot water out of the tap will be enough to melt it. So will a hot summer day.\n\n**Cologne Key Accord** – base note – This is a modern “cologne” accord that is based on a demo formula from Givaudan that can be found here: https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/Images/sds/Key%20Accord%20Formula/Cologne.pdf\n\n**Coumarin 10% in DPG** – base note –A synthesized version of a molecule that occurs naturally in tonka beans, hay, sweet grass and many other things. Almost all “tonka bean” notes in commercial fragrances are actually just coumarin, and have been since the 1880s. Coumarin, is sweet, spicy and a bit herbaceous. It can be found in most commercial fragrances. On its own, it’s a crystalline powder.\n\n**Dihydro Myrcenol** – heart note – Cologne fresh, almost lavender-like. It was originally used largely in functional fragrance such as detergents. In the 1970s, people started to use it in fine fragrance (Paco Rabanne pour Homme was one of the first in 1973). Drakkar Noir is the quintessential Dihydro Myrcenol heavy fragrance.\n\n**Galaxolide 50% in IPM** – base note – A strong, floral diffusing white musk that is very popular in fragrances today. One of the so-called “laundry musks.”\n\n**Habanolide** – base note – One of the traditional white musks. Slightly sweet and fresh.\n\n**Hedione** – heart note – Hedione is a jasmine-like aromachemical with a faint smell and a powerful effect. It smooths out blends and adds a rich florality to them. In order to get a good idea of hedione’s effects, make a blend. Add a bit of hedione to one and leave the other without. This is the “normal” hedione. There’s also a version with a larger amount of the “cis” isomer, which has more exaltant effects called Hedione HC. Firmenich also makes a version that is 100% cis, called Paradisone that’s currently captive. Hedione is used very commonly in modern fragrances.\n\n**Helional** – heart note – Harsh, haylike and ozonic with metallic nuances. Luca Turin described the smell as “like sucking on a silver spoon.”\n\n**Iso E Super (Patchouli Ethanone)** – base note – Iso E Super is a very long lasting woody, dry amber smell with some hints of freshness. It’s actually the trade name for a mixture of isomers. Timbersilk is a mixture of the same isomers in different ratios. Iso E Super is a remarkably good fixative in small amounts. In larger amounts, it imparts it’s own unique scent and tends to mute other notes, making them a bit “fuzzy.” Most fragrances today use some amount of Iso E Super (or another Patchouli Ethanone). Molecule 01 uses a high gamma version that’s an IFF captive.\n\n**Limonene** – top note – Limonene is a molecule that occurs naturally in citrus peels. In fact, most of the limonene that’s available comes from the waste peels from the orange juice industry. When you squeeze an orange peel and a spray of oil comes out, that’s largely limonene. Limonene is citrusy, sweet and fresh smelling but can remind some people of cleaners because it’s used heavily in them. Invaluable in citrus compositions and as a general freshener.  You can tell that the limonene that you're getting came from orange juice waste because if it didn't, it wouldn't smell like oranges at all.  According to some recent research done at Givaudan by Charles Sell, the more you purify limonene, the less it smells of citrus.  The current theory is that limonene itself smells vaguely pine-like but that it has a high affinity for aldehydes that affect it's odor profile.  In other words, \"limonene\" is mostly just a carrier for tiny amounts of high impact aldehydes that are found in citrus peels.\n\n**Linalool** – top note – Very floral, light and somewhat sweet. Linalool is one of the major components of lavender (40%), Rosewood (90+), freesia (the headspace is mostly linalool) and is in most flowers. Most fragrances have some amount of linalool in them.\n\n**Methyl Ionone (aka Isoraldeine)** – heart note – Ionones are found in nature and tend to smell violetlike or orrislike. Ionone alpha, Ionone beta, Methyl ionone and the dihydro ionones are the most commonly used ionones. The characteristic smell of violets cannot be extracted in traditional ways and so almost all violet notes come from synthetic ionones. Methyl Ionone has a fine rich violet note with hints of orris (iris root).\n\n**Phenyl Ethyl Alcohol (aka Phenethyl Alcohol)** – heart note – A relatively long-lasting rosy note. Found in roses and in other flowers. Often used in floral accords\n\n**Timbersilk (Patchouli Ethanone)** – base note – A drier, woodier version of Iso E Super with a larger amount of the desirable gamma isomer.\n",

        "body": "Hey, Clever. Thanks a second time.\n\nI have a question about Phenyl Ethyl Alcohol that just popped into my mind as I read through this. The question springs from the name of the chemical as an \"alcohol\" ....and I admit in advance a great ignorance with regard to chemistry, so only chuckle off-mike please.\n\nWith regular alcohol-based perfumes like most of us wear everyday, the perfumer mixes up a soup of EOs and other aromachems and then mixes that with odorless perfumer's alcohol (for example). We spritz that on our arm; the alcohol evaporates; leaving behind the oils and other aromatic components which volatilize and make us smell good.\n\nMy question is this: Is it possible to use Phenyl Ethyl Alcohol as your carrier alcohol (in place of perfumer's alcohol in this example) ... and if you did, when it evaporates does any of the rosy smell stay on skin or does it disappear completly as the ahcohol vaporizes?\n\nIOW, with perfumer's ahcohol and rose EO, the alcohol evaporates leaving behind the molecules of rose EO to smell good.  .... but when Phenyl Ethyl Alcohol evaporates where does the \"rosy\" smell go or is something left behind that still smells of rose?\n\nThank you greatly in advance.",

I have a couple of Questions if you don't mind. \n\nWith regards to something along the lines of Limonene, is that a catch-all term for any the molecule found in any citrus, or is it specific to a certain one? For example, the molecules of a lemon grown in Amalfi may smell different from a lemon grown in California, but both would be called Limonene?\n\nFor a beginner, is there anyway that I can train my nose to 'smell passed' the alcohol found in fragrance? There are some that are highly praised (Bleu de Channel and Imperial Millisime spring to mind), that both smell of nothing but alcohol to me. I'd love to be able to discover what they're 'meant' to smell like.",

If you are not use to strong indicas “start low, go slow ! “ very effective for chronic pain and sleep disorders but what’s most impressive is you wake up feeling very clean and fresh after what the effects have to offer 👌👌 absolutely loving everything about this strain, after some research I have found that it’s 26%-32% and the main terpenes are caryophyllene, limonene, linalool with no percentages so it’s almost impossible to find out the exact percentage of terps. $149 for 10g 🤙🤙 ",

    "body": "*This is the latest entry in my blog series, [Notes from the Lab](https://www.barristerandmann.com/blogs/our-blog), detailing my ongoing work on the composition for a new perfume entitled* Lavender, Interrupted. *Hope you enjoy.*\n\nAs I believe I mentioned [previously](https://www.barristerandmann.com/blogs/our-blog/notes-from-the-lab-giving-lavender-its-due), lavender is tricky business. Strong but volatile, to the point that much of the oil will be gone from a piece of blotter paper in under an hour, it’s always a balancing act to get it to do what you want. This is the story of how I got what I wanted.\n\nAfter quite a lot of experimentation and development, I eventually discarded entirely the idea of creating a classical lavender accord. It’s just not what the project calls for–too soft, too pillowy, too laundry-esque. In the context of the overall work, I need a sharp, crisp lavender that can offset the richness of the rest of the fragrance, but that won’t hang around long enough to overpower it. It needs to dry down smoothly and cleanly, with just a touch of ink, as the heavier components of the fragrance begin to warm up and come to the fore. So, after I had selected the raw lavender material from which to work, the next challenge was to build an accord around it.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, an “accord” is meant to give a distinct olfactory impression. Returning to the paint mixing analogy, if “purple” is basic lavender oil, think of a lavender accord as “purple with touches of red or blue, with perhaps just a bit of white to lighten it, depending on how you want it to look.” It’s often a question of just what kind of accord you’ve envisioned; in this case, as noted, I wanted something sharp and clean that stands in contrast to the dark, rich, woody characteristics that I’m planning to create next, but that won’t hang around for long enough to interfere with their development and which fades smoothly into the background. To put it another way and compare it to music, I wanted a lavender accord like the opening clarinet solo in [*Rhapsody in Blue*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U-IXWaapx4): something that gets your attention, draws you in, but then fades away to give you a front-row seat to the rest of the work.\n\nWhen constructing a lavender accord, or really any accord based on a natural material, the old perfumer’s trick is to simply add more of the major components of that material until you’ve reached the style of accord that you want. Because [the major constituents of lavender oil are linalool and linalyl acetate](https://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/gca/gc1096991.html), these are the materials with which I started.\n\nFairly early on, I determined that regular linalool is not exactly what I want for this lavender, so I turned instead to its ethyl analogue. [Ethyl linalool](https://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/data/rw1015171.html) is richly lavendery, without the intense citrus overtones that characterize the regular linalool alcohol, and is less temperamental than its more common cousin. To that I added [linalyl acetate](https://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/data/rw1007892.html), which carries a powerfully tangy bergamot-like character (and is, in fact, one of the major components of bergamot oil as well). But then came a new question: how could I provide solidity to the accord without overwhelming its lavenderiness or making it smell like laundry detergent?\n\nThe answer, as it turned out, came from a combination of new tech and old tech. The old tech is a combination of the materials [helional](https://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/data/rw1007732.html) and [hedione](https://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/data/rw1015272.html), both of which impart velvety volume and transparency to the accord. The new tech is [calone](https://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/data/rw1002352.html), aka watermelon ketone: an intensely briny, melon-like, extraordinarily ozonic material that features in roughly 90% (my estimate) of all the masculine fragrances and laundry detergents in existence. I tend to dislike its use at the high levels that you might find in *Cool Water* or *Light Blue*, but, in trace amounts (below 1%), it imparts solidity and volume to transparent floral accords, giving my particular design a character like the olfactory equivalent of silvered violet glass. Imagine looking through a perfectly clear piece of lightly purple crystal and you’ll get the basic idea.\n\nLast, but certainly not least, the accord needed a touch of sweetness and powder to allow it to transition into the rest of the fragrance. I had initially considered [vanillin](https://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/data/rw1011712.html), which is the only vanilla material used in Lavanille, but opted instead to use the more complex and interesting [veratraldehyde](https://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/data/rw1030991.html), which has facets of heliotrope, sugar, powder, wood, vanilla, and cream. It’s wonderfully versatile and exceedingly powerful, but the lightest touch of the stuff made for the perfect finish to the accord and will serve to lift the main vanilla accord, which has yet to be composed.\n\nOnly four more to go.",

The Orange cake has dense green and purple buds shining with Sugary/Frosty trichomes. Grinded up nice and easy, set the Ball vape to 500 degrees for the Terp taste. \n\nSo I hit the Orange cake at 500 degrees and I got a really nice Creamy (fizz) orange taste with a undertone of pine, I could also taste a sweet and sour taste probably with the mix of fruity terps limonene and Linalool, lemon and pineapple created a type of sweet fizzy sour taste. After 15minutes I could feel as tho my body wanted to become one with the couch I was sat on, my bones melted into the couch safe to say I felt nicely medicated even in the low temp. \n\nBumped the temp up to 530-560 degrees and this stuff just put me in a coffin the sleep was that good haha. Taste even at a higher temp was still really good and the effects come along nicely with it. \n\nOverall this strain gave me a nice heavy body relaxed feeling and an energetic mental high. So although my body was not wanting to move my mind still stayed wanting to do stuff. But if I wished to calm the mind I would vape more at higher temps extracting the higher terp % in the Mycrene. 8.5/10",

The buds are Sticky, have Beautiful colours. grinds up fluffy, has an amazing cure aswell !\n\nSMELL/AROMA: wow this one is a Very sweet candy smell, very reminiscent of fairy floss & blue heaven topping. such a sweet candy smell that becomes a gassy candy smell with other notes when you break the buds apart. note that it’s not super strong but it sticks around which i love.\n\nTASTE: Oh my… this is like nothing i’ve tried before… Fairy Floss, Candy, Citrus, Sweet, slight soap & spice undertones / TASTE PROFILE IS INSANE. Also reminiscent of blue heaven. the layers just don’t stop, this is by far the best tasting mc i have had.\n\nEFFECTS: Was so relieved to find out this strain also had legs for days. it’s got lots of euphoria and a very nice cerebral buzz.  starts with a Head and then body high music is better, feel like a cloud. can couch lock imo at higher doses, slightly sedative. \n\nTLDR/OVERALL: I was thoroughly impressed by this strain. and was nervous since i heard about mould issues and quality issues with alma. and unfortunately there’s been some on cream fritter but this strain has impressed me in every single way possible, the cure, the smell, the aroma, the taste and the effects ! for the price this is the best premium mc you can get at this moment for something with legs in every category. will be getting this again.\n\nAPPEAL/PACKAGING 9/10\n\nSMELL/AROMA 9/10\n\nTASTE 9.5/10\n\nEFFECTS 8.5/10\n\nOVERALL 9/10 💚\n",

I've tried no poo and low poo and went sulfate and silicone free for years but my hair looks best with sulfates and silicones.

First of all, there is so much sodium in it that it will actually over-cleanse your hair and leave it very dry — something I don’t recommend for anyone with textured hair or normal/dry skin conditions. If you have colored hair (highlights, single process, etc) DO NOT USE THIS. All the money you paid your stylist will go down the drain, as shampoos like this have pH levels way beyond the natural pH of our hair and skin, which can cause more harm than good. Hope that helps — I’d recommend that you buy good shampoo from your stylist or at Ulta.",

    "body": "This is my second script for this flower, and deserving of a review, as you will see…\n\nFirst things first—presentation matters, and Cherry Oh Baby delivers.\n\nThis beauty arrived in a 10g glass container, tucked inside a box—fancy and impressive. At $15/g, it’s a bargain for medical-grade flower, especially packing a 28% THC (see CoA on Catalyst) punch (though honestly, it felt even stronger).\n\nSpoiler alert: This one doesn’t mess around.\n\nFirst Impressions – Looks, Smell & Vibes\n\nPop the jar, and boom—pure gas and skunk. If you love those loud, funky strains, this one’s for you. I picked up some of my favorite terpenes right away:\n\t•\tLimonene – That zesty, mood-boosting citrus.\n\t•\tβ-Caryophyllene – Spicy, earthy, and brings a relaxing body feel.\n\t•\tLinalool – A hint of floral calm.\n\nLikely, there’s also a dash of:\n\t•\tMyrcene – A subtle herbal vibe that adds to the potency.\n\t•\tTerpinolene – Known for giving that sweet-but-fuel punch.\n\nThe buds? Perfectly cured and harvested, with a clean, frosty appearance—and yeah, I included a close-up photo for you to admire.\n\nEffects & Adventure – Mowing Mishaps & Wild Ideas\n\nAs is tradition, I gave it the “smoke and mow the lawn” test.\n\nLet’s just say—it turned into an adventure.\n\nWith some great tunes and a sunny day, I was cruising along… until I got the mower bogged. Yep—stuck. Had to call a friend to pull me out (thankfully, no judgment was passed).\n\nNote to self: No operating heavy machinery while enjoying Cherry Oh Baby.\n\nBut here’s the fun part—this strain got my creativity flowing. I came up with one of the craziest ideas I’ve ever had. Was it practical? Not even close. But sharing it with friends turned into a hilarious, high-energy conversation.\n\nIt’s a sativa leaning hybrid powerhouse—not for beginners or the faint-hearted. Seriously, it is one of the strongest flowers I have smoked in Australia. This flower will have you buzzing, thinking, and maybe getting into a little mischief.\n\nFinal Thoughts – Power & Personality\n\nCherry Oh Baby is a beast. It’s:\n✅ Strong as hell—felt more than 28% THC.\n✅ High in Terpenes - 1.5%\n✅ Clean and well-cured—high-quality from jar to joint.\n✅ Creative and energetic—perfect for social vibes (or wild ideas).\n\nBut seriously—stay away from the lawnmower.\n\nPhotos  📸- yes, I went to visit a friends cannabis farm, and took my medicine with me. It felt good to show the plant where it ends up! Hope you enjoy the pics.\n\nFinal Score? 9.5/10. A total bargain for the price, and one of the strongest flowers I’ve smoked in a long time.\n\nIf you love big energy, big flavors, and don’t mind a little chaos—Cherry Oh Baby is calling your name.\n\nTried it? Let me know how your adventure went. 😉🍒🔥",

    "body": "**Skin** : Dehydrated + Oily + Dry Patches + Acne. My skin feels easily suffocated. I have Sahara Desert around Mouth and Oil tankers on Cheeks.\n\n**Cost**: 950Rs for 500ml (I got it for cheaper price in Nykaa Summer sale : \\~560Rs )\n\n The opening of the bottle is a tiny hole which is provided with a cap that can be removed and set again. It helps in preventing any leakage from bottle. I am basically very lazy to hold that big bottle, so I transferred some toner to TO Serum bottle and using it. \n\n**The Feel:**\n\nIt has watery flowy consistency. The cloudy milky color gives the feeling of moisture in my head. It doesn't have any strong fragrance. It gives a very light healthy dewy glow finish to the skin post application. I didn't get any irritation / itching particularly from this toner.\n\n**My experiments:** \n\nI initially used it alone and my dehydrated skin just drank up all the toner and it gave smooth texture and the hydrated glow to my oily skin. It definitely worked for me and I could see the difference by 2nd time of use itself. However, I felt that the toner alone was not enough to prevent TEWL. I felt dehydrated again after 3 times of using this toner alone.\n\nI then started using the toner for sometime in the hot and humid climate and topping it with thick moisturizer and heavy sunscreen. I broke out. I realized that my skin is feeling too much moisturization and oily. So, I had to stop using this toner and sunscreen (I stayed away from sun) and switched to a light moisturizer until my breakouts calmed down. But, deep down I badly needed that hydration that the toner gives. \n\n**How I ended up using it:**\n\nCurrently, I'm mixing 4-5 drops of the toner to my moisturizer (Nivea Soft) and woahhh I love it. I feel like I can make the right consistency of the mixture for my skin. It feels hydrated and moisturized at the same time now. My skin looks very much normal and nice instead of being too oily or too dry. I'm surprised the way my crazy skin has finally found the balance.\n\n I also tried adding few drops of the toner to Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion and it didn't go well at all. Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion has this different consistency that doesn't go well with this toner when mixed up. However, I like it well with Nivea Soft. I get more lighter version of Nivea Soft by mixing with this toner.  Also, my skin never felt dehydrated again with this toner + moisturizer mixing technique. This is the way I'm going to use this or any other toner for the rest of my life. \n\nI definitely like to repurchase this toner considering the discount and the quantity we get for it. \n\n**Full Ingredients List:**\n\n Water Dipropylene Glycol Glycerin Water Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate Glycereth-26 1,2-Hexanediol Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil Water Phenyl Trimethicone Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer Styrene/VP Copolymer Centella Asiatica Extract Ethylhexylglycerin Glycerin Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer Tromethamine Disodium EDTA Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil Citrus Limon (Lemon) Seed Oil Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride Water Allantoin Hydrogenated Lecithin Phytosteryl/Octyldodecyl Lauroyl Glutamate Panthenol Ceramide NP Sodium Hyaluronate Linalool Limonene",

The higher the thc, the lower the terps, and for me personally I prioritise high terps 🤩\n\nThe top terps are beta caryophyllene, limonene, alpha bisabolol, linalool and myrcene. Those terps combine to make the most complex and layered orange flavours. There is the slightest floral hint, with citrus and grapefruit and rind, and a very minor background of pine 🌲 \n\nIt is very sweet and absolutely beautiful - it’s a tub I cannot stop opening because I’m in love with the divine aroma 🥳\nIt is like a day version of Delta Tetra Orange Cake which I also absolutely love 🍊 🍰 \nBeing absolutely not a fan of old dry and muted OZ MC, this is an absolute delight. \n\nIt’s grown in BC, cured to perfection. Grinds up very fluffy and passes the sticky icky test with flying colours, giving the full kinetic sand dance 💃 it doesn’t get fresher and better cured than this 🫶🏽\n\nI got all medium to large nugs with one 3.62g nug!\n\nThe taste translates beautifully in my TM2 and I also tried it in my Omura with a flower stick and I got lots of lovely billowy vape clouds ⭐️\n\nThe nuggets are a fairly bright green with orange pistils, it’s lovely and frosty 😃\n\nWhere it shines of course is the effects, wow! Treating depression- I’m looking mostly for a strong mood uplift, this delivers in spades. It is one of the most uplifting strains I’ve ever had, apart from Broken Coast Sunset Sherbert and special shout out to Sativite Walken and Single Estate Pebble Punch 🙌🏽\n\n\nThe effects are really long lasting. It does tick the box for me for a day strain, but I would rotate it with other uplifting and energising day strains eg terpinolene dom strains to have options depending on set and setting, as this has a creative and cruisy feeling to it. It makes the world feel like a better place ☮️ 🕊️ \n\nI can’t believe I waited to try this, and I find the incredible combination of smell, taste, terps, freshness and effects makes this one of my favorite strains EVER in OZ MC and it will be staying firmly in my rotation 🧡🧡🧡\n\nBroken Coast have some great strains - really lovingly grown craft cannabis. \nNext appointment I’ll definitely get a script for their platinum pave too!🥰\n\nHappy holidays MCOZ tribe 🌱💚\n",

I’ve been struggling trying to find a new day strain. I’m loving Broken Coast OG Kush Breath before bed. That was my first from them and have been really happy with it. I think I will dial this one in next consult.\nMerry Christmas😀",

After a few months, it spread on two of my fingers (photo 2). It didn't take long for it to quickly spread on both my hands; on every finger and my palm. It was debilitating, I didn't know what was causing it and I was in denial, I thought it was just stress. I did not want to use steroid creams, and I tried everything; apple cider vinegar soaks, permanganate soaks, vaseline, and so much more. I only used steroids when I couldn't bare the pain (photos 3 & 4).\n\nIt continued to spread and it got infected several times and I had to take antibiotics because it was getting so bad. After seeing about 4 different dermatologists, I found a doctor who put me on Cyclosporine and a waiting list for a patch test. Cyclosporine tamed the redness, but the bubbles persised (photos 5 - 8) as I did not know what my triggers were. I finally stopped denying my condition and blaming it on stress and food intolerances, so stopped using scented soaps and was very cautious of what I touched with my hands, so I could go a few days without flaring up. After months on Cyclosporine I finally did a patch test (photos 9 & 10). \n\nI found out I was allergic to 5 chemicals out of the 52 in the patch test; Colophonium (Rosin), Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Linalool, Propolis and Cobalt. I gave away all my soaps, my perfumes, my make up and other cosmetics which triggered my eczema. Now, I started to wear only cotton and soft fabrics, and I am now more cautious of the ingredients in the products I use. \n\nIt was a very long and painful road, which affected me mentally and physically. I never thought I would see my hands clear of eczema again. I am so thankful that I am here today, and I wish everyone with the same condition as me fast healing. Please find your triggers and if necessary do a patch test.\n\nTake care of yourselves 💗",

I have tried to recreate madonna lily many times off gcms using only headspace naturals- not a thing. I think sometimes its better to learn the natural and use the best mats available to approximate the note, irrespective of the gcms. I see the gcms as a starting point, but not a rosetta stone. I personally have had way more success using Louis Apell formulas than gcms as starting points. But ymmv.",

Reviewing some sunscreen/makeup removers today.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o825xixzx6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=686f4f5f086654b57e35cd8906675ccf223ed22a\n\n**My skin type:** Sensitive, very dry (Actives: tretinoin microsphere 0.04%, AHA/BHA peel)\n\n**I Wear:** Heavy-duty, waterproof sunscreen on the daily, on makeup days - heavy-duty waterproof makeup, especially waterproof eye makeup that is difficult to remove. I have hooded lids (full Korean).\n\n**Fragrance is not a deal-breaker for me in wash-off products, although I am wearier of essential oils than I am of synthetic fragrance. Will be bolding main fragrance ingredients.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kzfesai0y6251.jpg?width=425&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df6aa8bee3c981d106a4ee4e3d071a26002ea80a\n\n**Cost:** 8 oz - $24 (Ulta)\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Coco-Glucoside, Coconut Alcohol, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Glycerin, Carbomer, Isopropyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Citric Acid, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, **Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil,** Propylparaben, Triethanolamine, **Amyris Balsamifera (Amyris) Bark Oil, Bulnesia Sarmientoi Wood (Vera Wood) Oil, Cymbopogon Martini (Palmarosa) Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens (Sweet Scented Geranium) Flower Oil, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Oil, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Mimosa Tenuiflora Bark Extract, Ormenis Multicaulis (Wild Moroccon Chamomile) Oil, Piper Nigrum (Pepper) Fruit Oil, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Oil,** Fd&C Yellow No. 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n**Texture:** A pale yellow, milky, lightly foaming cleanser of medium thickness.\n\n**Efficacy:** Acceptable as a one-step travel cleanser. Pretty good at removing sunscreen and makeup if you take the time to massage it in. Felt like a godsend before being completely spoiled by AB first cleansers. That was when I thought a little bit of waterproof mascara being left over giving me slight raccoon eyes when I woke up in the morning was \"acceptable\" and \"as good as it's gonna get\".\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** No. Has gentle surfactants but **it also has TWELVE different essential oils.** One of which is endangered and need active conservation according to Wikipedia, which I personally don't feel comfortable using:\n\n>*Bulnesia sarmientoi* was listed as [endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species) in the 2018 publication of the [IUCN Red List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List), due to the [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation) of [Gran Chaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Chaco#Conservation_issues) and a strong global demand for its wood, extracts, and [essential oils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil) since 2001.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulnesia_sarmientoi#cite_note-IUCN-1) IUCN estimates indicate that over three generations the global population will decline by around 50%.\n\nRequires much more massaging to remove waterproof makeup which may be harsh on sensitive skin and cause more redness.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy. Not too strong.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No, it's a 2-in-1. However, it does not always get rid of everything on the first try, so another cleanse may be necessary.\n\n**Repurchase?** No. It did not bother my sensitive skin too much, but I'm cutting out all essential oils from my skincare + not effective enough as a first cleanser.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Naive Botanical Olive Cleansing Oil 230mL / 7.8 oz\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ovky561y6251.png?width=207&format=png&auto=webp&s=fecf9195af66872bce90dabfe904de2a500678a5\n\nI found out about this [here, ranked #4](https://my-best.net/15468). I wanted something with the highest cleansing power that washed off cleanly & is affordable.\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $14 on eBay before pandemic started. A little less than $7 in Japan. Even at double the price for me in the US, I have had this since **July 2019** (June 2020 now) and I am only *halfway through* it because of how incredibly effective it is with small amounts. I would run out of other cleansing oils relatively fast because of how much it takes to remove all my layers of waterproof makeup. Am shocked tbh.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, ethylhexyl palmitate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, glyceryl tri (caprylic acid / capric acid), PEG-8 glyceryl isostearate, sorbeth tetraisostearate-30, olive leaf extract, olive fruit oil, squalane, BG Water, cyclohexane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid bisethoxy diglycol, **perfume.**\n\n**Texture:** A cleansing oil of medium thickness, not overly greasy. Smooth, spreads very easily. Not super thin like something like Kose Softymo Speedy.\n\n**Efficacy:** Not drying at all on my very dry skin. SUPER effective at removing waterproof sunscreen and makeup. Takes absolutely NO TIME AT ALL, which is very different from other cleansing oils that required me to massage it in for a while. Color me beyond impressed. This is honestly the best first cleanser I've used so far. ZERO residue of any trace of makeup after removal.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes and no. It did not bother me personally but it does contain fragrance. I'm unsure if the current ingredient list is accurate as the Japanese ranking site states it contains essential oils but the list from Yesstyle does not.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy, woodsy. Not so strong that it is super bothersome.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Absolutely. As soon as it becomes affordable again when the pandemic dies down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Moistage W Cold Cream 270g / 9.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tcxvpzp1y6251.jpg?width=249&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0996cc355ecab1a721c0c6316ef76089e89c8b6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q416df74y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd8cd5a3d8cf58c3c0822eb9da142611c5826bc\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $16 on eBay. Currently about $19 on [Yesstyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/kracie-moistage-w-cold-cream-270g/info.html/pid.1069419619). Very cost-effective bc of its huge size.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, water, polysorbate 65, microcrystalline wax, glycerin, DPG, glyceryl stearate, dimethicone, stearoyl glutamate Na, stearic acid, polysorbate 80, beeswax, xanthan gum, olive oil, squalane, hydrogenated castor oil hydroxystearate, silk extract , Ethanol, hydrolyzed collagen, cetearyl alcohol, EDTA2Na, methyl paraben, ethyl paraben\\*\\*, perfume.\\*\\*\n\n**Texture:** A rich, thick white cream.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a huge NO from me, dawg. This is terrible. It barely removes anything waterproof and leaves a heavy residue. However, if you're the type of person who doesn't mind using a more stripping cleanser afterward to wash this off, or using a washcloth, I guess I can see it as being, um. Acceptable?\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** It is gentle but slightly fragranced. No reaction from my skin other than disgust at being left in a thick film after wash off.\n\n**Scent:** Very light floral.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** YES.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter 76g / 2.7 Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/znms9m83y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45f6d28d2958c8133b26a2ab363b88bcf71d065e\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $13.65 on Amazon. Currently [$14.85 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F165210/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea  (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, **Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene,** Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Citric Acid.\n\n**Texture:** A thick, opaque white balm, not overly greasy or waxy.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a good first cleanser. Quite travel friendly but I have not traveled with it in weather that would melt it so I don't know if it would leak through. It removes everything quite well, no complaints here. It still is not as good as the Kracie botanical olive one, takes longer to break down sunscreen and makeup, and may leave behind a slight amount of waterproof mascara if you aren't thorough enough with massaging/letting it sit on the skin long enough to melt everything.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Has not bothered mine, but fragrance is pretty strong. \n\n**Scent:** Strong floral. Although not strong enough to CHOKE on like some Korean products - those of intimate with Korean skincare - you know what I'm talking about. /sideyes my mom's side of the skincare in the bathroom\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** No, I don't like the scent and the packaging. It's hard to close properly on first try. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# (Not A First Cleanser But) [Equate Eye Makeup Remover](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Beauty-Oil-Free-Eye-Makeup-Remover-5-5-oz/39139097) 5.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfnqtmh5y6251.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05638b521fa8a76a4fe2673625e2b750241a492f\n\n**Cost:** $4 \n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Chloride, Dipropylene Glycol, Poloxamer 182, Allantion, Tetrasodium Edta, Benzalkonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cucumber (Cucumis Sativus), Fruit Extract, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium Phosphate. \n\n**Texture:** You gotta shake it before use. Watery but has silicone slip and thickness. \n\n**Efficacy:** I've used this as a first cleanser with a cotton pad in a pinch on extra lazy nights. It pretty works well to remove things pretty well although it WILL leave a residue obviously that you have to wash off. Honestly can't really tell the difference between this and the Neutrogena one and it's cheaper so. I use it to remove eyelash glue and waterproof mascara that I put on them. \n\nIt doesn't magically whisk away a mess of water-resistant lash glue residue + waterproof mascara on top of THAT (i don't really think anything can) but it's adequate, cheap, fragrance-free, oil-free and prolongs the wear on my beloved Miche Bloomin falsies (Girly Flair is the most popular bc of Pony Makeup but that style is horrible for me - it's SUPER fragile and breaks so easily compared to the other styles) by 10x. \n\nI just pour some in my palm and poke the lashes in a little puddle of it for a bit till the mascara comes off and then remove the glue with my fingers afterward. I don't wash them off afterward and whatever residue it leaves behind does not interfere at all with the next coat of mascara I put on them lashes.\n\n(Gonna write a separate review, but FYI - I prefer [DUO quick drying lash glue](https://www.ulta.com/duo-quick-set-lash-adhesive-clear?productId=pimprod2003529) in the purple label more than the super famous Japanese [D-Up Eyelash Fix](https://www.amazon.co.jp/D-UP-%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A2%E3%83%83%E3%83%97-4946324013622-D-U-P-%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC/dp/B0012VQTO2/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=d-up&qid=1590969259&sr=8-5) that's touted as #1 globally. I find that it's SOOO much quicker drying than D-Up and makes the lashes stick BETTER, longer, and stands stronger to tears. Plus it's latex-free too, for sensitive eyes. And way cheaper! I regret getting extra back ups of the D-Up thinking it'll be the best thing ever. There are still some cons that D-Up has an upperhand on, but I'll talk about that in that review post.)\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell yeah. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMini-Review on the **Garnier Skin Active Micellar Cleansing Water (Pink Cap):** This was just a sample so I ran out of it pretty fast but I remember being surprised that it actually was pretty effective at removing waterproof makeup. Scent-free, I quite liked it I think. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water, For Waterproof Makeup (Blue Cap), 13.5 Fl Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4fb7kb6y6251.jpg?width=556&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b56036478b358bd5043af8f80652b63a71cb7f9f\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $6.59 on Amazon. \n\n**Ingredients:** AQUA/WATER, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, ISOHEXADECANE, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DECYL GLUCOSIDE, POLYAMINOPROPYL BIGUANIDE. F.I.L.# D178190/1 \n\n**Texture:** Watery, greasy. I hate this. I got it mainly to remove waterproof sunscreen from my neck and chest at the end of the day without taking a whole damn shower. Leave a very unpleasant, greasy residue that I cannot stand on my skin. No. \n\n**Efficacy:** I only tried removing my makeup with this several times and it was okay I think. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Definitely. \n\n**Repurchase?** No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Sensibio H2O 500 ml / 16.7 fl oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3q1ucyc8y6251.jpg?width=443&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffe3ed17780adf84d930a94d27ae29416decdc52\n\n**Cost:** $15 on Amazon.com\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (aqua), Peg-6 Caprylic/capric Glycerides, Cucumis Sativus (cucumber) Fruit Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Propylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Cetrimonium Bromide. \n\n**Texture:** Watery, very light! Refreshing. Doesn't leave a greasy gross residue like above. I still splash water on top of the skin before toweling off and I still can feel a slight film. Ideally, I would like to wash it all off bc Lab Muffin says it's still not the best to leave surfactants on the skin, but most nights I can't be bothered and it shouldn't be *that* bad if people in places with harsh water just leave it on the skin, right? \n\nI guess a way to deal with that would be to wipe away using a toner/water/spray with a cotton pad or something but idk, that's more unnecessary garbage I feel. And more rubbing sensitive skin. \n\n**Efficacy:** This is fairly new. Got it for the same reason as the Garnier blue cap. It removes my waterproof sunscreen from my neck just fine with a baby wipe or cotton pad. But for everyday, I much prefer a cleansing oil to reduce the amount of tugging and rubbing on my skin as well as disposable wipes or pads. I tried it for removing waterproof mascara from my falsies like the Equate one, but it was okay, similar, but not as good and not as \"conditioning\" on my falsies to keep them soft. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** For me, yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** Yes! \n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext on my Wish List!!:\n\n\\- Muji Sensitive Cleansing Oil 400 ml\n\n\\- Muji Mild Cleansing Oil 400 ml \n\n\\- Muji Mild Milky Cleansing 200 ml \n\n\\- More cleansing gels (first cleansers NOT second cleansers) (I've tried Kikumasamune one before and I really liked that one for heavy, non-waterproof makeup days!

The packaging says ‘fragrance free’ but as I looked at the ingredients list I could see it wasn’t. It has orange peel oil, limonene, citral & linalool in it. I recognised them as ingredients for fragrance & googled to double check. They are all potentially irritating ingredients used for fragrance. I then had a look at the beautybay reviews & almost every one mentioned the amazing smell. I personally don’t mind a bit of fragrance but with all of these ingredients I’d stay away. I’m so disappointed as I was looking forward to try the line but now I feel like I can’t trust the company!",

Most of the people here either have a job or are students. Ive seen so many medical students here too. We are not from the influencer field who are jealous of your success nor jobless enough to start gossiping about you without actually watching your video\n\nI made the post about her sponsored video and honestly I am already feeling attacked. I never said she hid her sponsorship nor that it made her review automatically fake. I said this so many times in my comments. **I just said she was drawing the narrative that \"i dont do sponsored videos because money can make you biased. you dont buy from your own money so even if product didnt work out you atleast dont lose money thats why i dont do sponsored content. I get many sponsorships and i never reply to them. Im making this video for you and brands to know about my values. Even affiliate codes give you targets to make xyz number of purchases. I am considering a join button where people can give money only if you want without compulsion\".** There is another non indian youtuber called \"No BS beauty\" who does not do sponsored content or take PR and accepts support from her subscribers via patreon donations because they like her content. **Is it so hard to understand that if you go against the very values youre touting some people will be disappointed?** Does being anon take away your right to an opinion also? what the hell was that video. We did not make this account just to talk about samapti. When people were saying nice things about her, even then they were doing it anonymously. When someone posts their HGs here, even that is done anonymously. You're so pathetic to invalidate someone just because they're anon. The whole fkn reddit site functions under anonymity and people discussing their interests, whether it is cricket, skincare, relationship advice, science, makeup whatever the hell. And you know excela moisturiser, photostable sunscreen these have been available since many many years. I've been using them since 4 years atleast. But this subreddit got popular in 2020 March and that's when these products got popular. And suddenly all you influencers started reviewing photostable and excela, samapti maitrayee rubeena everyone. And then you have the guts to call the people here cowards, the same anon people you've have no issues using for your content and earning money in your side hustle. Slow clap. Disgusting.\n\nAnd the other user who made the fragrance post too was right. Rose, lavender are fragrant extracts and she justified it by comparing it to centella extract which is just not the same thing??? Hemp oil has a characteristic smell but hemp oil or extract doesn't have fragrant compounds that can irritate skin. Rose extract is classified as fragrant extract and is not the same to things you're comparing it to. Paula's choice also classifies extracts depending on good bad average as another user pointed out in one of the comment threads.

The volatiles consisted mainly of 2-phenylethanol (69.7-81.6%), **linalool (1.5-3.3%), citronellol (1.8-7.2%), nerol (0.2-4.2%), geraniol (0.9-7.0%)** along with rose oxides and all other characteristic minor rose compounds.\"\n\nPeople who call you fearmongering over fragrance dont say youre forcing them to use fragrance free products, but its not a crime to call out misinformation. Just like spreading fear against parabens or glycolic acid (cough dr v cough) is criticised, so are you. Same way you are criticised to call a cetaphil sunscreen as having no UVA protection because you didnt see PA+++ but are not even aware about UVA seal. Are people haters if they're calling you misinformed or saying you repeat information from labmuffin and incidecoder? Your novelty was your own product experience, not doing sponsored content etc. Grow up and stop painting every person who disagrees with you as a hater. No one from here sent you hate messages, we just discussed among ourselves. but guess what you got hateful in your video and your followers started coming here with new accounts to ask people to get a life :)\n\nAnd guess what? if calling aloe magical is a part of the brand script and not your view.. you are already being ingenuine in your review. Because it is not your own thoughts but the brand script!! And Ffs we arent content creators. Yeah we create long posts here but we don't develop a following or earn money via youtube for our watchtime. You are a content creator. Have the basic logic to know the difference between the two\n\nmore stuff i've said in response to her stupid video -\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/mx2ili/samapti\\_banerjee\\_has\\_started\\_doing\\_sponsored/gvyfuwy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/mx2ili/samapti_banerjee_has_started_doing_sponsored/gvyfuwy/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/mx2ili/samapti\\_banerjee\\_has\\_started\\_doing\\_sponsored/gvyeky4/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/mx2ili/samapti_banerjee_has_started_doing_sponsored/gvyeky4/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)",

There is nothing wronge in taking sponsorship as long as she is disclosing it and be honest about her reviews. A while ago she posted a news in community section about how government has changed the rules for sponsorship. So for now I will be still following her and will see where it takes. Everyone deserves a chance. And anyways if we did not get along with her we always have the option of unfollowing her. For now her recommendations are working for me but still I do my own research. This is just my honest opinion.😃",

        "body": "I understand what you're saying but it honestly doesn't bother me if Samapti takes up sponsorships of something that she has previously recommended or previously used. However Im a constant viewer of her channel and I don't remember her ever recommending the plum aloe Vera gel so I was kind of dissapointed a bit( or maybe I missed one of her videos IDK😅)\n\nBut I'm not going to stop following her channel just because of one or two sponsorships. Let's be honest, they need to earn money too(But looking as to how she constantly said others shouldn't take sponsorships and now takes sponsorships herself was a bit....) . If we're so skeptical then we just shouldn't buy the products sponsored(she specifically mentioned that it was sponsored).\n\nTo conclude, Samapti is one of the only people who I've seen genuinely recommend good stuff. I told watch foreign YouTube's for skincare but all the products they recommended weren't available here and it bothered me a lot but Samapti's channel was like a breath of fresh air. \nI have seen a vast majority of Indian skincare channels and it's all bs that they recommend and claim that it's good. I see some of their videos that are good and then I see a video where they're recommending to apply lemon and tea tree oil to the face and I'm like 🙄. So until and unless someone better than Samapti pops up, I'm probably gonna keep following her coz her recommendations so far for skincare seen good.",

Some mids and some smalls are you can see on the photo. Decent amount of trichomes. The moisture is a little dry. These are pale green colour.\nLZ: Mid to large buds, but more of round shape. Along side some smalls. There is one bud that has been crushed as you can see on the upper left (ive isolated). This is a much better moisture level, when you squeeze theres stickiness. \nLots of purple and green.\n\n_AROMA: HONEY CREAM: 7 || LEMON ZKITTLEZ: 7.5\nHC: this has a very unique aroma. It has a very sweet cakey smell when smelling through the Mylar bag. However when you take one out and smell it by it self, it is very herbal and tea like.\nLZ: Gassy, slightly cake and a little citrus tone. This has a better aroma and it completely different to HC, much more pungent and more gas driven.\n\n_TASTE: HONEY CREAM: 7/10 || LEMON ZKITTLEZ: 8/10\nHC: The taste was thicker and more herbal, smooth smoke no harshness. \nLZ: Great tasting, much more full bodied and you really get the citric notes coming through.\n\n_EXPERIENCE: HONEY CREAM: 7.5/10 || LEMON ZKITTLEZ: 8.5/10\nHC: This is a nice chilled experience. perfect for the afternoon and when you want to wind down. This is a nice chilled experience. Started in the eyes and behind the eyes, and moved slowly to the body. Very creative when i had it but little to no head chatter.\nThis strain is a great strain to listen to music or watch a movie.\nLZ: This is a very heady strain, a heavy strain. Very much immediate effect. Generally it stayed in your head for most of the duration.  This is the strain i used a lot more this week hence the little amount left.  Surprisingly after heavy use, i had no hang over next day.\n\n_OVERALL: HONEY CREAM 7/10 || LEMON ZKITTLEZ 8/10\nThese two are EXTREMELY different strains. The HC is a chilled experience where as LZ is much more intense. I think they serve very different purposes.\nThese are not world beaters, however they are most definitely craft flower (hand trimmed, cured)\nThe person who said it was machine dried, this is absolutely not true. Someone also said that this was machine trimmed. Again this is untrue, you can see no machine damage from the bud structure at all.\nFor the price, these are DECENT. If you expect this to be Ice Burn or Permanent Marker or Hawaiian Rain. You are dreaming.",

I really find comfort in writing about feelings and thoughts on this subreddit because most of yall are so relatable and so nice to send me DMs (and oops i think i deleted 1 of them accidentally psps, really a big boomer on reddit sobs- so if you still want to talk/converse/rant, feel free!! I love talking to random strangers online <3. (oop not the omegle kind tho HAHAH)\n\nWeek 2 of written As. I know some of my peers are still mugging for physics/ELL, and some of my friends are currently writing their history paper,, but since I am still procrastinating before really cramming bio later, here's how this week has been thus far for me at least. \n\nPerhaps we all know about that someone who appears full of energy and seemingly zero frowns after the papers so far, (and I don't know about you but I really do feel like punching that someone who says stuff like \"damnn that elucidation be easy bro\" or \"bro I studied linalool like one second before damn shiok la\"), and perhaps we are know of those friends who are frantically worried, afraid that what they have submitted was a far cry from quality work. I really am kinda stuck in between - feeling somewhat dehumanised and having no tears left to cry, but still sad that I made so many avoidable careless mistakes and even failing to do questions that the majority could... \n\nECONS paper 1 just yesterday was somewhat a dull heartache - there were some questions so basic, yet others so tricky and demanding,, and i honestly don't know how to feel about it... And came CHEM today, which was a hella rollercoaster ride especially with that 10 mark structural elucidation question. I was also just so mad at how I mastered electrochem and there was only a 1 mark pathetic Echem calculation... I know MLC said something about how the paper was expected, and some of my friends from other schools were saying how this was of resemblance to prelims, but please it was just a completely different story for me, and perhaps many of my other friends. It is just so frustrating that I really don't know where I stand and it is just way too easy to say \"forget and move on\". How I wish this was still an internal exam...\n\nOn my last post, I talked about moving on (hm long story tho), assuring yourself that you can do it regardless of what happens, and I really don't know about you, but I say this is the only way to go my friends. Our mental resilience gotta be stronger than the unpredictability of Cambridge/SEAB!! We are more than halfway done with all our papers, and even if you are upset like how I am, there is really no point to harp over our mistakes. (honestly even some answers circulating on reddit could be wrong... and idk how Cambridge marks exactly i am just hoping they mark with a gracious amount of leniency and close one eye on my mistakes) JIAYOUS EVERYBODY!!  \\~2 WEEKS LEFT!! whoop whoop \n\n(ADD: anyway to everyone who felt they underperformed: its okay! don't think about it anymore!! must keep hypnotizing yourself,,, and stay strong!!!!!!!; those who performed up to expectations: ok lor gfy bro keep it up)\n\n\\[oKAY damn i do feel better from writing this tho!! highly advisable for peeps who like writing to express their feelings to just utilise this reddit channel (?- honestly don't know if this is a channel/thread/wtv) to the max!... time to study bio (\\~screw potatoes and gel electrophoresis my >20 mark gone)\\]",

Upon further review I will say I am definitely impressed for the price point. Picked this up at TOL North for $120 for a full OZ. Mainly was interested due to the high THC and good terps as well. Was a little disappointed with having the nugs be more popcorn 🍿 but figured I'd still try it out. Harvest and packaged recently too. Smoked a whole joint and I can definitely feel the linalool kicking in and my body feels great. Feel super relaxed but not couch locked. I'd say it was a good pick up overall and would recommend. 👌",

He recommended Bazookas. This product hit me like a freight train. It has very, very fast onset. Pain was gone, and it has that whole body warm blanket feeling. The last thing I remember was lying in bed so relaxed and happy and high.\n\nOpening the tub I was instantly hit with an intense aroma full of diesel, candy, and lemon. It has such a very unique distinct pungency to it, sort of reminds me of lingering cat urine smell lol, but damn it stank out my house so much that my wife who doesn’t use had to go to another room. This morning, she asked me to move the tub into the garage as she could still smell it haha.\n\nDoing some research into Ostara Medical, one of their strains Grape Stank just won the Karma Cup, which looks like a fairly prestigious consumer lead competition. I also looked on this sub and there are some mixed reviews about Bazookas in the last few months. This batch 000326 appear to be released in the last couple of weeks, which makes sense based on the expiry date.\n\nThe diesel and candy translated straight through to the flavour. The buds are sticky, very demse and cured very well. I got a massive nug in my jar, which has broken apart with some pretty gentle handling, I think the nodes are quite fragile, so I’ve been left with some smaller buds. This is the only negative thing I would say at this point.\n\n For me I rate this as some of the best MC I’ve had for pain and sleep, Could be the best but I’ll keep trying for another week. I’d rate this 9.5 out of 10. I’d give it a 10 if it was in glass.\n\n ",

    "body": "Hey everyone! Before I got super busy with my new job, I used to regularly post reviews over on r/AsianBeauty. I really enjoyed that process, and now that things have mellowed out a bit for me, I wanted to start doing the same here. \n\nI generally try to review products that I don't see too often on skincare subs. Past reviews have included [Missha Near Skin Madecanol Cream] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/87r241/review_missha_near_skin_madecanol_cream/), [Missha Near Skin Total Ceramide Cream] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/82f8h9/review_missha_near_skin_total_ceramide_cream/), [Missha Near Skin Phyto Azulen Cream] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8cejd0/review_missha_near_skin_phyto_azulen_cream/), [Tosowoong Apricot Seed Cleansing Oil] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/7u2j65/review_tosowoong_apricot_seed_cleansing_oil/), and [Benton Honest TT Mist] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/7trt3u/review_benton_honest_tt_mist/). Today I wanted to review one of my favorite masks: The Body Shop Ginseng and Rice Polishing and Clarifying Mask. \n\nI hope you enjoy the review, and as always, please feel free to leave questions and feedback!\n\n**The Body Shop Chinese Ginseng and Rice Clarifying and Polishing Mask**\n\nI *love* masks. Like seriously **love** them. And as much as I enjoy a good sheet mask, there's still something about a nice wash-off mask that feels like you're really pampering yourself. I still have very high expectations for my wash-off masks though...they can't just feel nice. I also expect them to address my skin concerns, which are mainly acne, PIE, and dryness/dehydration. \n\nI spotted this particular mask in someone's shelfie over on ScA, and hadn't heard of it before, so I popped into the Body Shop one day to have a look. I was a bit hesitant to try it, as I was worried it might be too drying. It's ended up being one of my favorite products, and I'm so glad I took the risk. \n\n**Packaging:** This product comes in a 3oz/75ml dark brown glass jar with a black plastic lid. It's surprisingly heavy for its size, but has proven fairly durable...the lid has stayed intact for as long as I've had it, and while I haven't dropped it, the jar did survive an international move with no problems. Aesthetically, it's apothecary/minimal, so if you're into Aesop's vibe, you'll probably like this too. I know not everyone is keen on jar packaging, but I personally don't mind it. \n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nThe star ingredients in this mask are kaolin, salicylic acid, ginseng, and rice extract. The first two are acne-fighters; kaolin is a type of clay that's known for being less drying than other types of clay while still providing similar acne-fighting, pore-reducing benefits. And we all know salicylic acid as everyone's favorite BHA. While the percentage isn't listed, it's high enough on the ingredients list that I'd estimate (very unscientifically) it's somewhere in the 1% range, and expect to see an impact. Rice bran extract is an emollient ingredient ([source] (https://cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/oryza-sativa-rice-extract)) but in its powdered form, can be a mild exfoliant. I'm not sure which form it's used in here, but given the slightly grainy texture of the mask, I'd expect it's powdered, and is acting as an exfoliant rather than an emollient. Ginseng is touted for its anti-aging benefits, and has been shown to act as an antioxidant, have an anti-inflammatory effect, and stimulate blood flow to give you a bit of a glow ([source] (https://www.refinery29.com/42123). Beeswax and shea butter in the ingredients list also made me a bit more optimistic when considering the product--it seems like there was definitely some thought that went into making this a clarifying product that still wouldn't strip dry skin too much. \n\nThat's the good stuff. However, there are a lot of potentially sensitizing ingredients in there. Denatured alcohol features pretty high on the ingredients list. I personally don't have issues with alcohol in skincare, but it's something to watch for those who do. Fragrance is also higher on the list than I'd generally like, so those who are sensitive to fragrance, beware. There are also some fatty alcohols, as well as limonene, and linalool. If you have especially sensitive skin, this product is probably not for you.\n\nThe full ingredients list is:\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Glycerin, Luffa Cylindrica Fruit, Kaolin, Sesamum Indicum Seed Oil/Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, PEG-100 Stearate, Alcohol Denat., Decyl Glucoside, Cera Alba/Beeswax/Cire d’abeille, Perlite, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter/Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter,Parfum/Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Limonene, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Myristyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Menthol, Panax Ginseng Root Extract/Panax Ginseng (Ginseng) Root Extract, Disodium EDTA, Citral, Citronellol, Linalool, Menthoxypropanediol, Tetrasodium Pyrophosphate, Eugenol, Dextrin, Oryza Sativa Extract/Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, CI 77891/Titanium Dioxide.\n\n**Price:** I bought mine in the UK for £17; it retails for $28 in the US, but The Body Shop often runs sales and 3 for 2 deals. \n\n**Use and Performance:**\n\nLike I mentioned when talking about the ingredients, this is a clarifying mask that seems to have been formulated with dry skin in mind. This is very clearly reflected in the texture of the mask. It's far creamier than your typical clay mask, and doesn't dry down as completely. The mask itself is an off-white colour, and the creamy clay consistency also includes a grainy element (most likely from the rice). It smells very strongly of ginseng, which I love. You apply this like you would any other clay mask--spread a thin layer over your face using your fingers or a brush, then wait 15-20 minutes for the mask to dry down, and then rinse it off. \n\nI don't find that this mask dries down as aggressively as other clay masks I've tried, and I don't feel like my face is about to crack at the end of 20 minutes. I usually prefer to wash this mask off in the shower, because it can be a bit difficult to wash it off cleanly without making a total mess--consider yourself warned! My face does feel a bit tight afterwards, but it's nothing that a few layers of Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion and Scinic Honey AIO can't fix. \n\nI see instant results from this mask. My pores immediately look smaller, and my skin has much more of a glow. If I use it at night, I wake up the next morning with a significant reduction in my acne. I also find it reduces my PIE, which was something I wasn't expecting! I use this mask once a week, or twice a week if my skin is especially congested, and I find that it clears up any random acne or texture issues that I'm dealing with. \n\n**Final Thoughts:** This is a really great mask option for someone who needs an occasional serious acne-fighter, but is also worried about dryness. Oilier skin types may be able to use the mask more often than dryer skin types. It's definitely not a one-stop miracle acne product...I rely on Differin (currently, previously Skinoren) to keep my acne under control in the long-term, and use this mask to address random breakouts and congestion. It's also probably not great for more sensitive skin types, I'm sorry to say. And if you're dehydrated, you'll probably want to steer clear as well--clay and salicylic acid won't do your moisture barrier any good!\n\nOverall, it's a very effective, pleasant to use mask that I consider a holy grail, and will continue to repurchase for as long as I can. \n\n**My Rating: 5/5**\n\n",

    "body": "RRP Price: $165.\n\nSize: 10g.\n\nPer MG: $0.06.\n\nOrigin: British Columbia, Canada. \n\nCultivator: VALHALLA FLWR.\n\nPlant Species: Balanced Hybrid. \n\nTHC: 28%.\n\nCBD: <1%.\n\nLineage: Jungle Lava x Rainbow Kush\n\nTotal Terpenes: 2.92%\nDominant Terpenes: Cedrene (0.67%), Limonene (0.55%), Linalool (0.42%) & Humulene (0.26%), Myrcene (0.25%).\n\nlet’s start with the Visuals, the box it comes in. The colour is mainly white giving it that fresh clean look with Rainbow Like lava Text in multicolours, presents the strain nicely nothing to much but some art is nice. \n\nI Opened up the box to the Glass jar, gave it a smell and I will say the first Initial smell was quite nice, not too pungent but a nice soft fruity sherbet smell with undertones of Earth and Wood. The flower itself was very vibrant, with deep purples, orange pistols and some bright green hues. 80% of the flower was somewhat sticky, it wasn’t moist to my liking as the Terpenes could have stood out allot more but it definitely wasn’t dry. Grinding up made my fingers sticky making me need to wash them. \n\nSet the Taroma Lite Plus Ball Vape to 515, letting the titanium bowl heat soak soon as it hits 508 I start slowly pulling gently increasing the pull creating more vapour. I get a nice thick cloud with a light flavour of Fruity (Citrus) Sherbet, on the second hit I could more taste the cloves and earthy flavour. After 2 bowls I definitely felt more of a relaxed feeling, for a balanced hybrid I think it may lean towards the indica side for sure. \n\nCedrene is the first terpene which is known to help with pain relief, anti-inflammatory, anti-anxiety… Studies indicate that cedrene may also trigger cell death and destroy certain human cancer cells related to lung, liver and oral cancers. I definitely felt the pain relief almost like someone rubbed a pain relief cream on me but that was about it with that terpene. Next terpene is Limonene which I found provided a nice mental energetic flow nothing that gave me energy nor kept me focused doing what I was doing. Linalool I found helped with starting to relax my body and when mixed with Woodford I found linalool helps enhance sleep quality so it’s good for a terp mix. \n\nHumulene the second to last terp I found helped with inflammation as I’m still recovering from a dislocated elbow and still have some swelling and pain which I do find helps allot with keeping my arm from being inflamed. It also helps with appetite control which I surprisingly did find I wasn’t as hungry after but with all good flower you get hungry anyway. \n\nFor the Price and Quality of the other SingleEstate products I wished this was a little less dry so the flavours came through allot more, I wasn’t a big fan of the Wood/Earth/Clove Aroma/Flavour but that’s a personal preference to keep in mind for next time. Other than that the effects was very nice and balanced, just slightly leaning towards being an afternoon strain to get ready for night time. Good pain relief and a mental focused high which slowly came to an end with more relaxation. But definitely can be had in the day. I would give this an 8/10.",
