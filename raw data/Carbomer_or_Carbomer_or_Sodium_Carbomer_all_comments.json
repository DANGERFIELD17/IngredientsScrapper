    "body": "\nNgayong araw i-rereview ko ang Hikari Ultrawhite Sunscreen. Bago pa na-i-launch yung tinted sunscreen ng same brand, sobrang hype nito sa Tiktok, at marami na ding mga content creators sa Tiktok ang nakapagreview dito. Magbabahagi lamang ako dito ng point of view ko bilang isang cosmetic chemist at titingnan at magkukumento ako sa mga technical na detalye na nakapaloob dito sa produkto na ito. \n\nBago ang lahat, binili ko itong product sa legitimate na distributor ng brand sa Tiktok. Marami na kasi akong napanuod na videos nung CEO ng brand na kung saan sinabi nya na pinepeke daw ang product na ito. Gusto ko lang na lehitimong product ang gagawan ko ng review. Saktong sakto din na fresh batch yung dumating kong order, dahil kita naman sa batch code nito na nitong April 2025 lang ito na-produce. \n\nPagkabukas ko pa lamang ng product, ang unang bumungad sa akin ay ang fragrance nito. May kalakasan ang fragrance nito na may floral at milky scent. Maaring di akma ang produkto na ito sa mga end user na may sensitivity sa mga fragrance. \n\nSunod kong napansin ay yung kulay nito. Makikita nyo sa pic na kulay pink itong product. Mahalaga itong property na ito ng sunscreen kaya balikan ko ito mamaya. \n\nKapag inilagay na sa daliri yung product para sukatin ito bago ipahid sa balat, napansin ko na medyo nagtutubig or nagiging runny. Babalikan ko din ito mamaya pagdating natin sa analysis ng ingredient list nitong product. \n\nKapag ipinahid na ito sa balat, lightweight naman ang texture nito. Madaling ma-blend at walang white cast, na ok para sa moreno kong balat. Wala din akong napansin na pilling o paglilibag during application nitong sunscreen. So far, so good. \n\nNgayon, tumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list:\n\nAqua, Glycerin, Octyl, Methoxycinnamate, Dimethicone, Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Leaf Extract, Hyaluronic Acid, Polypodium Extract, Baicalin (Scutellaria Root Extract), Phenoxyethanol, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Carbomer 940 & Fragrance\n\nKung nabasa nyo na yung previous review ko sa Hikari Premium Sun Perfect Tinted Sunscreen Broad Spectrum, lahat ng typographic errors  at maling INCI name ng ingredient na nasa ingredient list ay nandito din sa Hikari Ultrawhite Sunscreen. Ang kinaibahan lang, yung tinted, may Niacinamide at Vitamin E. \n\nNgayon, balikan natin yung kulay nitong sunscreen na ito. Sa ingredient list, wala akong makita na ingredient na naging dahilan kung bakit naging kulay pink itong sunscreen. Walang colorant na ginamit. Sa mga nakalistang ingredients, walang isa jan ang kulay pink. So kung ano man ang nakakapagpa-pink jan ay hindi nakadeclare. Bakit kaya? \n\nBalikan naman natin yung napansin ko na nagtutubig yung product kapag in-contact na sa daliri. Marami akong nakitang users na sa Tiktok na nagtataka bakit daw watery or nagtutubig yung sunscreen. Dahil yan sa carbomer (ito ang tamang INCI names hindi  Carbomer 940). Ano ba itong carbomer na ito? Itong ingredient na ito, kapag ihinalo sa tubig at inadjust ang pH sa 5-7, pinalalapot nito ang tubig at nagiging gel. Ito gel na ito ay inherently na nagbe-break kapag ito ay napadikit o nalagyan ng ions. And since sagana ang ating balat sa ions (mula sa pawis, at naiiwan sa balat kahit natuyuan na ng pawis), expected talaga na magbe-break yung gel at magtutubig. \n\nNabanggit ko na din lamang na kailangang i-adjust ang pH ng tubig na may carbomer para lumapot, bakit kaya hindi nakalista sa ingredient list yung mga neutralizing agents (halimbawa: sodium hydroxide, triethanolamine) na normal namang ginagamit kapag may carbomer sa formulation? Napansin  ko din ito dun sa tinted version ng sunscreen ng Hikari. \n\nIsa pang napansin ko sa magkaparehong sunscreen ng Hikari, bakit hindi nakalista yung emulsifier na ginamit? Papaanong nabuo itong gel cream na ito kung walang emulsifier? Kasi kung walang emulsifier sa mga sunscreen na binanggit ko, hindi mabubuo at maghihiwalay lang yung water at oil phase ng mga unscreen na yan. Baka naman meron, pero di lang inilista? Kung meron man, dapat nakadeklara yan, alinsunod sa Cosmetic Labelling Requirements ng ASEAN Cosmetic Directive. This applies din dun sa mga nauna kong binanggit (yung nagpapapink dito sa sunscreen, at yung neutralizing agent na ginamit para sa carbomer). Paano kaya to nakalusot sa FDA? \n\nNgayon punta naman tayo sa mga product claims nito na may concern ako:\n\n* UVA/UVB SPF 50 PA++++\n* Non-comodogenic\n* Repairs sun damage\n\nItong sunscreen na ito ay gumagamit ng tatlong UV filters:\n\n* Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (ganito ang tamang INCI name) \n* Zinc Oxide\n* Titanium Dioxide\n\nAng Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate at Titanium Dioxide ay parehong UVB filters, samantalang ang Zinc Oxide naman ay UVA/UVB filter. Ang tanong ko lang, papaanong pumalo ng SPF 50 ang rating nito at may PA++++ rating pa, samantalang mas mababa pa ang concentration ng zinc oxide at titanium dioxide sa phenoxyethanol? Assuming na isinagad sa 1% yung phenoxyethanol, ibig sabihin nito, mababa pa sa 1% yung zinc oxide at titanium dioxide. Papaanong papalo yan ng SPF 50 at magkakaroon ng PA++++ sa ganyang kababang amount? Napapaisip tuloy ako kung SPF tested ba talaga to. May pinakita na bang SPF test result para sa sunscreen na ito, pati na din dun sa tinted? Kasi diba ganun ang uso sa mga local brand owner ng sunscreen, kanya kanyang lapag ng SPF test report as part of their marketing? \n\nDoon naman sa NON-COMODOGENIC, please lang, uso ang mag proof-read bago mag-approve ng packaging layout ha. Kasimple-simple e. \n\nSa claim na \"Repairs sun damage\", bawal yang claim na yan dahil ini-imply na may physiological effect (repair sun damage) ang sunscreen na yan, na dapat wala, dahil iyan ay isang cosmetic product. Yung mga claims na ganyan na may physiological effect e papasok na sa drug category, at hindi na sa cosmetics. Paano kaya nakalusot to sa FDA? \n\nFinal words:\nMula sa formulation, claims, at ingredient list, napansin ko na ang daming problema nitong product na ito (maging yung tinted version nito). Sana naman e ma-review ito ng brand owner para ma-address yung mga punto na nabanggit ko dito. \n\nSa FDA naman, wag naman sana basta-basta approve ng approve ng CPN ng mga cosmetic products ng hindi na-a-assess ng maayos. Kaya bumababa ang kumpiyansa ng mga tao sa locally produced cosmetics e.\n\nAyun lang, maraming salamat sa pagbabasa. ",

    "body": "Hey everyone! Due to a recent posting of misinformation being spread on here, excessive worrying over ingredients, and people PMing me for advice I figured I would just make a post about this to help other people with similar questions\n\nFor background, I am a chemist- in particular a biochemist. I used to work in a research area that focused on mineral/ion- skin absorption. I'll try to hit the ones that aren't in the side bar already and separate them out by category for easy viewing. Let me know if I missed any big ones!\n\n**Emulsifiers - keep oil/water based chemicals from separating in products**\n\nMost common products I see contain polysorbates, laureth-4, glyceryl monostearate (also pearlescent agent)\nlauramide DEA (also foam booster), or potassium cetyl sulfate. There's also stearic acid that also helps with cleansing. These aren't necessarily bad for you nor are they good for you. They're kinda meh ingredients that exist to make the product work \n\n**Preservatives- extend their shelf life and are anti microbial**\n \nparabens- these get a lot of flack but there isn't that much research confirming their 'toxicity'. The [original study] (http://www.dr-baumann.ca/science/Concentrations%20of%20Parabens%20in%20Human%20Breast.pdf) that brought them into the spotlight was over hyped by the media and dozens of other studies done afterwards have yet to find a definite link to cancer or other diseases. These are however very great preservatives\n\nBenzyl alcohol containing products has been known to dry some people out due to it's status as an alcohol. Aside from a preservative it's also used as a ph balancer\n\nformaldehyde- if you see this in a product, you may want to be wary. The World Health Organization has determined this to be a carcinogen; however whether trace amounts are as bad for you is still unknown\n\n tetrasodium EDTA/ disodium EDTA- normally these are used to draw metals out of the blood, but in terms of skincare, both work to stabilize the product by binding other chemicals. Only concern with this one is that it's an environmental hazard \n\nPhenoxyethanol -  an antimicrobial \n\nethylhexylglycerin - helps with eczema and also works for some people with rosacea \n\n**Moisturizers : Lipid thickeners - give product it's creamy consistency**\n\ncetyl alcohol, stearic acid and carnauba wax are the big ones- aren't bad, rarely cause things like breakouts for most people. These are also good at protecting the moisture barrier from water loss by forming a 'seal' \n\n**Moisturizers : Natural thickeners - come from nature, usually work as humectants (think hyaluronic acid)**\n\nhydroxyethyl cellulose, guar gum, xanthan gum and gelatin are the most popular\n\n**Moisturizers: Mineral thickeners - also natural, absorb both oils and retain water**\n\nmagnesium aluminium silicate, silica and bentonite are the big ones here. A lot of clay masks and some silicone based (neutrogena) sunscreens are apart of this category. Silicone based sunscreens are great for those who's skin can handle them since they keep oils/shine in check while also preventing your skin from overdrying\n\n**Moisturizers: synthetic thickeners - used in a lot of gel type products and some of the rich/smooth white creams**\n\ncarbomer, cetyl palmitate, and ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate are common ones\n\n**Emollients - soften the skin by preventing water loss, work as humectants,  definetly want these in your routine**\n\nbeeswax, olive oil, coconut oil and lanolin, petroleum jelly, mineral oil, glycerin, zinc oxide, butyl stearate and diglycol laurate , urea, glycerol, propylene glycol or lactic acid are big ones here.\n\nSome of these are termed 'comedogenic' like coconut oil but many many people don't break out from them so that's a pretty arbitrary rating imo\n\n**Edit- here’s a couple more I forgot to add that are sunscreen relevant**\n\n**Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate-** protects against UVB and not UVA rays. It is not very stable either, when exposed to sunlight, it kind of breaks down and loses its effectiveness (not instantly, but over time - it loses 10% of its SPF protection ability within 35 mins)\n\n**Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane-**  famous Avobenzone. It is the only globally available chemical sunscreen agent that protects against UVA. It is the global gold standard of UVA protection and is the most used UVA sunscreen in the world. Suprisingly it’s in moisturizers too.The problem with it, though, is that it is not photostable and degrades in the sunlight. Wikipedia says that avobenzone loses 36% of its UV-absorption capacity after just one hour of sunlight",

    "body": "I've copy/pasted this text multiple times now and decided to just make a separate post about it (and I admit I want to be lazy and just post a link instead of repeatedly copy/pasting a comment). Some of you may recognize a good portion of this, but I've added some points because I'm trying to make this post as comprehensive as possible.\n\nIn order to determine whether a product is water-based or silicone-based, you have to look at the ingredients. -Cone/-methicone, and -siloxane words near the top of the list tend to signal a silicone-based product. Water will be at the top of the list for any liquid product because water makes it liquidy. It doesn't mean that a product is water-based. Without water, the product would not be spreadable/blendable. For example:\n\nMAKE UP FOR EVER HD Microperfecting Primer Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Aqua (Water), **Dimethicone**, **Trisiloxane**, PEG-12 **Dimethicone**, **Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone** Crosspolymer, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Squalane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18 Methicone, Phenoxyethanol, Ceteth-10, Laureth-4, Ethylglycerin, Panthenol, Potassium Sorbate, Polysorbate 60, Parfum (Fragrance), Argania Spinosa Extract (Argania Spinosa Kernel Extract), C12-14 Pareth-12, Hydrolyzed Algin, Dodecene, Sorbitan Isostearate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Tromethamine, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. [CI 19140 (Yellow 5 Lake), CI 75470 (Carmine), CI 77007 (Ultramarines), CI 77288 (Chromium Oxide Greens), CI 77289 (Chromium Hydroxide Green), CI 77491 (Iron Oxides), CI 77492 (Iron Oxides), CI 77499 (Iron Oxides), CI 77742 (Manganese Violet), CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide)].\n\nSee the bold words? Definitely silicone-based! Again, the water keeps it a more liquid-y consistency so it's easily spreadable. It doesn't mean that the product is water-based. Particularly with primers, I can always tell because it has that \"silicone\" feeling. Now let's look at a water-based primer:\n\nLaura Mercier Foundation Primer - Oil Free Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Isodecyl Isononanoate, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, C22-20 Alcohols, Squalane, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Esters, Phenoxyethanol, Boron Nitride, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin Tocopherol Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hamaelis Viginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Cucumis sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Retinyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Polyamino Sugar Condesate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Chlorphensin, Benzoic Acid, Polysorbate 60, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Saccharomyces/Xylium Black Tea Ferment, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Potassium Sorbate, Green 5 (CI 61570), Yellow 5 (CI 19140).\n\nSee how there are no -cone/-methicone or -siloxane words near the top of the list? That means that it's water-based. This primer does contain dimethicone, which is a silicone, but it's relatively low on the list, which means that it contains a very small amount of silicone (ingredients are typically listed in order, beginning with what is in there most and ending with what is in there the least). Thus, because this primer contains much more water (and other ingredients) than silicone, it is water-based.\n\nOil-based foundations are exceptionally rare. After much searching, I finally found one: Alexandra de Markoff Countess Isserlyn Cream Makeup (another is NARS Balanced Foundation, which has been discontinued, so I could not find an easily copy/paste-able ingredients list). Let's look at the ingredients:\n\nWater (aqua), **Decyl Oleate**, **Lanolin Oil**, Propylene Glycol, Talc, Isotearic Acid, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetyl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Fragrance (parfum), Emulsifying Wax NF, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, PPG-12-PEG-65 Lanolin Oil, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben. May contain Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI77492, CI 77499, Ultramarines (CI77007)\n\nYes, water is listed as the first ingredient, but that is to keep the product more blendable. The second and third ingredients (in bold) are definitely oils. Phew! You don't know how many ingredients lists I went through to find that! I swear unicorns are easier to find! ANYWAY, they should play well with silicone-based primers. However, this is unlikely to be of concern to you because chances are you're not using an oil-based foundation (if you are using an oil-based foundation, check your closet for a herd of unicorns).\n\nIn general, you want water-based primers with water-based foundations (or tinted moisturizers, BB creams, CC creams, concealer, or any other base products; I'm just going to keep typing \"foundations\" for the sake of brevity), and silicone-based primers with silicone-based foundations. The two different bases (water and silicone) can cause your foundation to pill when layered on top of each other. In particular, using a silicone-based primer with a water-based foundation on top of it often causes the foundation to pill because the primer creates a silicone barrier. When you try to apply a water-based foundation on top of that, the silicone repels the water in the foundation, and the water in the foundation does not absorb properly into your skin, resulting in unevenness.\n\nPlease remember to moisturize well underneath your makeup (and to give your moisturizer time to absorb fully, meaning your skin should no longer have that \"tacky\" feeling that you have right after applying moisturizer). If you use sunscreen (which you should, especially with summer coming up), you need to let that absorb as well. The base of your moisturizer/sunscreen is irrelevant, because if you allow them to absorb completely, they will not affect makeup application at all. If you begin applying primer and foundation before your moisturizer and/or sunscreen has fully absorbed, they can cause your makeup to break up sooner, which is the opposite of what you want.\n\nAlong the same line, your powder is irrelevant to the base of your foundation/primer. There is no such thing as a water-based powder (it then wouldn't be a powder). If your powder isn't working with your foundation/primer and giving you the look that you want, it is not related to the base of your foundation/primer. Also, not everybody needs to use powder on top of their foundation, so if you're not liking the look, you may consider skipping powder altogether.\n\nAdditionally, you only need a small amount of primer for your face (a very thin layer is sufficient... your face should not feel too slippery). Do not apply too much primer. Water-based primers will absorb into your skin better, but silicone-based primers tend to sit on top of it. Using too much will create a slick film that causes your foundation to slide off much sooner. Remember that it is easier to add more (and I recommend that you add more gradually, little by little) than to take primer off of your face. Over time, you'll get used to the amount you need for your face.\n\nWhile pore-filling primers, such as Benefit Porefessional, NYX Pore Filler, and Too Faced Primed and Poreless, are designed specifically to fill in your visible pores, you can also use any primer to do this (though in my experience, they do not do as well at filling in pores as pore-filling primers, and silicone-based primers work best for filling in pores). Just make sure that you tap the primer into your pores rather than rubbing. Tapping gets the product into your pores to fill them in. Rubbing does not do the same (though you can rub afterward to make sure the surface is smoothed out) and will not give you the same pore-filling results.\n\nFinally, please remember that just because you are using two products with the same base, it doesn't necessarily mean that the products will work for you. Not every product works for every person. You may need to experiment to find the right combination for you. I highly recommend asking for samples, as they are a much cheaper (i.e. FREE) method of trying out a product. You can ask for samples of any product that can be sanitized and put in a small sample jar, such as primer and foundation.\n\nI hope this post has been helpful.

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

While you might have had a bad experience, using acids with retinol will NOT cause more breakouts as you erroneously suggested, and on the contrary many dermatologists recommend using benzoyl peroxide in conjunction with retinols to stave off purging and help acne heal faster. You can say be careful using acids, but speaking so definitively about something that is completely not true and unfounded (especially about it somehow causing more breakouts) is something that needs to be editing or removed.",

Has \"great skin moisturising properties\" according to [Incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dipropylene-glycol). Safety rating of 1-2 (very safe) on [Cosdna](https://www.cosdna.com/eng/b05d771602.html). This is likely nothing to worry about unless you already know you have a sensitivity, as it is mostly there to keep the formula feeling elegant and seems to be mildly hydrating. \n\n//\n\nHYALURONIC ACID FERMENT FILTRATE \n\nNew kind of hyaluronic acid that Hada Labo claims will \"help fortify the skins moisture barrier to help skin looking plump and supple\". This is the most controversial addition as many people are sensitive to ferments and this product will unfortunately now be unsuitable for them, which is a real shame. However, if you are someone who enjoys ferments, this might sound rather exciting. I couldn't find much info when I searched \"fermented hyaluronic acid\", but Ratzilla's list seems to suggest that the HA has been fermented with Lactococcus bacteria, which is proposed to \"positively influence both the speed and quality of epidermal growth, resulting in better barrier function and overall skin quality\" ([Incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/lactococcus-ferment-lysate)). I'm not convinced a difference in effect will be extremely noticeable alongside the 6 other kinds of HA but I expect it will work well for plumping and improving the health and appearance of the skin regardless. \n\n//\n\nHYDROLIZED SODIUM HYALURONATE \n\nThis is a super, super tiny (low molecular weight) version of hyaluronic acid, which is intended to penetrate even deeper into the skin and moisturise deeper than standard HA. If your skin wasn't bothered by the Hydrolized hyaluronic acid (another smaller molecule form) in the original formula (still in this one too!) then you might well not be bothered by this version too. Source: [incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-sodium-hyaluronate)\n\n//\n\nPROPANEDIOL \n\nCommonly used solvent, humectant and emollient. In short, makes formulas more cosmetically elegant and also helps to pull moisture into the skin and keep it there. Considered very safe and a non-irritant. Further reading: [byrdie article](https://www.byrdie.com/propanediol-for-skin-4773491) [paula's choice ](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/uncategorized/propanediol.html)\n\n//\n\nCAPRYLHYDROXAMIC ACID \n\nAn anti-fungal amino acid derived from coconut oil that acts as a preservative. Limited data regarding safety, but Honest Beauty claims it is safer and less harsh than other commonly used preservatives (take this with a grain of salt as Honest Beauty has an agenda to push and so will be biased). Sources: [truth in ageing ](https://www.truthinaging.com/ingredients/caprylhydroxamic-acid)\n[honest beauty ](https://www.honest.com/blog/wellness/ingredients/what-is-caprylhydroxamic-acid/13775.html)\n\n//\n\nHYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE \n\nUsed as a thickener in cosmetics, gives a nice slippy, gel-like feeling. Water soluble, regarded as safe. \n\n//\n\nXANTHAN GUM \n\nExtremely commonly used thickener and stabiliser. Unlikely to be an issue unless you have a specific sensitivity to it. \n\n\n//\n\nAnd now, let's look at the changes in the top few ingredients: \n\n• The top ingredients, which I usually regard as the most important, have changed in that normal Glycerin has been removed and replaced with Diglycerin, and it's now the 7th ingredient as opposed to the 3rd. Diglycerin is not much different as both are powerful hydrators, but Diglycerin supposedly \"penetrates slower into the skin but gives longer lasting moisture and less sticky, better skin-feel.\" Source: [incidecoder ](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/diglycerin) This might be good for people who have tried the original Premium and found it to be too sticky on the skin! However, due to it being moved lower down, the impact might not be too obvious here. \n\n• Pentylene Glycol has been bumped way up the list from 16th to 4th! This is another thickening ingredient that is key to the sensory feeling of the product, and according to incidecoder its also a moisturiser and helps to hydrate and smooth the skin. However, [the derm review ](https://thedermreview.com/pentylene-glycol/) actually claims it doesn't have any specific skin benefits, but is at least safe and non-irritating. I personally would rather have kept a higher concentration of glycerin or diglycerin in the product as opposed to this as I think they're more intensely moisturising/hydrating to the skin. \n\n• On the other hand, urea has been moved from the 5th ingredient to the 3rd, where glycerin was previously. From [incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethyl-urea): \"A derivative of Urea, that works as a strong moisturizer and humectant meaning that it helps the skin to cling onto water and thus to make it hydrated and elastic.\n\nAccording to manufacturer's data,  Hydroxyethyl Urea has a similar moisturizing ability to glycerin (measured at 5%), but it feels nicer on the skin as it is non-sticky and non-tacky and gives a lubricous and moist feeling to the skin.\" \n\nSo, perhaps this formulation could actually remain equally as hydrating, if not more so, but less sticky due to the removal of glycerin? \n\n//\n\nTLDR: \n\nSo, apart from the ferment all the new additions are commonly used ingredients - nothing toxic, irritating or comodegenic! In theory (best case scenario) it should be even more hydrating due to the extra two forms of hyaluronic acid, and potentially less sticky due to the removal of glycerin and higher concentrations of urea and Diglycerin! Worst case scenario is that the concentrations of HA have been lowered and it won't have the same deeply plumping effect, only time will tell. \n\nThis is getting very long and my thumbs are tired so I'm going to end this post here even though I could potentially go on, hopefully this helps some people make an informed decision on whether they'd like to try the new formulation. I personally have already ordered a bottle as I'm not concerned by the addition of ferments and in general it doesn't look bad at all. Fingers crossed it's somehow even better than the original!!",

    "body": "I know CeraVe in the tub is quite popular here, but I just wanted to provide a quick overview of other CeraVe moisturizers for those who aren't familiar.\n\n**NOTE**: All CeraVe moisturizers contain cetearyl alcohol/cetyl alcohol, which may cause breakouts to those who have a sensitivity to fatty alcohols.\n\n**Cerave Moisturizer Overview**\n\n[**Cerave Moisturizing Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/moisturizing-cream) (also known as Cerave \"in the tub\") is a thick, creamy moisturizer with ceramides, hyaluronic acid and petrolatum.\n\n[**Cerave Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/moisturizing-lotion) comes in a bottle and is a thinner consistency. It also has ceramides and hyaluronic acid but no petrolatum.\n\n[**Cerave AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/am-facial-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a small pump bottle and has a thick, creamy (slightly greasy) texture. It is SPF 30 and contains the following active suncare ingredients: Homosalate (12% - for UVB protection), Octinoxate (7.5% - for UVB protection), Octocrylene (2% - for UVB protection), Zinc Oxide (3.5% - for UVA protection). It also contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/pm-facial-moisturizing-lotion) (my fave) comes in a small pump bottle and is a silky/gel texture. It contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and places more focus on chemical exfoliation. Notable ingredients are mineral oil, ammonium lactate (similar to lactic acid), salicyclic acid, ceramides and a lower concentration of hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-cream) comes in a tub and is a thicker version of the SA lotion and contains similar ingredients with the addition of niacinamide.\n\n[**Cerave Skin Renewing Night Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/skin-renewing-night-cream) comes in a tub and contains shea butter, ceramides, niacinamide, peptides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and contains niacinamide, ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and allantoin (an anti-irritant derived from urea). \n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-cream) comes in a tub and contains glycerin, petrolatum, ceramides and hyaluronic acid. No niacinamide or allantoin in this one.\n\n**Notable Ingredient Overview**\n\n**Ceramides**: Naturally occurring, long chains of skin lipids (fats) that are major structural components of the skin’s outer layers. Skin as a barrier system inhibits water movement via its extracellular matrix, which has a unique composition of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% free fatty acids. Together, these lipids form what researchers refer to as \"crystalline lamellar structures\". Ceramides are necessary for the skin’s water-retention capacity as well as for barrier repair and cell regulation. Adding ceramides to skin-care products can help to restore the skin’s barrier system.\n\n**Hyaluronic acid**: Component of skin tissue that is used in skin-care products as a good skin-identical ingredient. Hyaluronic acid can boost skin's moisture content, reduce inflammation, have cell-communicating abilities, and help prevent moisture loss.\n\n**Niacinamide**: Also known as vitamin B3 and nicotinic acid, niacinamide is a potent cell-communicating ingredient that offers multiple benefits for aging skin. Assuming skin is being protected from sun exposure, niacinamide can improve skin's elasticity, dramatically enhance its barrier function, help erase discolorations, and revive skin's healthy tone and texture.\n\n**Ammonium Lactate:** Ammonium lactate is a mix of lactic acid and ammonium hydroxide. It is used as a skin moisturizer lotion to treat dry, scaly, itchy skin. Those who are using it should avoid exposure to sunlight or artificial UV rays, such as sunlamps or tanning beds. Ammonium lactate makes skin more sensitive to sunlight. Skin is more likely to sunburn. Use sunblock and wear clothes when exposed to sunlight.\n\n**Salicylic acid**: Referred to as beta hydroxy acid (BHA), it is a multifunctional ingredient that addresses many of the systemic causes of blemishes. For decades dermatologists have been prescribing salicylic acid as an exceedingly effective keratolytic (exfoliant), but it also is an anti-irritant This is because salicylic acid is a derivative of aspirin (both are salicylates—aspirin’s technical name is acetylsalicylic acid), and so it also functions as an anti-inflammatory.\n\n**Shea butter**: A plant lipid extracted from the karite tree that is used as an emollient in cosmetics. Shea butter is a rich source of antioxidants.\n\n**Ingredient Lists**\n\n> **CeraVe Moisturizing Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n>\n> **CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Active Ingredients: Homosalate (12%), Octinoxate (7.5%), Octocrylene (2%), Zinc Oxide (3.5%). \n> Inactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate and Boron Nitride, Dimethicone, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Hyaluronic Acid, Phytosphingosine, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n> \n> **CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Renewing SA Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Mineral Oil, Ammonium Lactate, Salicylic Acid, Trolamine, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 in Corn Oil), Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Dimethicone 360, Methylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Propylparaben, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Renewing SA Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ammonium Lactate, Salicylic Acid, Triethanolamine, Cetyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 in Corn Oil), Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Methylparaben, Edetate Disodium, Propylparaben, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Glyceryl stearate SE, Stearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Saccharide Isomerate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterols, Ceramide 6 II, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 1, Niacinamide, Hyaluronic  Acid, Caprooyl Tetrapeptide-3, Tripeptide-1, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Tocopherol, Allantoin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Phytosphingosine, Dextran, Xanthan Gum\n>\n>**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n>\n>Purified Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetostearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Emulsifying Wax, Niacinamide, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lauric Acid, Zinc Citrate, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Arginine PCA, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, EDTA, Sodium PCA, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer\n>\n>**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**\n>\n>Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Petrolatum, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nHopefully this information will be useful to people interested in trying Cerave.",

    "body": "Gusto ko lang i-share yung review ko tungkol sa product na ito dahil sobra ang hype nito sa Tiktok. Nakabili ako nito nung nag live selling nito yung dalawang sikat na content creators sa Tiktok: Skincarebyruzz at Wearsunscreen.\n\nTingnan muna natin ang ingredient list nitong sunscreen (pwede din tingnan sa pic na nasa itaas):\n\nAqua, Glycerin, Octyl, Methoxycinnamate, Dimethicone, Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Leaf Extract, Hyaluronic Acid, Polypodium Leucotomos Extract, Baicalin (Scutellaria Root  Extract), Vitamin E, Niacinamide, Phenoxyethanol,Titanium Dioxide, Carbomer 940 & Fragrance\n\nComment:\nUnang tingin pa lang, kita na agad na ang daming mali-mali sa ingredient list na inilagay sa box. Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate ang tamang entry dapat dun sa UV filter na ginamit, hindi Octyl, Methoxycinnamate (pati yung comma sablay ang pwesto). Making entry din ang Vitamin E sa ingredient list, either dapat Tocopherol o kaya Tocopheryl Acetate ang inilagay jan (kung alin man jan sa dalawa ang ginamit), dahil hindi considered na INCI name ang Vitamin E. Meron pang isa, yung Carbomer 940. Carbomer lang dapat ang nakalagay jan, dahil ang Carbomer 940 ay isang grade lamang ng Carbomer at hindi ito tamang INCI name. Isa pa, since tinted itong sunscreen na ito, bakit hindi nakalagay ang mga pigments na ginamit dito (Iron oxide Red / C.I. 77491; Iron oxide Yellow/C.I. 77492; Iron oxide Black/C.I. 77499)? Panghuli, hindi gumagamit ng \"&\" symbol sa ingredient list kapag nasa dulo. \n\nNgayon tingnan naman natin ang ilan sa mga product claims nito namedyom problematic (makikita sa Pic 1 at Pic 3):\n1. SPF 50 PA ++++ UVA/UVB Sun Protection (Pic 1) \n2. Broad spectrum (Pic 1) \n3. Fragrance Free (Pic 3) \n4. Provides broad spectrum SPF 50 coverage using zinc oxide... \n\nAnong mga problema sa mga claims na ito?\n\nUna sa lahat, paano papalo ng SPF 50 ang sunscreen na ito kung ang UV filters lang na ginamit ay Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate at Titanium Dioxide lang? Kahit pa sabihin nating nakasagad sa 10% ang Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate na ginamit, malabo pa din mangyari yan. \n\nIkalawa, papaano na-claim na broad spectrum ang sunscreen na ito at may UVA protection, kung malinaw naman sa ingredient list na walang nakalagay na UVA filter? Ni hindi nga ito naglagay ng Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane (Avobenzone) para masabi man lang na may UVA filter ito.\n\nIkatlo, claim ng product na ito na may zinc oxide ito kaya naging broad spectrum. Paano mangyayari yan e wala naman sa ingredient list ang zinc oxide? \n\nIkaapat, nag-claim ang product na Fragrance free. E ang linaw-linaw sa ingredient list na may Fragrance. At nung ginamit ko yung product, meron ngang fragrance, pero hindi kalakasan, sakto lang para ma-mask yung amoy ng base. So basag na agad yung claim nito na Fragrance free. \n\nNgayon, tumungo naman tayo sa actual product use. Una kong napansin dito ay yung packaging. In fairness, cute naman ang bote, hugis araw. Ok sana tong bote kasi yung gitna nung bote e gawa sa squeezable material. Ang problema ko lang, nababakbak yung white na print, which is ok naman sana, kaso sumasama sya sa kamay kapag pinapahid na sa mukha yung sunscreen, kaya napagkamalan ko pang titanium dioxide na hindi na-disperse ng maayos. In fairness naman din sa product, hindi naman nag-pill sa balay ko nung ginamit ko na. \n\nFinal Verdict:\nKung hindi ko inurirat yung mga nakasulat sa box nitong product na ito, aakalain kong ok or matino ito. E ang kaso, ang daming mali at inconsistencies nitong product nito sa kanyang mga claim, kaya magdududa ka talaga kung maayos e. Di komo FDA notified ang isang product e maayos na. Kaya sa ating lahat na gumagamit ng skincare products, lagi tayong maging mapanuri sa mga binibili nating produkto. ",

I posted a TikTok regarding the “fragrance” part kasi how can they claim to be “fragrance-free” and have “fragrance” on the ingredient list. \n\nI also reached out to the CEO OF HIKARI via DMs and other skincare influencers (who are promoting it) to get their thoughts baka ako lang ang misinformed and I’m assuming incorrectly. I have not received any response pa. \n\nI also sent the company an email via their website and I still have not received any feedback I feel like I’m taking crazy pills (lol) \n\nI also joined one of the livestreams ng CEO nila and asked the question on live but it was just ignored. \n\nThank you for posting this it’s eating me up",

        "body": "Based on my observation, the more a \"cheap\" product is shilled sa socmed and e-commerce platforms, the less I'm enticed bumili. Hindi naman sa pagiging matapobre no, pero looking sa price point ng products ni Hikari Skin Essentials (not just their sunscreen but their rejuv products too) you will really question yung quality ng binebenta nila. Sorry pero it's giving Rosmar and Viyline levels na ang target market is low-income people na naghahanap ng madaliang solution to skin problems at a low price point, regardless of the sussy quality.\n\nIf anyone needs affordable na locally-made beauty products, better stick na lang to mainstream brands na available sa Mercury and Watsons. Sure, malakas mambudol si Watsons as we all know pero surely every single brand they sell (including theirs) dumaan yan sa maayos na R&D at quality control.\n\nAnd if kelangan talaga ng  products na may pangmalakasang support like sunscreen, dun na mag-invest ng magandang brand if your budget can accommodate it.",

Hindi ko inakala na maraming magkukumento dito sa post ko na ito. \n\nSa mga nanghihingi ng recommendation ko sa kung anong sunscreen ang bagay sa kanila, pasensya na hindi ako makakapag recommend. Una sa lahat, hindi ko alam ang kundisyon ng inyong balat, kung kayo ba ay dry, oily, combination, o sensitive skin. Di ko din alam kung ano ang skin tone nyo (kung fair, light, o morena/o). Hindi ko din alam kung may mga existing kayong condition sa balat (e.g. melasma, rosacea, atiouc dermatitis, atbp.). Pangalawa, hindi ko din alam kung anong preference nyo sa isang sunscreen. Kung ang gusto nyo ba e matte o dewy, or kung pang daily use lang ba o pang beach. Ikatlo, hindi ko din alam kung magkano ang budget nyo sa sunscreen. Dahil alam naman natin na mumurahin, mid-range, at premium na sunscreen. \n\nAng tanging masasabi ko lang is kung meron na kayong ginagamit na sunscreen ngayon na inyong na-research ng maigi at kumportable naman kayong gamitin araw-araw ng walang problema, at pasok sa budget nyo, e para sa akin, yan na yung akmang sunscreen para sa inyo.",

The new formulas look promising and many of the brands are being extra careful this time with independent testing, so we can be 100% confident that these sunscreens are the labeled SPF.

I personally would go for the Be Plain when it's available because it has a simplified formula without the unnecessary plant extracts and flower oils. I think the Be Plain one would be better for oily skin than the Round Lab one. Both of the Hyggee sunscreens look promising, but I'm gravitating towards the Vegan Sun Cream because it is a chemical sunscreen and I have a tan complexion, I don't want to risk a white cast. However, the Real Sun Cream does have an interesting ingredient list and whipped texture (as I can see on Yesstyle)  and I will be looking out for reviews to see whether it leaves a white cast or not and make my decision accordingly. What I love about the Hyggee sunscreens is that they are fragrance/essential oil free, but they still contain alcohol. I prefer alcohol because it allows the sunscreen to set better and be less tacky. If you have oily skin, I would think that one of the Hyggee sunscreens would work better for you because I have a Kolmar sunscreen (Isntree Watery Sun Gel) that is similar to the new Round Lab and Be Plain sunscreens and I definitely wouldn't recommend it for oily skin as it is way too shiny.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that the Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream has beet root extract, which made me think of the Krave Beet Shield. Get this, the Beet Shield was also made in Cosmax, same as this new Hyggee one. So I did some digging and found out that the Beet Shield has the SAME exact 5 filters as this new Hyggee sunscreens in the same order. The rest of ingredients are not too similar though, so I do not think they are the same exact sunscreen, as opposed to how I feel about the Be Plain and Round Lab sunscreens, which I do think are almost identical. I do think this Vegan Sun Cream is inspired by the Beet Shield, with maybe an improved formula, since the Beet Shield did not pass SPF tests. So if you are looking for a replacement of the Krave Beauty Beet Shield but with verified SPF protection, get the new Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream!",

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

    "body": "Hiya,\n\nI hope you enjoy the below reviews. I'm just a regular consumer buying everything with my own money - i.e., nothing sponsored, etc. Note, I've bought all of them on sale for around AUD$15-20 because I like sales haha.\n\nProducts:\n\n1. PKY - essence toner;\n2. PKY - mist toner;\n3. Secret Key - fresh nature toner - milk brightening one;\n4. Benton - Aloe BHA Toner;\n5. Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner; and\n6. Purito - Centella Green Level Calming Toner & the unscented version (Purito Unscented Centella Toner)\n\nMy skin used to be severely dry but is now slightly dry on the cheek areas and slightly oily on the t-zone during summer and slightly dry on the whole face in the winter.\n\nAlso note that the below two PKY products have different 'actives'/hero ingredients notwithstanding them seemingly being quite similar! I've bolded the plant extracts under the ingredient headers below.\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Essence Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495), *Australian* websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. *Note, this one is generally recommended for people with drier skin whereas the mist version is generally recommended for those with oilier skin* Friends with eczema have also used this with success. *.* I can use both year round without breaking out. I've had friends with oilier skin who've used this one and have broken out. YMMV.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** LOVE THIS. May repurchase this for the rest of my life. I've used this after breaking my moisture barrier, after chemical peels, after active masks, and also *after getting my face ablatively lasered (after the the initial few days of only using an ointment)*. It's REALLY benign in a godly way. If you want it to do anything other than hydrate or increase the penetration of your other actives, this isn't the product for you (note, it doesn't claim to do anything else apart from hydrate & calm really).\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a little bit thicker than water but not as thick as the Purito centella toners. Won't run off your hand/face like water will but will eventually run off.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** None at allll, even when I broke my moisture barrier.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? Yes**/I have rebought this 4 or so times so far.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Mist Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance. This is in a spray bottle and is better suited to oily skinned persons.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1060395517?cpid=1060395516&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1060395517%3Fcpid%3D1060395516%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=876677637398885328), and Australian websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/pyunkang-mist-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. This one is more for people with slightly oilier skin too. It's a lighter formula than the essence one.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Decent hydration, I prefer to use this in the toner stage instead of after my skincare but I have enjoyed using it as a 'refreshing' spray during the day.\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a nice mist, doesn't run on the face. Feels like a spray of water?\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a spray bit on top. I've had no issues with it but one mate had a couple that didn't spray properly.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** Unsure. I've rebought it once but haven't gone to use this one as much as I have the PKY essence toner or the Purito Unscented Centella Toner. I also don't like mists a whole bunch as they can go onto your clothes (if you're out) or jewellery if you're wearing any. But, I did go through a phase of keeping it in my handbag and using it when out and about for a bit of hydration.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Coptis Japonica Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Secret Key - Fresh nature Toner (Milk Brightening)**\n\n**What is it:** Hydrating toner that's meant to brighten your skin.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx.

Couldn't use it long enough to notice anything.\n\n**Smell:** A very strong scent that I could barely use it. I think I used it around 5-10 times before binning it - I couldn't even put up with the scent of this to use it on other parts of my body.\n\n**Feel:** really watery.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Fortunately (given the high fragrance), no reactions to this. If you had any irritation though, I'd expect some sort of reaction.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? No**, given I threw mine out.\n\n**Ingredients:** Not a comprehensive list given there's a generic list on yesstyle then a list below it for the main ones in the milk one but here -\n\n700ppm) \\[**sic**\\], 1, 2-Hexandiol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata Extract, Nonoxynol-12, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Tremella Fuciformis Extract, Allantoin, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Cucumber Extract, Propylene Glycol, Tomato Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Rice Extract, Lanoline, Tea Tree Leaf Water (9, Sciadopitys Verticillata Root Extract, Pumpkin Extract, Papaya Fruit Extract, Oleth-10, Viola Tricolor Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Ethanol, Glyceryl Stearate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Chamomilia Recutita Flower Extract, Morus Alba Bark Extract, Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Lemon Extract, Oleth-5, Sodium Hyaluronate, Potato Extract, Pomegranate Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Sap Extract, Bean Extract, Aloe Vera Leaf Water (9, Broccoli Extract, Glycerin, Green Tea Extract, Plantago Asiatica Extract, Hollyhock Root Extract, Witch Hazel Extract (9, Phenoxyethanol, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Mineral Oil, Ulmus Campestris Extract, Carrot Extract, Polysorbate 80, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rose Damascena Flower Water (9, Korean Raspberry Extract, Milk Protein Extract (9, White Willow Bark Extract, Psidium Guajava Fruit Extract, Witch Hazel Extract, 4-Terpineol, Algae Extract\n\nand then it says the main ones in the milk version are -\n\ngalactomyces ferment filtrate, pomegranate extract, physalis alkenkengi extract, milk protein concentrate, raspberry extract, pasque flower extract, potato extract, carrot extract, pumpkin extract, rice extract, usnea extract, broccoli extract\n\nso who really knows what's in it...\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Benton Aloe BHA Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating toner which is meant to gently exfoliate with 0.5% salicylic acid.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$23. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/benton-aloe-bha-skin-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1053033537), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** people with sensitive and dry skin as it's quite rich.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** on and off since mid 2020, still using it randomly to just use it up.\n\n**My thoughts:** Per Google (may not be accurate), it has a pH of 5.5 which is too high for there to be any noticeable exfoliation with 0.5% BHA present. I've not noticed any calming effects. It is definitely hydrating but given it's advertised as a BHA toner I'm quite disappointed at the lack of BHA efficacy here. I would much rather use the purito centella toner to hydrate and calm my skin as the centella has other benefits such as helping to stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** Similar to the PKY essence toner. Not as thick as the purito centella toners.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a pump on top. No issues with it, but it can come out a bit forcefully sometimes.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **No**, almost threw it out but am trying to use it up.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nAloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Water (80%), Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Beta-Glucan, Polyglutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea (Green Purslane) Extract, Psidium Guajava (Guava) Fruit Extract, Salicylic Acid (0.5%), Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract (200mg), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice (200mg), Arginine, Pentylene Glycol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Polysorbate 20, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** **Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 relief toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$25 for 180mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/etude-house-soon-jung-ph-5-5-relief-toner-180ml-180ml/info.html/pid.1058586258), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone. It adds light hydration with benign ingredients - akin to the PKY toners but very minimally more expensive. It'd be good if you have irritated and/or dry skin.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** I used it once/twice a day until I used it up. Bought it in December 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Pretty decent. I'd recommend this to the same group of people who'd use the PKY essence toner. Nothing ground breaking. I prefer the calming nature of the Purito Unscented Centella Toner or even the PKY essence toner if you want zero actives (if you consider centella an 'active').\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** A watery toner.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** No but for no fault of the product. I just prefer using the Purito Unscented Centella one as it's just as benign, a bit cheaper, and has the benefits of centella.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, Propanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Madecassoside, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Polyglycerin-3, Disodium EDTA\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**Centella Green Level Calming Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804) **& the** [**Centella Unscented Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380)\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating and calming toner - may also stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$30 but I've always bought it on sale for approx. AUD$20-25 for 200mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380), [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml)\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone however this is best suited to those with any sort of irritation, acne, or redness. That is, if you have basically perfect skin you're probably not going to notice much of a difference but if you have irritation etc then you'll likely fall in love. Also good if you're wanting to help stimulate collagen production especially for the low price point - target ages for this is probably mid twenties and up.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** religiously since April 2020, sometimes twice a day.\n\n**My thoughts:** *BLOODY EXCELLENT*. I'm on my second bottle of this. My first bottle was the first listed one (scented) and then they released the unscented one so I bought that! It's incredible. I love it. In my opinion, it's partially why my skin is able to tolerate me using actives so much. It's excellent to use before actives as it doesn't interact with anything and really good to use after an 'active' mask or a clay mask etc. I switched to the unscented one to just reduce the risk of irritation.\n\n*also studies, which I haven't read but have seen derms I trust on insta etc, say that* ***centella can help stimulate/produce collagen... a big yes from me given it's a calming ingredient that shouldn't purge you or break you out*** *(unless you're allergic/sensitive to it)!*\n\n**Smell:** The scented one smells herbaceous (akin to Asian herbal medicine - I don't mind it but others may). The unscented one doesn't really smell like anything / I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** thick/fat/heavy water. Not a watery toner. Enjoyable.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Neverrrrrr, this helps me reduce the side effects from using actives such as retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, etc.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **Yes** & I have. Will probably rebuy for life.\n\n**Ingredients:** 4 variants as they've got the scented and unscented versions, and then those with and without witch hazel\n\nnon-witch hazel unscented version -\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract (strengthens skin barrier), Butylene Glycol (humectants), Pentylene Glycol (skin-conditioning agents), Dipropylene Glycol (humectants), 1,2-Hexanediol (stabilizers), Trehalose (humectants), Sodium Hyaluronate (natural moisturizing factor/ humectants), Hamemelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiaticoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiatic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Madecassic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Panthenol (strengthens skin barrier), Carbomer (viscosity increasing agents), Allantoin (skin protectants), Arginine (skin-conditioning agents), Portulaca Oleracea Extract (skin-conditioning agents), Ethylhexylglycerin (skin-conditioning agents), Disodium EDTA (stabilizers)\n\nI hope these reviews were useful :)",

A lot of skincare is based on “it *should * work” theoretically, but unless it’s tested with real outside factors (not done only in a lab) like does it penetrate the skin, does it work on skin pH, does it work with other products, and many other factors, I wouldn’t trust claims like increasing collagen production. I would only trust claims I can see after using a product. \n\n\nAs far as I know, topical creams cannot generate collagen production. Collagen is created from the foods you eat. I’m not even sure you can take collagen supplements to increase collagen production because everything in your body is broken down in the same way and your body will direct the amino acids to where the body needs it most and not where you might want it.",

It is unlikely that gold provides any notable benefits.**\n\n**The retail price of $100 is not justified by any ingredients or similar product retail prices.**\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\nThis is going to be long, but with everything going around about this moisturizer, I thought it was important to do some actual research on this product and its claims. There are a few things I want to clear up before I start:\n\n\\- This is not a post to start drama or to say bad things about Boxycharm OR Faccia Skin. This is simply research on the claims of the product and whether or not there is evidence that these claims are true. I intend to make NO speculations about this and only present the facts as I can find them (and cite them). If I do make any speculations, please call me out for it and I will remove them.\n\n\\- I am not going to tell you whether or not to use this product. This is just the information I think you should have to make an educated decision for yourself.\n\n\\- I have no stake in this product and hope that makes me as unbiased as possible. I don’t receive premium, and I don’t intend to buy. None of what I say here is based on my experience with the product OR any reviews of the product. \n\nFinally, the intention of this is to investigate these claims based on being an “average consumer.” I know that the actual average consumer does not actually do this much research. What I mean by this is that all this information comes from available online databases and resources, and the first couple pages of Google. I’m not doing a deep dive into any Instagram pages or people’s private lives to find this information. I intend for all of it to be easily verifiable by anyone who wants to find it.\n\nI will investigate 4 things about this product: cruelty free claims, safety of ingredients, benefit claims, and retail value.\n\n**Cruelty Free Claims:**\n\nAccording to [Cruelty Free Kitty](https://www.crueltyfreekitty.com/cruelty-free-101/cruelty-free-bunny-logo/) there are no laws to regulate when a company claims to be cruelty free. However, there are three organizations that have standards to verify a company’s cruelty-free status, and then allow them to use their logo to indicate to consumers that the product has met that set of standards. \n\nFaccia skin uses the PETA “Beauty without Bunnies” logo on their packaging, which means they claim to meet PETA’s standards as a cruelty-free company/product. Also according to Cruelty Free Kitty, if a company uses the logo but does not appear on PETA’s list of approved companies, you CANNOT verify that the product is cruelty-free.\n\nFaccia Skin DOES NOT appear on PETA’s list of approved companies, despite using the logo. According to PETA, in order to use the logo, a company must first be verified as Cruelty-Free by PETA, and THEN is able to pay a one-time $100 licensing fee to use the logos on their products ([PETA](https://www.peta.org/about-peta/learn-about-peta/info-businesses/beauty-without-bunnies-program/)). That means that if Faccia Skin is using the logo, they should already be on the list despite being a new company. The FAQ also suggests that this list is updated frequently so consumers are always up to date with additions, deletions, and other changes. [PETA FAQ can be found here.](https://features.peta.org/cruelty-free-company-search/index.aspx)\n\n**TL;DR – Faccia Skin’s cruelty-free status cannot be verified.**\n\nNote here: Other research on this sub has suggested that this company is owned by the same owner as DLS cosmetics, which is both PETA and Leaping Bunny certified. They may be licensing the logo legally, but from what I can tell, does not verify the cruelty-free status of this brand specifically. \n\n**Safety of Ingredients:**\n\nThis is the list of ingredients for this moisturizer on Faccia’s website:\n\nWATER, GLYCERIN, GOLD, HYDROLYZED SERICIN, CARBOMER, BETAINE, TAURINE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, TRIETHANOLAMINE, NIACINAMIDE, BUTANEDIOL, POLYSORBITULE-20, PALMITOYL OLIGOPEPTIDE, PALMITOYL TETRAPEPTIDE-7, ACETYL TETRAPEPTIDE-5, ACETYL HEXAPEPTIDE-8, EDTA-2NA, HYDROLYZED PEARL, FUCUS VESICULOSUS EXTRACT, SODIUM POLYACRYLATE, PEG-40, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, METHYLPARABEN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, DIAZOLIDINYL UREA, IODOPROPYNYL BUTYLCARBAMATE, PARFUM, CI19140\n\nVia SkinCarisma, 8 products on this list have an EWG Health Rating of “Moderate” or “High” risk.\n\nModerate risk:\n\nGold – SkinCarisma identifies this as a “cosmetic colorant” with no benefits\n\nTriethanolamine – This has a comodogenic rating of (2). Incidecoder says that this ingredient is generally safe, but can form carcinogens if it is included in a product with nitra-/nitro- type ingredients. I don’t see any of those ingredients in this list.\n\nMethylparaben – This is a paraben (obviously). There is nothing directly unsafe about using this ingredient. There was a 2006 study that found that skin cells treated with MP had more harmful exposure to sunlight than non-MP treated skin cells. This study was done in a lab and not on actual human skin, so there’s no direct link to this being harmful. When in doubt, wear sunscreen\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea – A preservative, This ingredient is controversial because it belongs to a family of ingredients that may break down into formaldehyde when added to a formula. A 1990 study found that it is safe in concentrations of <0.5%. The evidence on this is unclear, and since we don’t know what the concentration of this ingredient is, I can’t say definitively if it is safe or not. Use your best judgement.\n\nIodopropynyl Butylcarbamate – Also a preservative. This is safe in concentrations of less than 0.1%, and has an extremely low rate of skin irritation. Since we don’t know what the concentration of this ingredient is, I can’t say definitively if it is safe or not. Use your best judgement.\n\nHigh Risk:\n\nButane – Incidecoder brings this up as Butanediol, which is a solvent to help products absorb faster. Its safety has not yet been questioned. It’s sometimes used as a food additive. HOWEVER the ingredients list does actually say Butane and not Butanediol which is used as a propellant. It’s still safe but it doesn’t make sense for an ingredient that is not aerosolized.\n\nFragrance – The problem with this ingredient is that “fragrance” is a general term that can be made up of an average of 30-50 chemicals that aren’t required to be disclosed. A lot of products use this term and are still safe, but because all the ingredients are not disclosed, we can’t say for sure. Use your best judgement.\n\nOther:\n\nPolysorbate 20 – listed as a fungal acne trigger, but is an emulsifier and is safe.\n\nYou can find all this information at incidecoder.com and skincarisma.com\n\n**TL;DR : Basic judgement says that this product is safe to use, unless you are sensitive to fragrances or other ingredients on this list, react to comedogenic products, or have fungal acne.**\n\n**Benefit Claims:**\n\nOn Faccia Skin’s website, they make the following claims about this product:\n\nHydrate skin – We can expect this result based on moisturizing ingredients (glycerin, betaine, sodium hyaluronate, niacinamide, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, PEG-40, Propylene Glycol)\n\nAnti-aging – SkinCarisma lists Niacinamide as the only anti-aging ingredient.\n\nStrengthen skin – SkinCarisma lists Sodium Hyaluronate as an ingredient to promote would healing. Incidecoder also suggests that there are peptides in the ingredients which act as “cell-communicating” agents. Peptides are fairly common in other products that claim strengthening benefits.\n\nEnhance skin “radiance” – We can expect this based on the ingredient Niacinamide as well as moisturizing ingredients. Skincarisma lists Niacinamide as a “brightening” ingredient.\n\nReduce damaging environmental factors – This may be aided by Sodium Hyaluronate as a “wound-healing” ingredient.\n\nIt’s important to note that neither of these ingredient databases list gold as an ingredient with any skin benefits. Here’s some research on the benefits (or not) of gold for the skin from what I believe to be trustworthy sources:\n\n[https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/sensitizing/gold.html](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/sensitizing/gold.html)\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/fashion/27skinWEB.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/fashion/27skinWEB.html)\n\n**TL;DR – We can expect for this product to perform as it claims based on its ingredients. It is unlikely that gold provides any notable benefits.**\n\n**Retail Price:**\n\nI did a quick search of “best 24k gold moisturizers” to compare retail prices for other notable products. It’s hard for me to definitively test the “retail price” claim unless there was a very similar product out there that I can find. So I’ll have to base this on comparisons as well as knowledge of the ingredients themselves. I don’t know the exact volume of the cream in mL so we are going to assume for now that 50g = 1.6 fl oz someone can get me the actual volume I will change this. So $100 for 1.6 oz is $62.5/oz\n\n[Orogold](https://www.orogoldcosmetics.com/shop/orogold-cosmetics/white-gold/24k-deep-moisturizer/) 24K deep moisturizer: $55/oz \n\n[Physicians Formula](https://www.physiciansformula.com/physicians-formula-24-karat-gold-collagen-moisturizer.html) 24k Gold Collagen Moisturizer: $12.5/oz \n\n[Chantecaille](https://www.neimanmarcus.com/p/chantecaille-nano-gold-energizing-cream-1-7-oz-prod50660039?childItemId=NMC0BE1_) Nano Gold Energizing Face cream: $247/oz \n\n[Farsali](https://www.sephora.com/product/rose-gold-elixir-P417139) Rose Gold Elixer (24k infused) - $54/oz \n\n[Peter Thomas Roth](https://www.sephora.com/product/24k-gold-mask-pure-luxury-lift-firm-mask-P392607) 24k Gold Mask - $17/oz \n\n[Nuface](https://www.ulta.com/gel-primer-24k-gold-complex-brighten?productId=xlsImpprod13521083) Gel Primer 24k Gold Complex - $19.5/oz \n\n[Ahava](https://www.ulta.com/24k-gold-mineral-mud-mask?productId=pimprod2004002) 24K Gold Mineral Mud Mask - $34/oz \n\nThe Faccia cream has a price/oz most similar to the Orogold and the Farsali products, and is much cheaper than the Chantecaille cream which is a luxury brand sold at Neiman Marcus. Comparing the Chantecaille incredients list to the Faccia cream, they are very different. The luxury cream has a huge list of various plant oils, extracts and perfumes. That doesn’t make it better, but it does have more ingredients. The Faccia base of water and Glycerin is similar to other water based moisturizers like Neutrogena Hydroboost, Simple, and even Tatcha Water Cream (although all 3 of those contain dimethicone and variants). Tatcha contains some more ingredients like plant extracts. It’s difficult to compare the ingredients lists of the Farsali and Orogold because the textures of the products are so different. However, the Farsali oil ONLY contains 24k gold, vitamin E, and plant oils as the ingredients, and is still cheaper than the Faccia moisturizer. Additionally, the Orogold lists Gold as one of the last few ingredients.\n\nThere doesn’t appear to be anything in the ingredients list other than gold that would justify such a high retail price. Even other notable brands sold at Ulta and Sephora with gold in them do not reach that retail price, which suggests that the gold alone would not be enough to justify such a high retail price. In fact, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate and Methylparaben are all described as “cheap” ingredients on Incidecoder. One of the other star ingredients, niacinamide, is in a lot of products, and I can’t find anything that would indicate it is expensive. You can buy a niacinamide 10% suspension from The Ordinary for less than $6/oz.\n\n**TL;DR: The retail price of $100 is not justified by any ingredients or similar product retail prices.**\n\nMy conclusion: There is nothing wrong with this product at face value since It is safe for most people to use. If cruelty-free products are important to you, I would not use this product until the company’s cruelty free status is verified. As far as retail value goes, there isn’t any reason for you to repurchase at the retail price, unless you love this stuff and you can afford it. For other people, a basic silicone-free gel moisturizer with niacinamide should give you similar results for a lower price point. You can make your own decision about whether you should use it, but now you are educated on what it is, and you hopefully have a better idea of what you’re putting on your body.",

There’s a $15 flask of cinnamon liqueur with gold leaf in it, and it’s inexpensive to add gold leaf to food, etc.  Thanks for the research on the other aspects of cruelty free and parabens!   I have used expensive face creams like Elizabeth Arden Prevage line and see benefits for the cost for that particular brand.  However, I agree that a good moisturizer doesn’t have to cost very much.  Follow the process of cleansing, toning, serum, exfoliating, moisturizer...the massaging of the skin in itself will show benefits!  I can’t afford Prevage since a career change, and I am happier using trial size luxury products now.  The luxury is a gimmick too for the most part!  We pay for the packaging, marketing and fragrance lol!",

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

I sure hope people are buying it so it doesn't get discontinued. I got it for maybe 6000 KRW for the 50 ml tube and it's such a nice moisturizing vehicle with Tinosorb S and Uvinul A Plus. So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

Acne prone. Daily Tretinoin use. \n \nREVIEW:\nI got this a few days ago and am very pleased with it so far. It replaced my Pyunkang yul ato cream blue label in the tube. The packaging is very sleek hard plastic and the wording is imprinted on the outside-they say this is to make it easier to recycle and save from extra plastic labeling. I have also used the gel cream and this is really night and day and not comparable at all imo. It comes in a pump bottle and pumps about a pea size each. I use 2 pumps for my whole face and neck. I struggle with very dry skin that is dry in the morning if I don’t use a very thick moisturizer at night. This keeps my face dewy and moist all night. It’s not thick like a shea butter cream and it spreads very easily. It smells exactly like oats like if you get a handful of ground oats and smell it, that’s what this smells like. It leaves a nice glow but not a greasy finish. My hair doesn’t stick to my face when I use this if that makes sense. It’s a great price point the bottle is bigger than it looks the photos. \n\nThis is my first time doing a review so let me know if I missed something and I’m also happy to answer any questions!",

    "body": "Edit: title should be fatty alcohols not fatty acids but autocorrect thinks for me and sees me type acids a lot so naturally I must’ve meant acids. SIGH. \n\n**WARNING: LONG BUT I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE IT WORTH.**\n\nHey all!\n\nSoooo, years ago, I was a big advocate for the [idea that some people cannot use fatty alcohols](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1y3ql7/simple_tip_for_those_of_us_who_cant_use_fatty/). This was due to my experiences with CeraVe Cream, CeraVe Lotion, Cetaphil Cream, and Cetaphil Lotion, primarily. More, I was using Ziana (.025% tretinoin + clindamycin), which I have a strong suspicion in retrospect was the cause of a form of folliculitis for me (perhaps chemical folliculitis -- there are several types of folliculitis but in this case, acne that is not \"acne,\" but rather born of continuous irritation of the hair follicles). Of course, like *everyone* going through acne, I blamed every skin product I was using except the prescription active that was *designed* to make my acne better. After all, a doctor gave it to me, and a doctor wouldn't give me something that would make me \"sicker.\" \n\nUnfortunately, it turns out that by the time I started to figure this out, it was all way too late. To this day, I have light pitted scarring in places from an 8 month moderate-to-severe zit explosion on my face that never ceased. It has taught me a lot and pressed me to learn a lot about how skin *actually* functions. I was told the entire time I was breaking out that it was just \"purging,\" only to realize what a misnomer \"purging\" kind of is -- implying the skin is holding onto infections waiting to churn out of it's layers rather than comedones -- open or closed -- that are visible, as well as microcomedones that are the beginning of an acne spot but invisible to the naked eye. At the time, purging to me implied that there were acne spots in the deeper layers of my skin waiting to come out. \n\nSo in the process of me flailing, I felt like this class of ingredients that are otherwise harmless were my bane: fatty alcohols. These are stearyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, and cetyl alcohol. After all, they turned up in *everything* that was breaking me out, including the cleansers, so surely it had to be them, right? \n\nFor example, at one point, I was using Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser + CeraVe Cream. What do these products have in common?\n\n**Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser**\n&amp;gt; Water, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, **Stearyl Alcohol**, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben.\n\n**CeraVe Cream**\n&amp;gt;Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20 And **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauryl Lactylate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n\n---\n\nSo being the ingredient hound I am, I connected the dots to \"must be fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives.\" After all, everything else I used had had these ingredients too.\n\n**CeraVe Lotion**\n&amp;gt; Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceteareth-20 and** Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\n**Cetaphil Cream**\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Petrolatum, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, PEG-30 Stearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Propylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n**Cetaphil Lotion** *note - I believe this used to have macadamia nut oil in it when I used it and has since been reformulated. \n\n&amp;gt; Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ceteareth-20, **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Dimethicone, Sodium Levulinate, Sodium Anisate,Caprylyl Glycol, Benzyl Alcohol, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer\n\nHappy, I thought, \"This must be it! I solved it!\" So I cut out fatty alcohol products (which, as I am sure many of you know, is a *massive* pain in the ass) and [tried to facilitate others in doing the same](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ufvym/megalisting_products_without_cetylcetearylstearyl/). In fact, I feel like I was the primary champion of \"it might be fatty alcohols!\" back when this sub was only 25k people, and being as we were all learning from eachother and trusted eachother, many people trusted me in that assumption. After all, I had the proof (supposedly) to back it up.\n\nSo I used the lightest products, such as EltaMD PM (which is a wonderful product, don't get me wrong!). Unfortunately, my skin was parched *all of the time.* It was just sick. It kept breaking out for years after, bottle after bottle of EltaMD PM. Life happened, I was removed from the mod group for inactivity, and I just kept on with it - disappearing from this sub for a long-ass time.\n\nAnd then I started thinking... *what did I use before my skin started down this road?*\n\nBefore I knew jack-all about skin, I used Olay pretty religiously. Olay Regenerist, in the pot, with the fragrance. Yep. This stuff:\n\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Isohexadecane, Niacinamide, Isopropyl Isostearate, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Nylon-12, Dimethicone, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Sodium Peg-7 Olive Oil Carboxylate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ceratonia Siliqua (Carob) Fruit Extract, ** Stearyl Alcohol**, Polyethylene, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Dimethiconol, Polyacrylamide, Fragrance, Peg-100 Stearate, Propylparaben, Cetearyl Glucoside, **Cetearyl Alcohol,** C13-14 Isoparaffin, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, C12-13 Pareth-3, Laureth-7, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica.\n\n*\"[Wait a fucking minute](https://media.giphy.com/media/iAYupOdWXQy5a4nVGk/giphy.gif),\"* she thought. \"That shit has cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol and coconut derivatives all the shit I am avoiding. How the fuck did my face not explode then?\"\n\nSo I did something insane: I tried a cream with fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives that was being recommended on this sub at the time (lol). Some of you may recognize this:\n\n**Cheryl Lee MD Ceramide+**\n&amp;gt;Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Coconut), Petrolatum, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Polyglyceryl -10 Pentastearate, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Isostearyl Isostearate, Cetyl Alcohol, 1,3 Propanediol (from Corn), C10-30 Cholesterol/Lanosterol Esters, Ceramide 3, Phytosphingosine, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Niacinamide, Glycyrrhetinic Acid (Licorice Root), 1,2 -Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Gluconolactone.\n\nAnd you want to know something?\n\n90% of my acne healed in a week. 90% of the acne that had been causing me scars and *ruining my fucking life for years* healed in a fucking **week**. I looked back at all the ingredients for all the products that I had avoided and all the ones I had just been able to use fine as a teenager and by fucking god, what did I miss? **Ceteareth-fucking-20** (sans the cleansers -- I still don't know why my skin hated Cetaphil Gentle, but it turns out that it has broken out with every creamy, non-sudsy cleanser ever, so I've resigned myself to using gentle SLES cleansers for life).\n\nI felt like such a massive asshole. \n\nSo that brings me to now, when I decided on a train on a vacation in NYC to start a skin blog. I had spent those years researching my ass off about skin not to even see what a massive fuckup I had made. I had been able to help my BF bring his eczema 80% into control with bleach bath washes and solve my mom's chronically dry skin and my friend's weird case of eczema on his ring finger, but not my own skin. \n\nI came back to this sub after ~5 fucking years (4 of them AFK) and I still see a lot of people avoiding *all fatty alcohols*. I'm making this post to tell you that it might not be all fatty alcohols. It may be cet-20, like me, or it may be those fatty alcohols in combination with other ingredients (combinations of some ingredients can change molecular sizes, some manufacturers use different sources or molecular sized products, like larger or smaller hyaluronic acid, for example). There's so much complexity with skincare, skin, and ingredients that it usually isn't *one whole class of ingredients*. In short: **your mileage may vary**. This is why spot testing is important, one product isn't for everyone, and while ingredient labels are important for weeding out culprits, you also need to do a bit of research on how ingredients work with others to change how they interact on the skin. \n\nSince then, I've spot tested many of the products I flat-out ruled out and 1. it turns out everything with cet-20 does explode my face, 2. it turns out macadamia nut oil also explodes my face (in the cet lotion), and 3. turns out I can use 50% of the things I thought I couldn't (like jojoba oil!).\n\nI'm so happy that many of you have found this sub educational, but **please** consider what you've used in the past (skincare for face, makeup, EVERYTHING) and don't neglect those products when cross-identifying culprits. It changed my life and it might change yours.\n\nSome takeaways, with bullet points because I love bullet points:\n\n* Don't rule out entire classes of ingredients. Skin is super individual and it may be one stupid ingredient.\n* Don't take all of your skincare advice from the Internet, and if you do, try to diversify. Reddit, acne.org, MakeupAlley, medical journals -- get in there and become your own advocate.\n* Sometimes, skin is just an asshole and you won't be able to figure out what it hates. Example: My skin has issues with CeraVe healing ointment and foaming wash, despite them lacking cet-20. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n* Sometimes, what is considered \"good\" or \"best\" for skin isn't good or best for your skin. Example for me: creamy cleansers. They're definitely recommended *everywhere* for *every* skin condition, esp rosacea (which I have), but my skin fucking loathes them all. No idea why, and that's okay.\n* Just because an ingredient is \"good\" for skin doesn't mean it is good for your skin. Example: Me and high % niacinamide = zits. Me and low % niacinamide = k.\n* Just because it's a prescription doesn't mean it can't fuck you up, fam. I thought prescription = good, no problems here, won't cause issues. I have literal scars to prove me wrong. Instead of assuming all is well, **TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR IF SHIT IS UP AND IF YOUR DOCTOR IS LIKE HEY SHIT IS FINE BUT YOU STILL THINK SHIT IS FUCKED, GO TO ANOTHER DOCTOR**. I wish I had done this. Instead, my doc kept urging me to use it every single night. Went to a new doc and he was like, \"Oh no, your skin is very sensitive, that is wayyyy too harsh.\" Listen to your gut.\n* Almost alll skin rules are more like guidelines (except the baking soda, lemon juice, harsh harsh scrubs stuff - that's all still true since they can all throw your skin very out of whack). Example: I do better with light physical exfoliation once a week than AHA any day.\n\nThanks, and I'm sorry for being such a massive, incorrect asshole. I'm doing my best to correct my errors now (and hopefully go to esthetics school though BF is pushing me to do dermatology).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",

There needs to be someone on the medical side who can vouch for us not being complete loons about our skin. \n\nYes I have to agree with the sentiment of your post.... over the last few years my skin has been freaking out over every little thing. Too hot, too cold, aha, bha, B3, HA, phenoxyethanol the list goes on. \n\nFor 7months I used Tretinoin 0.025% and built up slowly (I thought), the purge happened. Traumatic. Then just unhappy skin.... but it is gold standard for my issues right? My face said no. \n\nAfter becoming ill last year, severely for 6+ months, all skincare and Tret use went down the drain. Just SS once a day, used as moisturiser. Rarely even washed my face in the evening I was too exhausted. \n\nWhat this did, apart from giving me Cc's and what have you. Was a chance for my skin to repair my moisture barrier on my face. Since medication has helped with the symptoms of my illness,  I have been able to use 1 product in my routine with phenoxyethanol as the main preservative, without it giving me painful pustles and nodules everywhere I experienced before. \n\nI have realised that the rash of whiteheads where ever I use a product with HA in and determined was the HA also happens with high levels of BG. So now planning to test a large molecular weight HA serum to see if I have the same issue without the BG. PG is fine... Propanidol is great. \n\nB3 🤔 causes flushing in my skin. And I'm not really interested in trying again.... \n\nBHA, again let me try again at some point. But method of application might be the issue here. \n\nSo vitamin c seemed out of the lexicon for my skin. I now have a silicone based C vit lined up to trial. \n\nFragerance/ essential oils can still mess me up doh. \n\nMoral of this story for me? Concentrate on keeping healthy skin barrier. The rest comes after.... so cleanse (favourite step), treat (calming, hydrating, emollient and then the acne/PIH target), protect. This approach has been working for me so far.",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea?

        "body": "My Mom had subtype 3, with thickened skin. She had it really badly her whole life. I have some rosacea but have done my best to try to not wind up like her.  Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

This took me a few days to start writing and ruminate on, so I’m really glad it seemed worth it for a lot of people. I’ll try to keep this going in for future major Ipsy skincare items! I’m about to get really busy in a month but I’ll do what I can! ❤️\n\nHey all,\n\nI've been seeing a lot of  posts about the Cryo ATP Sports Booster serum and how people don't know what it is exactly supposed to do... it doesn't help that the official 111Skin's description for it is just filled with nonsensical marketing bullsh\\*t. Considering the huge price tag, I think we're all feeling a lot more curious about it than most serums that wind up in our bags. As I'm reluctantly receiving this in my bag (Ipsy chose it for me), I'm putting in some time to figure it out.\n\n**Objective & Disclaimer:** Let's put aside the pseudoscience jargon used in 111Skin's description and try to figure out what the serum itself should do for your skin. I'm not an expert *in any way* but I'm a skincare enthusiast... I thought maybe it might be worth posting an interpretation of what this serum is formulated to do, since it appears the company itself fails to say anything useful at all on their website. At the very end of this, I'll explain how I think this product got its name. Again, I'm not an expert so if anyone knows better or has their own input feel free to chime in!\n\n**Product description per** [**official webpage**](https://111skin.com/products/cryo-atp-sports-booster): \"Mimicking the effect of extreme cold on the skin, this booster contains natural cellular energy, ATP, to encourage more oxygen for optimised cell function. Just a few drops of this highly-charged formula will reignite lacklustre skin, leaving it tightened, toned, and refined for a reinvigorated complexion. Perfect for use post-workout, this booster will prolong freshness for enlivened and refreshed skin.\"\n\n**Ingredients list**:  Aqua / Water / Eau, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Vp/Polycarbamyl Polyglycol Ester, Ribose, Acrylates Copolymer, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Carbomer, Hydrolysed Sesame Protein Pg-Propyl Methylsilanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Tromethamine, Adenosine, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Adenosine Triphosphate, Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow / Achillée) Extract, Xanthan Gum, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Fragrance / Parfum.\n\nOK, now let's break it down \\[key ingredients in **bold**\\].\n\n* **#1 Water**\n* **#2 Glycerin--** this is a humectant, meaning it attracts water into the skin and helps with hydration. The fact that this is #2 tells you that this should be a moisturizing serum.\n* **#3 Niacinamide--** I'm pleased to see that this is #3 in the ingredients list-- and I believe this should make the biggest difference in the serum for most people that aren't already using niacinamide. It's essentially a niacinamide serum with a lot of other bells and whistles. Niacinamide  (aka vitamin B3) is a really common ingredient that is non-irritating to most people but can cause some stinging sensation for some. It evens out skintone, reduces appearance of pores, evens out skin texture (ie, reduces congestion), and boosts ability for moisturizers to work (and thus is wonderfully paired with glycerin).  Most people that aren't already using a serum or some kind of special moisturizer might not have niacinamide in their routine, which is why I think this'd be the most \"groundbreaking\" ingredient for those that aren't already using it. It's the key ingredient that is the reason people rave about the Peach and Lily's Glass Serum which is essentially a niacinamide and hyaluronic acid serum. But here's the catch-- all these benefits won't happen overnight. It needs to be used consistently over a period of at least a week, but likely much longer than that, to start showing effects. Here's a great [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qd7J1UNGUo&t=909s) by Dr. Dray, a real dermatologist, that explains benefits of niacinamide.\n* \\#4 Butylene glycol-- a solvent so ingredients that don't dissolve well in water can be more evenly spread out in the serum\n* \\#5 1,2-Hexanediol-- a preservative\n* \\#6 Betaine-- a humectant\n* \\#7 Polyglycerol-10 Laurate-- skin softener\n* \\#8 Phenoxyethanol-- a preservative\n* \\#9 Caprylyl Glycol-- a humectant\n* \\#10 Vp/Polycarbamyl Polyglycol Ester-- I actually don't know what this is and can't find an immediate Google answer\n* **#11 Ribose-**\\- a component of ATP, which helps explain the product's name. It apparently [might play a role](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3047922/) in helping boost collagen production. \\[[Another source](https://www.oskiaskincare.com/skin-nutrition/patented-actives/ribose/#:~:text=Riboxyl%20or%20Ribose%20is%20a,naturally%20in%20all%20living%20cells.&text=It%20is%20the%20only%20known,new%20energy%20to%20tired%20skin) that explains the mechanism a little bit.\\]\n* \\#12 Acrylates Copolymer-- a microplastic for enhancing texture of product\n* \\#13 Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer-- thicken product, enhances texture of product\n* \\#14 Carbomer-- thicken product\n* \\#15 Hydrolysed Sesame Protein Pg-Propyl Methylsilanediol-- skin tightener\n* \\#16 Pentylene Glycol-- a humectant\n* \\#17 Tromethamine-- a pH adjuster\n* **#18 Adenosine**\\-- a component of ATP, which helps explain the product's name. It [might play a role](https://koreanskincaretips.com/adenosine-in-skincare/)in helping boost collagen production (and thus can may have anti-wrinkle properties).\n* **#19 Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil**\\-- offers a cooling sensation upon application, and I suspect is the reason 111Skin relates this product to cryotherapy... even though it has nothing to do with it. It might feel nice on the skin at first for people that aren't immediately irritated, but it can be an irritating ingredient to those with sensitive skin. This might be why some people are saying that they're seeing some redness after application. In the long term it's a sensitizing ingredient. Don't continue its use if you find your skin is irritated upon application. Edit: I should’ve researched this more, but it seems eucalyptus oil also has antiseptic, anti inflammatory, and antioxidant properties, which are all good things. However, it’s also not recommended by a lot of dermatologists due to how easily it can irritate skin for some people. (This is the case for many essential oils.)\n* \\#20 Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer\n* **#21 Adenosine triphosphate**\\-- ATP itself and gives the serum its name. This [L'oreal webpage](https://www.lorealparisusa.com/ingredient-library/atp.aspx) succinctly describes what its supposed to do in skincare.\n* \\#22 Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow / Achillée) Extract-- skin soothing properties\n* \\#23 Xanthan gum-- for product texture\n* \\#24 Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil-- an emollient\n* \\#25 Fragrance/parfum-- the yummy smells and potential irritant\n\n**Interpretation**: There's a fair amount of humectants in this serum, with glycerin being #2 right after water. That can be promising for people with dry skin. Right after glycerin is niacinamide, which if you don't know is a holy grail ingredient for a lot of products. Anyone that doesn't already have this in their routine but has textured skin, irritation, uneven skintone, or enlarged pores, may benefit the most from this serum. Note that the positive effects of niacinamide will take weeks to show, so don't expect this to work overnight! Unfortunately niacinamide can cause some stinging sensation for some people which can be off putting. The \"*cryo*\" part in the product name is thanks to the eucalyptus oil, which gives a cooling effect on the skin upon application. Really, it doesn't serve any substantial service. Maybe some people will find it temporarily soothing but those with sensitive skin, it is a major irritant and a sensitizer. Lastly, the \"*ATP*\" portion of the name-- there's ribose, adenosine, and adenosine triphosphate in the serum. These ingredients are supposed to interact together to promote rejuventation, whatever the hell that means. From the webpages I've linked, it seems these three ingredients should promote collagen production within the skin, which should help battle wrinkling and dullness of the skin.  I haven't delved too deep into the studies that show its efficacy but if someone else wants to do that, please share with us what you find! As for why this product has \"*sports*\" in the name? ...Uh, because the eucalyptus oil might feel good on hot skin post-workout, and something about adding ATP onto one's skin will supposedly help restore ATP that is supposedly used up during the workout?\n\nAnyway, overall I'm optimistic about this serum for people with non-sensitive skin. The eucalyptus oil and fragrance/parfum added might be too much for some of us to handle, but for those that can handle it and that don't have a robust skincare routine yet, I'm optimistic that the niacinamide can make a difference for a lot of people. Do I think it's worth the price tag because of that though? Nope. There's a lot of affordable niacinamide serums out there-- off the top of my head, The Ordinary's niacinamide + zinc serum \\[<$10\\] and Peach and Lily's glass skin serum \\[<$40\\] are the holy grails for so many people. (The glass skin serum is my own HG for fixing my textured skin.) As for the ATP components of this serum... without looking more into efficacy studies I'm not sure if it'll do anything on that front. If anything, the niacinamide should visibly address the things that the ATP ingredients should supposedly  be taking care of. As long as it isn't harmful, then, ah well why not, I guess.\n\nThat said, I just wanted to remind anyone new to skincare that it takes weeks to show major results... but if you are having a bad reaction to it, stop using it! Irritation on the skin can spur so many issues, it isn't worth it.\n\ntl;dr-- I think this is just a fancy niacinamide serum and 111Skin tried to set themselves apart from other products by adding words like \"cryo\" and \"ATP\"... and tried to make it niche by adding \"sports\". Aside from marketing BS, it might not be a horrible serum and would be worth trying for anyone that doesn't have a niacinamide product yet (assuming niacinamide, eucalyptus oil, and/or  fragrance doesn't irritate their skin too much).",

    "body": "Companies sometimes share the percentage retinol they use, but it's good to realize this is sometimes not the percentage of the pure retinol, but of a mixture.\n\nPhrases like \"1% coated retinol\" , \"a 1% retinol complex serum\" or we use \"0.5% slow release retinol\" are indicications they could be referring to a mixture/complex. Percentages like 2.5% or 3% are very unlikely pure retinol. There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M. Asam Retinol 1% Intense:**\n\n* Claim: 1% retinol in encapsulated form\n* Indications it's not 1%: Retinyl Palmitate is usually used below 0.3%. Polyurethane Crosspolymer-1 and Glycine Soja Oil are part of RetiCap PF, most likely this serum contains 0.08% Retinol.\n* Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, **Retinyl Palmitate, Retinol,** Panthenol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Tocopherol, Lauroyl Lysine, Dipentaerythrityl Pentaisononanoate, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl- 10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, **Polyurethane Crosspolymer- 1,** Caprylyl Glycol, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Second example, Inkey List Retinol Serum:**\n\n* Claim: 1% stable retinol and 0.5% granactive retinoid\n* Indications it's not 1%: Tocopherol, Carbomer in general are not used above 1%. Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula. So 1.5% total retinoid, no not really, more likely it's 0.1% max.\n* Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Caprylyl Glycol,** Phospholipids, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Squalane, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Extract, **Carbomer**, Sodium Ascorbate, **Tocopherol,** Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolipids, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol,** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Third example,**[Dr Brandt 2% Retinol serum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26OFz0DakQc&t=0m13s)**:**\n\n* claim 2% Retinol Complex\n* Why it's not 2%: Tocopherol and Phenoxyethanol are not used above 1%. Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens® B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70.

Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens® B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well. Otherwise some options below. \n\n* UK: Dermatica - \"otc\" tretinoin\n\n* US: Curology - \"otc\" tretinoin or Adapalene\n\n* [Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice.com/clinical-1pct-retinol-treatment/801.html) - $58/30mL\n\n* [Avene RetrinAl 0.1% Retinaldehyde](https://www.aveneusa.com/retrinal-intensive-cream) - $70/30mL\n\n* [Geek&Gorgeous 0.05% Retinaldehyde](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/a-game-5) $13.50/30mL",

        "body": "So I was looking into [Physiogel Calming Relief AI cream](https://incidecoder.com/products/physiogel-calming-relief-ai-cream) in more depth, and I'm so confused about the ingredient Palmitamide MEA aka PEA aka Palmitoylethanolamide. Because with a brief look earlier I saw the Palmitamide MEA in it and thought it's one of the ceramides (the names are so similar haha!). However, today I saw incidecoder mentioning it as just a viscosity controlling ingredient (and I usually find them quite accurate), but more things came up where I saw something from mdedge [here](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/74188_main.pdf) stating \"Palmitamide MEA (PEA) is an important component of MimyX nonsteroidal cream, Dr. Smith said. PEA is an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties\" but this doctor has a consulting agreement with Stiefel Labs, which manufactures Physiogel. Also came across this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/) but it's testing a synthetic ceramide PC-104 in combination with other things like Palmitamide MEA, grapeseed extract etc. Plus, I remember reading an AMA from kindofstephen where he said \" I think most cosmetic companies would attribute patents as a marketing cost. Most novel patents I've seen in the cosmetic industry are to deal with delivery vehicles (like an airless soft container, etc)\". My takeaway is things can be patented even if they're not doing too much, because to consumers it seems like it's doing a lot? And now idk if this ingredient/Physiogel is any good as a ceramide cream or it's just a good plain heavy moisturiser.\n\nEdit: Realised this ingredient is present in Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume, along with SK-Influx, where it's described as \"Atoderm Intensive Baume quickly stops itching and reduces the urge to scratch thanks to its anti-itching dermatological active ingredient PEA\"\n\nMy understanding is Physiogel doesn't have any ceramides or cholesterol/phytosterols (looks like Zeroid uses phytosterols in place of cholesterol?), but has PEA as a fatty acid (skin similar ingredient), so it must be a good moisturiser but not an ideal-ratio ceramide moisturiser.",

    "body": "For the purposes of this review of multiple products, I’ll be *categorizing items by routine placement* rather than when it was introduced.  These items are very much YMMV but I thought it may be helpful for some who are newer to AB (seen with the large influx of newbie questions I’ve seen in the DHT) or even those wondering about products generally.  Also **this isn’t a particular look at my routine(s)** or how my routine has transformed as I’ve learned more about my skin; rather, this review is of products used to target particular concerns.  This mega-review really came about after a response comment from /u/theCuriousAmerican (whom I thank for keeping me and much of the board in the loop regarding newer products/ lesser known brands in Korea).  I am over 30 but I haven’t started picking out my coffin lining just yet (rose gold silk, plz) so be aware this isn’t really an anti-aging post as I don’t consider myself having “mature” skin (whatever that means).  As I go through reviews, I’ll also include my rational as to why I purchased a product if it wasn’t impulse and link any relevant posts from the sub that informed my purchase. \n\nI've decided to break up this review and present categories like a series.  This post will be centered around 1st cleansers, hydrating toners, and serums.  The second post will be centered around oils, moisturizers/occlusives, and masks. *Also, I will only discuss AB/ sub-related products*. While I went through a smattering of samples, they will not be discussed. All products discussed were used for at least 2-3 months, if not longer. \n\nAbout my skin prior to developing a skincare routine: \n\n- extremely oily\n\n- flaky under makeup (my makeup would separate in hours and have dry patches)\n\n- riddled with closed comedones (whiteheads)\n\n- bumpy skin texture (under the skin pimples)\n\n- uneven skin tone, hyperpigmentation (PIH)\n\n- icepick scars\n\n\n**1st Cleanser**:\n\n\n*Heimish All Clean Balm*\n\n- Ingredients: [Posted from CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2186231803.html) so take with a grain of salt as anyone can add or delete ingredients. \n\n\nI've been using this balm since February. My initial impression was satisfaction. It melted well (not as well as Clinique's Take The Day Off), a slight herbal/citrus smell which didn't bother me, and a lower price point than TTDO. The price is really the main positive of this product. I don't find it cleans as well as TTDO so I have to use more product to make sure everything is eliminated. Nowadays I don't even wear a full face or any makeup at all really except Heroine waterproof mascara and Beauty People Lip Tattoo. I usually let this balm sit on my face for a minute or two before going at it and it does remove most of these products. Into May, I'm still satisfied with this product. Sometimes I only use this cleanser at night if I wasn't wearing anything but sunscreen since it does the job and I've worn a full face and it does remove base makeup well enough (even though I need to use more of it). It'll also last a bit longer, I'm thinking 2-3 more months, so at least 6 months of use for me. I also like that this comes in travel size (I got a few from a Ohlolly.com promo).\n\n\nRepurchase? I'd likely repurchase TTDO if choosing between the two, yes TTDO is more expensive but I liked that it removed makeup easier, it melted better as well. \n\n\nFor my next 1st cleanser, I'll likely repurchase TTDO or make my own cleanser as a way to dupe Tatcha's oil cleanser (beautiful cleanser, only had a sample but loved the feeling). \n\n\n**Hydrating Toners**\n\n\n*Kikusamusane High Moist Lotion* (30 mL decant)\n\n- Ingredients: [From CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_5173202878.html)\n\n\nRemember mid-2016 when kikumasamune was on everyone's lips? I purchased a decant of this hydrator partially on the [buzz](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3tgula/a_letter_to_kikumasamune_high_moist_lotion/?st=j2jobol7&sh=17239e4e) created by the sub and other blogs.  This product seemed like a good way to target PIH and increase hydration for my dehydrated skin.  It took me about 2 months to get through my decant. I'm not gonna go through my use of this product because it's been discussed by this sub so much (do a google search). \n\n\nRather, I'll discuss why I ended up not purchasing a full size of this product. I ended up not purchasing a full size because by then I felt my skin didn't need what the Kiku was offering. I didn't get any significant lightening of PIH, brightening yes but I felt I could get brightening from other products. I could get hydration from other products as well.  And I suppose I just wasn't *impressed* enough to want to purchase it. This was also when I realized I get bored of products and the thought of purchasing a 500 ml product seemed so daunting to finish. LOL. \n\n\n*Hada Labo Albutin Lotion Moist*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Arbutin, Disodium Succinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Methylparaben, PPG-10 Methyl Glucose Ether, Sodium Hyaluronate, Styrene/VP Copolymer, Succinic Acid, Tremella Fuciformis Polysaccharide (from hadalabousa)\n\n\nI recently finished this product (mid-April) and I'm so happy I never have to use this product again. LOL. I purchased this product in December on ABX. I primarily purchased it because of its ingredient list and was interested in using a product with MAP and Arbutin to see if it could attack my PIH in anyway. Also, I felt it would be another good addition for my skin that leans perma-dehydrated. Little to no smell, watery texture, and economical. \n\n**Performance**: Overall, I was significantly disappointed by this product and the longer my time away from this product the more I'm able to realize why I'm disappointed.  It just didn't do anything. It felt like I was throwing cloudy water on my face most of the time. Cloudy water that wasn't even showing a difference in my skin. I would take days off from using this product and saw no difference in brightness to my face. I also saw no lightening of PIH. I expect my toners to hydrate *at least* and it seemingly failed on this front as well. I added another toner to back up this one but I don't like wasting product so I finished it. I found it as a good way to give myself lotion masks and to hydrate my legs. Essentially, this may be the most boring product I've ever tried. \n\n\n*Meishoku Extra Moisturizing Lotion Moist* \n\n- Ingredients: [From cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f35b176780.html)\n\n\nI purchased this toner around December from the r/abx with the Hada Labo moist.  I didn’t know what to expect purchasing this product but I did based on the ingredients. I was searching for a product that had ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids. I should also add that I was searching for a product that had the 3-1-1 ratio because my face does best with a pretty constant use of acids and I needed something that would deliver on the moisture front. \n\n\n**Performance**: I can't actually say much about this product which I don't know if that's good or bad. It's slightly thicker than the HL moist, it's more moisturizing than HL and I feel like it does more than HL ever did. I still enjoy using it after all this time and I may even repurchase. It absorbs quickly, has no discernible smell, and is pretty economical for the amount you receive vs how long it lasts. If the product ingredient listing is correct and I understand how each ingredient fits, this product may have the 3-1-1 ratio (plz, correct me if I'm wrong as I'd love to know for sure!).\n\n\n*PyunKyang Yul Essence Toner*\n\n- Ingredients: Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\nMy newest toner purchase.  I’ve been using this toner for about 3 weeks so I can only give a first impression.  My main interest in this toner was sparked by [Gothamista’s YT review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9_mJoK4gr4) of this product when she covered the 7 skin layer method.  I was interested in finding another hydrating toner to try out the method as I felt that HL was too thin and really felt more like I was patting ‘cloudy water’ on my face every day. \n\n\nAbout the PKY line: The PKY line was developed by the Pyunkang Oriental Medicine Clinic (info provided by Ohlolly.com).  It boasts a list of ingredients commonly found in these types of products but I was especially interested in milk vecht root extract, which is an extract that I haven’t come across much in products. (NOTE: I've been searching high and low for any clue of what this ingredient does topically, can't find anything.) I’m a bit of a lover for simpler aesthetics.  I like it when bottles are plainly labeled and look like they belong in an apothecary.  In this sense, PKY hits all my wants; sleek and simplistic design, electric blue bottle (hard plastic), and **no** dropper. \n\n\n**Performance**: What I expected from this product was hydration and I can say this toner delivered.  The liquid is slightly thicker than HL lotion moist but not too much.  I live in a high humidity area and we’re going into summer but I don’t expect to rotate this toner out of my routine.  I tend to only need 2-3 layers for the skin method when I’m using this toner. I’ve tried doing up to 7 but my skin calls it quits in absorption around layer 5. But I'm also wondering if this product just isn't as easily absorbed as meishoku. I think this product would be a great skin soother, since it comes across as so ...mild and inoffensive (if that makes sense). \n\n\nHave I seen a discernible difference in my skin using this product?  I don’t think so. I would notice more if my skin didn’t get the proper hydration it needed from this product but I haven’t seen that. \n\n\nMISC: There is no discernible smell but I’m not sensitive to smells.  The bottle is 6.7 oz which is a lot of product and likely this bottle will last me at least 8 months, making the price ($19) very economical. \n\n\nIf I didn’t think I’d have another toner waiting to be purchased, I’d say I’d repurchase this but I already have my sights set on toners by kyotosilk and swanicoco.  \n\n\n**Serums**\n\n\n*OST20*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Ascorbic Acid, Alcohol, Sodium Lactate, Butylene Glycol, Glucose, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Xanthan Gum, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Flower Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Glycerin, Zinc PCA, Panthenol, Niacinamide, t-Butyl Alcohol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ubiquinone, Diisopropyl Adipate (from Wishtrend)\n\n\nI'm going to be honest, I won't say much about this product because this sub seems to have a love+hate relationship with it. But I feel like a complete *sucker* for using this product when Timeless's Vit C formula exists. Reviews by [Holysnails](http://www.holysnails.com/2015/03/a-rant-on-osts-c20-and-c215-serums-and.html) and [Fiddy](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2017/01/04/vitamin-c-serum-101-timeless-vitamin-c-serum-review/) and [sub reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4edywb/timeless_vitamin_c_e_ferulic_serum_review_with/?st=j2joba2v&sh=f554f12e) should have had me clicking to Timeless's site. \n\n\nBut no, I tried OST20 first (at least I don't have to wonder) came away disappointed (easily oxidized, serum-like feeling, faint smell, and a bit tacky on the skin). If I regretted purchases this would likely be the ONE I regret most, especially after using Timeless (water-like feel to the skin, subtle scent, stabilized with vit E and ferulic acid, great pricing). NOTE: Please purchase from Timeless's site, while offered on Amazon I can't say for sure that is Timeless's vendor. \n\n\n*Stratia Rewind*\n\n- Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, 2-Dimethylamino Ethanol (DMAE), Panthenol, Hydrolized Rice Protein, N-Acetyl Glucosamine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Tamarindus Indica (Tamarind) Seed Extract, Hydrocotyl (Centella Asiatica) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA\n\n\nAgain, this is another product that is known enough in the sub that I don't really feel like I need to say much. I purchased this product based on the ingredients. I wanted something with niacinamide + nag and licorice. Also, I wanted to support an independent maker who I know was knowledgeable about skincare. I was really interested to see what this product would do for my skin. NOTE: I purchased before stratia dropped the use of biokelp ferment so I've never tried the newest formulation. \n\n\nFor skin feel, this product was slightly oily but sank in well enough. I found it slightly hydrating/moisturizing but not heavy. It really did help with providing a boost of moisture to my skin while being soothing. \n\n\n**Performance**: Overall, I didn't see any significant change in my skin except for moisture/hydration. My PIH was not lightened and I didn't see significant brightening and really that's what I wanted. \n\n\n*Hungarian Water Essence*/*Mizon Hyaluronic 100 Serum*\n\n- Ingredients (BELIF): Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Officinalis(Sage) Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Peucedanum Graveolens (Dill) Extract, Alchemilla Vulgaris Extract, Rose Extract, Poncirus Trifoliata Fruit Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, *Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, *Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, *Nepeta Cataria Extract, *Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Leaf Extract, *Baptisia Tinctoria Root Extract, *Stellaria Media (Chickweed) Extract, +Alchemilla Vulgaris Leaf Extract, **Equisetum Arvense Leaf Extract, **Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Leaf Extract, **Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Triethylhexanoin, Tromethamine, Sclerotium Gum, Ammonium Acryloyldimethltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Trisodium EDTA, ***Fragrance, Citronnellol, Limonene. *Napiers Original Formula. **Napiers Aqua Formula. ***Fragrances of Natural Origin.\n\n- Ingredients (MIZON): Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Copper Tripeptide-1, Butylene Glycol, Sclerotium Gum, 1,2-octanediol, Ethylhexyl-glycerin, Tropolone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Carppyl/capric Triglyceride,Hydrogenated Lecithin, Stearic Acid, C12-c20alkyl Glucoside, C13-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholesteryl Hydroxystearate, Cholesterol, Ceramid 3, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Betula Platpyhlla Japonica Juice, Portaluca Oleracea Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, Amica Montana Flower Extract, Artemisia Absinthium Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Gentiana Lutea Root Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Rasberry) Fruit Extract, Beta-Glucan, Adenosine, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA\n\n\n**Performance**: I'm putting these two together because I felt like they acted as similar products. Very inoffensive serums with little to no scent. I couldn't pinpoint to their overall effect but I will say that when I started mixing them together before application I saw a def increase in the ...bouncy-ness of my skin. I can't explain it and I'm little miffed that separately they didn't perform but together I loved the effect. I refuse to purchase extract water as I got a deluxe sample size from Sephora (Belif got me on the moisturizer train already) and Mizon did very little for my skin alone so both were a dud in my opinion. \n\n\n******\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nI suppose I should discuss my skin now. Overall, I'm pretty happy with where my skin is although I think I'm gonna need laser work for some PIH or start on tret. I don't get flakes even in the face of all the actives I through at my skin. I barely purge (except for retinol) and I don't break out really. When I do breakout, it's usually from products/ environmental, not hormonal. I guess I have a semi-glow, although IRL I just look semi-sweaty or really shiny with makeup on. I'm not as oily and I usually don't get oily until about 4PM now and my makeup no longer separates. \n\n\nI think what's made the largest difference is introducing a hydrating toner. Before this I cleansed and moisturized but hydration was a key element that I wasn't getting. Adding hydration was such a wonderful step towards aiding my skin and I really think that in those who are new to AB, learning the importance of hydration is critical in understanding your skin. ",

        "body": "Awesome reviews thanks so much! Just a note, I've been struggling with Pigmentation for years and have tried just about everything except laser. What I have found to work the most for me  has been a monthly Glycolic peel (20%) coupled with regular (2-3 times a week) exfoliating and of course niacinamide and Alpha arbutin and sunscreen that blocks against HEV and IR  to stop new pigmentation from forming. It's a nightmare to maintain  but it was the only thing that works. I did try tret, the 0.5 one but it was really really drying on my skin and darkened my pigmentation unless I exfoliated which made it more dry. Such a pita.",

I have issues with my makeup separating/flakes becoming more visible as well :( and I have yet to find a satisfying solution for it. \n\nI'm normal, but lean dry and I feel like I've never seen my moisture barrier fully restored, which is probably leading to the separation of my makeup.. Do you think the hydrating toner made the difference for your makeup as well? Have you been using the same face makeup throughout the usage of these products?",

They don't always appear as \"ceramide \\_\\_\", there are other names for them, such as:\n\nHydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, Myristoyl/​Palmitoyl Oxostearamide/​Arachamide MEA, Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide, Hydroxypalmitoyl Sphinganine, [Safflower Oil/​Palm Oil Aminopropanediol Esters](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/safflower-oil-palm-oil-aminopropanediol-esters), etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo today I wanted to make a list of products that are easily overlooked when searching for ceramide skincare, because many people are only looking for the word \"ceramide\".

The only time HA is good is if you have a special event or a wedding where you only need to have your skin look plumped and it's best for only a few hours but it's definitely something you do not want to eat everyday!!!

For a while bimatoprost worked but again my pressures creeped up.\n\nThe only medications she thought might work were Vyzulta latanoprostene bunod which uses NO2 to lower pressure, and a new drug Rhopressa and Rocklatan netarsudil which can cause retinal detachment and Corneal verticillata which is like a cataract and macular degeneration.\n\nA friend of mine came to me and offered to take me to a naturopathic doctor. I refused at first because I don't believe in crystals, magnets, herbs and all that hippy dippy nonsense.\n\nMy friend was however prepared to die on that hill and issued a challenge, they would buy me lunch, pay for the visit and if the doctor didn't help more than my OD did then they would give me $100.00\n\nThey were adamant this person broke all the stereotypes.\n\nI figured what heck, I have one more medicine I am comfortable trying and then we have to move on to more invasive surgeries.\n\nSo not sure what to expect I told the doctor I really didn't want any treatments unless they were evidence based.\n\nThe doctor left for about 10 minutes and returned with some studies they printed out for me:\n\n-----------------\n\nAntiglaucoma Activity of Aqueous Methanolic Zingiber officinale Extract on Carbomer Induced Glaucoma in Rabbits.\n\nAbstract:\n\nhttp://www.informaticsjournals.com/index.php/jnr/article/view/82\n\nFull PDF:\n\nhttp://www.informaticsjournals.com/index.php/jnr/article/view/82/81\n\n\n--------------------------\n\nEffect of Orally Administered Zingiber Officinale on the Intra Ocular Pressure of Experimental Rabbits\n\nAbstract:\n\nhttp://www.ajol.info/index.php/ijhr/article/view/47911\n\nFull PDF:\n\nhttp://www.ajol.info/index.php/ijhr/article/view/47911/34280\n\n\n----------------------\nThe Role of Transforming Growth Factor β in Glaucoma and the Therapeutic Implications\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23322881/\n\n----------------------------------\n\nTargeting Transforming Growth Factor-β Signaling in Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28169917/\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe Role of TGF-β in the Pathogenesis of Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma\n\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22101332/\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom other studies it shows that Ginger is a natural TGF-β inhibitor, but yet there are no commercial TGF-β inhibitors on the market for glaucoma.\n\nTrabecular mesh network which lets fluid flow out of your eyes, it seems that TGF-β causes this tissue to stiffen and reducing it allows it to become more elastic and allow fluid to drain easier.\n\nIn rabbits at least it seemed to work.\n\nThey told me that they had successfully treated many glaucoma patients this way.\n\nI was instructed to buy disposable plastic pipettes, a stainless steel garlic press, coffee filters, fresh whole (not pre-sliced) organic ginger root, and distilled water.\n\nI was to freeze the ginger first as doing so broke down the cell walls and allowed more juice to be pressed from it.\n\nI was to boil a pot of water to disinfect the garlic press and a small coffee mug before use, and then set them aside to cool.\n\nThey stressed disinfecting was extremely important because of the risk of bacteria contamination.\n\nI was to break off a piece of ginger large enough to fit in the garlic press, insert a coffee filter into the garlic press to filter out the larger pieces of ginger root, and to squeeze until all the juice.\n\nI was told to mix about 1/8th of a teaspoon (about the amount of two or three green peas) of distilled water in with the ginger juice, swirl it around in the coffee mug and use a pipette to suck it up, and then distill 4 drops in each eye and keep my eyes closed for a few minutes and repeat this process again.\n\nI was told that I had to keep this frozen when not in use to prevent bacteria and fungi from growing in it as there were no preservatives.\n\nI was told to do this both morning and night.\n\nIf you keep your eyes closed long enough there is no burning sensation, only a slight feeling of pleasant warmth.\n\nI turn the pipette upside down so the solution pools in the base and place it in the mug and return it to the freezer to inhibit bacterial growth, so I can use it in the morning as well after it thaws out from holding it in my hand.\n\nDoing this and doing this alone has dropped my pressures well below 20 in either eye, and shows no sign of pressures creeping back up like I experienced with the other medicines.\n\nThe studies above do show it works in rabbits, and my own pressure tests show it does work.\n\nThere are also loads of other anecdotal reports of others who use ginger (albeit with additional ingredients) achieving similar results see:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7UPUP5KAqM\n\nI asked my doctor about those other ingredients these other people were using and was told not to use them, only to use the ginger.\n\nI am not a new age type person, and I believe in evidence and results and this really does work as evidenced in animal studies and my own pressure checks.\n\nSadly this information is not tolerated or allowed to be discussed openly.",

I chew raw ginger everytime I have a throat ache and it clears it right up.\n\nThe big tragedy is that Rockerfeller medicine essentially eliminated a lot of folk or herbal medicine knowledge. We got brainwashed into thinking that synthesized chemicals are better than what's already available to us by way of Mother Nature. We're from the earth, of the earth, the earth provides us with everything we need to be healthy and happy. Humans existed for thousands of years without pharmaceutical drugs, and we got alone fine without them.\n\nGlad you were able to find something that helped your glaucoma.",

        "body": "Happens to be that a lot of medicines are synthesized compounds which are chemically isolated from plants that originally were used as part of natural remedies. A commonly known one is that people used willow bark for headaches before the salicyclic compounds in it were isolated and used to make aspirin.\n\nSo the fact that ginger has something in it that may do the job isn't too surprising. Perhaps it's just disappointing that it's not documented better in studies. Then again like some others have said, if the pharma industry doesn't see how they could make a \"big sell\" on something (perhaps people being aware of the natural source of an active compound) then a lot of the times they just don't pursue it.",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea?

    "body": "I have **combination skin with an oily T-zone and dry acne prone cheeks laden with PIH**, an aftermath of 2020 and some wrong skincare choices. Since I am acne prone, I try to avoid perfume/fragrance, alcohol and essential oils in my products. \n\n*Processing img thx4k3izjnf61...*\n\nI have tried a bunch of sunscreens and these are the **best ones** I have settled on after a long 2 years of trial and error and time/money/effort invested. I have tried to include the swatches of all the four sunscreens and the white cast whereever it was possible (suncros) for the camera to capture. Lets begin.\n\nProduct Name: **Suncros Soft Matte Finish Gel, SPF 50, PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rave\n\nAvailability in India: Easily Available in India, offline and online.\n\nIngredient list: Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\nSunscreen type: Physical / Mineral \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3zgtf9w6knf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0796b78286edcc7126df7421f34ae34c3ae1c7c8\n\nExperience & opinion: I have been using this sunscreen since almost one year. I used to use UV Doux before this for as long as I can remember, but had to stop using it as my skin got really sensitive and I had damaged my skin barrier. \n\nYou definitely cannot use the recommended two fingers of sunscreen with this one as it gets really heavy and suffocating. I tried layering it in small amounts (maybe just one fingertip at a time), let that settle and then apply another fingertip. I could only do two fingertips with this one. It did work for my extremely sensitive skin at that time and miraculously it was even calming and healing for my active acne and the PIH post acne was really minimal. The texture is in between a cream and a gel as can be seen in the picture. I totally understand why people detest it so much, the heavy suffocating feeling is a put off. I am not going to lie, it is heavy, feels like a suffocating layer on your face and is uncomfortable but you get used to the feeling once you see that its actually working for your extremely sensitive skin when nothing else does. You have to properly blend it in, take a minute or two to actually spread it on the skin. I have tried to photograph the white cast this one gives immediately post application. but once it settles in 30 minutes or so, the white cast is almost negligible and gives a primer finish (I am NC 43-45 for reference). I don't use makeup so I don't know how it would perform under makeup. The reapplication is difficult. I blot my face a lil before I apply this and again it takes a while to settle which is irritating if you are out and about. I could never reapply this more than once. It is sweat proof, tested it in peak of summer. This is the only zinc oxide based sunscreen that did not dry out my cheeks. \n\nAll said and done, I can't seem to make it work as my stand alone sunscreen as two fingertip amount is just not going to cut it when you are on all sorts of actives. Hence, since I have healed my skin barrier now and can use chemical sunscreens again, I use it over my cheeks (an area where my PIH is the worst) layered over my chemical sunscreen, after it completely dries. It's the perfect sweet spot for me and helps with PIH.\n\nRepurchase Status: Holy Grail (HG). Already repurchased twice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **Bello Photostable Emugel Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rave ❤\n\nAvailability in India: Easily available offline and online.\n\nIngredient list:\n\nKey Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol, Ethylhexyltriazone Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyltriazine, Diethyl amino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate.\n\nOther ingredients: Purified water, Dimethicone and Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl phosphate, Ceteth-10 phosphate, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Myristyl Myristate, Octyldodecanol, Caprylic Triglyceride, Pentaerythirtyl distearate, Phenyl trimethicone, Vitamin E acetate, Carbomer copolymer, Disodium Edetate, Trolamine, Sodium polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Methyparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben, Isobutylparaben\n\nSunscreen type: Chemical\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dr24pvoaknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f726d323339bee404855990ab043e2a3b051acc2\n\nExperience & opinion: I have been using it everyday since approximately 4 months. The texture is creamy and you have to work it in for like 2 minutes into the skin. Immediately post-application, the sunscreen feels greasy to touch and looks oily but it gets absorbed into the skin in about 10 minutes and leaves a dewy finish which never goes away. I really like the dewy healthy glow it gives me. I can actually use 2 finger amount of sunscreen and it doesn't leave a white cast on my dark skin tone. If it gets into your eyes, it does sting. I can assume that dry skinned people would loooooove this in the winters. If you are combination or oily, I feel you can completely skip the moisturiser step when using this in summers. Would be perfect for inclusion in a minimal routine in the AM. On reapplication, it does leave a little bit of white cast on the sides of the face where we tend to have the peach-fuzz which will go away with a little bit of rubbing. Overall, this is the best budget sunscreen easily available in India which doesn't make us look like we have dressed up for a meme.\n\nRepurchase Status: HG, WRP. Already repurchased thrice. I will be trying out Photostable Gold SPF 55 in the summer, maybe it will replace this one. If not, I will always come back to this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **Biore UV Smooth Kids Milk Spf 50 PA++++**\n\nReview Type: Rave ❤\n\nAvailability in India: Availability is a serious issue. Used to get it from Dokodemo pre-pandemic. Haven't been able to source since.\n\nIngredient list: Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Glyceryl Behenate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Distearate, Sodium Acrylate/​Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Paraffin, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Ceresin, Isohexadecane, Arginine, Lauryl Methacrylate/​Sodium Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polysorbate 80, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Dextrin Palmitate, Agar, Petrolatum, Succinic Acid, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, BHT.\n\nSunscreen type: Chemical\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gjsnx8acknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e3e74e3ba70e6471b63c4d83bd3d41c2e876eab\n\nExperience & opinion: I had been using it everyday in dry summer days. Where I live is not very humid and that's why I think this one works so well for me. The texture is very aptly described as milk since it feels like a thick emulsion and spreads into nothingness into the skin. I can use the recommended amount of sunscreen with this one and it doesn't leave a white cast at all. It gets absorbed into the skin within 2 minutes and leaves behind a comfortable breathable layer of moisture on your skin. It does not dry down matte. It doesn't irritate my eyes. Its just so perfect for my combination skin even on my oily T-zone in peak summer days.  Reapplication is such a breeze. I have reapplied it in a taxi, in my office, before a meeting without any downtime. I just absolutely love everything about this sunscreen except that I think it has been discontinued and I am crying over the loss of my only true HG sunscreen. If anyone from Biore is reading this, please accept my plea and bring this back into production!!!!!\n\nRepurchase Status: HG forever. Although on the look out yet again for something that would match this one's status!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **The Blessing Tree Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50 PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rant\n\nAvailability in India: Available on Amazon.\n\nIngredient list: \n\nKey Ingredients: Octyl Methoxy Cinnamate, Oxybenzone, Titanium Dioxide, Octocrylene, Avobenzone, Zinc Oxide.\n\nOther ingredients: Aqua, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Diisopropyl Adipate, 1, 3, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Acrylates /​ C10-30 Alkyl Acrylare Cross Polymer, Propanediol, Diethylhexyl Sryngylidene Melonate, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Xylitylglucoside (and) Anhydroxylitol (and) Xylitol, Niacinamide, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyl Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Perfume.  That was a task to type!!!!!\n\nSunscreen type: Hybrid\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/52ec0gwdknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8dd848f71d4a3939aa1b3ea6f13df4428170a9b\n\nExperience & opinion: I have had this for around 1 1/2 years now. But I never had the courage to put it on my face due to the infamous \"perfume\" in the inci list as I had a compromised barrier and could tolerate only physical sunscreens. All said and done, this has served well as an excellent body sunscreen which doesn't break the bank and provides me excellent protection. It is non-greasy unlike the other body sunscreens on the market. The white cast disappears within 5-10 minutes and you are good to get dressed and head out of the house. I apply it on all the exposed areas of my body - neck, upper shoulders, arms, hands (I don't feel guilty reapplying it even with the frequent hand washing as its relatively affordable + acts as a moisturiser for me) and feet. \n\nHowever for the sake of this review, I mustered all the courage I had to try it on the face but alas it did not suit me and caused me CC's by evening. It spreads well, leaves a white cast on skin which disappears in about 5-10 minutes, although the white residue along the hairline just doesn't disappear. I had to rub it excessively, almost rubbed it out to get it out of my peach fuzz! The finish on this sunscreen is not ultra matte and nor is it dewy to touch, its almost in between which is comfortable for combination and oily skin types. I was worried that this might get drying on my cheeks as the day progressed due to the zinc oxide content but it did not get dried at all. While I was typing the inci list, I realised it has Niacinamide in it!!! Yet another amazing ingredient to be present in this sunscreen. All in all, I would say if you don't have sensitive/sensitized skin and are okay with the \"O\" sunscreen filters, this is an excellent sunscreen.  \n\nRepurchase Status: Might repurchase for body. Not suitable for my face.\n\nThis review took me almost a month to write and photograph, but I am ultimately happy with the final write-up. I sincerely hope you enjoy reading this! I have tried to include everything based on the rules of this sub, but still if you have any questions, do hit me up.\n\nI will make another post of the sunscreens which didn't work for me and would include the likes of Cipla Rivela tint sunscreen, Hada Labo UV Perfect Gel, Skin Aqua UV Moisture Gel, Photostable Insta,  Aroma Magic Mineral Sunscreen and The Mom's Co. Mineral Based Sunscreen.",

I’m excited to try it as a hydrating toner. \n\nMulti-Quench feels great on the skin, I’m a sucker for glycerin and it has a nice texture. \n\nMilk Peel has a nice light texture, and is very mildly hydrating. \n\nI will update you all once I finish the bottles. \n\n____________\nMulti Acid Milk Peel: \n\n-Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Olivate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, C13-14 Isoalkane, C11-12 Isoalkane, Phytic Acid, Malic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Lactic Acid, Lipase, Protease, Squalane, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, C15-23 Alkane, Hydroxyacetophenone, Phenoxyethanol, Tricaprylin, Glyceryl Oleate, Ethylhexyl Polyhydroxystearate, Tetradecane, C13-14 Alkane, Decyl Glucoside, Maltodextrin, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Sclerotium Gum, Polyglyceryl-4 Oleate, Carrageenan, Silica.\n\nHalf & Half Fluid Moisturizer: \n\n-Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Propanediol, Isopropyl Myristate, Ethylhexyl Olivate, Squalane, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Ceramide NP, Ceramide AS, Ceramide NS, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide AP, Hexapeptide-11, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Triolein, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Glyceryl Oleate, Undecane, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glyceryl Dioleate, Caprylyl Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Tridecane, Betaine, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Citric Acid, Sodium Phytate, Sodium PCA, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Lactate, PCA, Sodium Benzoate, Serine, Alanine, Palmitic Acid, Glycine, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Butylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glutamic Acid, Lysine HCl, Threonine, Arginine, Proline, Tocopherol, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20.\n\nMulti Quench Plumping Hydration Serum:\n\n-Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Polyglutamic Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ectoin, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Fruit Extract, Erythritol, Phenoxyethanol, Propanediol, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tocopherol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide.\n\n\n",

I don’t know what it is, but I just vibe with that brand so much (except their sunscreens, which fall a bit short for me personally). I say this all the time, too, because I know people get so suspicious of comments on Reddit and people being paid plants or something, but I’m absolutely not affiliated with them at all! LOL Shit, I wish they supplied me with products! \n\nAnyway, Half & Half is my new favorite thing!! I’m really loving it. I do run oily, so I can use it alone during the day and be good. Or, I layer it under a heavier moisturizer at night just to amp up hydration and moisture. \n\nThe Multi Acid Milk Peel is interesting as well. I haven’t used it as frequently yet, since I just finished a procedure, so I’ve been pretty gentle and boring lately. But I do like it for a nice exfoliator. \n\nMulti-Quench I’ve been using for awhile and it’s great as well. But I think I love Half & Half better! I’m finding that I absolutely love milky toners now.",

I bought a bottle of it cuz I was out of my Ordinary Glycolic Acid that I use on my body and also my Dr Dennis Gross Peel Pads for my face (was waiting for their sale to restock my big box. Been using these for a couple years). Now I’ve been using the Prequel on my face and body since January and plan on sticking with it. My skin looks and feels incredible. More hydrating than the DDG pads but still leaves that beautiful glow, pores are looking good, and my skin just looks nice and bouncy. AND it hasn’t irritated my rosacea (I also use Tret every other night). And for my body- no reappearance of KP on my legs or backs of arms, no booty acne, no ingrown hairs on my bikini line or underarms, knees and elbows are super soft, all of my skin texture in general is smooth af. And as long as it’s not crazy hot out, I can skip deodorant as long as I pat a bit of it under my arms. It’s light years better than the Ordinary acid\n\nAnd I was thinking about picking up these other two products. The Half and Half in particular seems like would be perfect as a daytime moisturizer in my ridiculously hot and swampy weather\n\nTheir Gleanser, Vit C, and Urea moisturizer are already at HG status for me",

    "body": "**Liquid Gold Review, or: How I learned overexfoliation is a bad thing**\n\n**TL;DR:** If your moisture barrier is damaged, this stuff will seriously change your life. Support an up-and-coming indie shop and repair your moisture barrier, all without breaking your wallet.\n\n**Background:** I recently upped my skincare game considerably through the infinite wisdom and patience of r/SkincareAddiction and r/AsianBeauty. I’ve always been both a science nerd (currently working myself through a Masters program to be a physician assistant) and a product junkie, and those two things have gloriously collided over the last few months to the benefit of my skin! The AB side bar has an excellent list of blogs, one of which I fell way down deep into is The Acid Queen. Alli, who runs the blog, is a seriously impressive DIY’er, which allowed me to get involved in her guinea pig pool for testing product formulations she was currently tinkering with. I’ve spent the last five weeks testing her moisture barrier repair moisturizer, Liquid Gold, and here are my thoughts! The formatting of these sections is shamelessly ripped from bloggers whose reviewing formats I admire: Fiddy Snails, Skin & Tonics, Fan-B, Snow, and of course, Her Majesty The Acid Queen Herself ;)\n\n**What it’s supposed to do:** Liquid Gold is a moisture barrier repair moisturizer/emulsion. (For more info on what a moisture barrier is, see Skin & Tonics excellent moisture barrier post linked in the sources.) Liquid Gold takes your thinned out, red, overexfoliated, stinging, weakened skin and makes it supple, bouncy, strong, and able to tolerate some serious heavy-lifting from acids and actives. It accomplishes all this with the magic of CERAMIDES *oooh ahhhh*\n\n**How to use it:** We’ve got two recommended options here. The first is a thin layer all over your face as the first occlusive step of…well, however many of those you have. The second is a thicker layer as a deeper moisturizing sleeping pack of sorts. I’ve been going with option 1, twice a day every day, AM and PM. Its consistency is slightly thicker than a serum, but not as thick as a gel cream or oily despite the ingredients list (more on that in a moment). It’s BRIGHT yellow-orange from the sea buckthorn, but spreads pretty easily and only leaves the tiiiiniest yellow cast after I’ve spread it in. However, my paleness makes Casper the ghost look like a tanning bed addict, so I imagine on most other skin tones it wouldn’t be visible at all. One of the things I love about this product is how quickly it dries down. I’m (gleefully) looking down the barrel at 15+ steps in my PM routine, so anywhere I don’t have to wait for dry time, I’m a happy camper. I don’t wear makeup often, but I’ve brought it out a number of days to see how Liquid Gold plays under makeup. I’m pleased to say it holds up just fine, without makeup settling into fine lines, caking, or otherwise disintegrating throughout the day.\n\n[**Here's some photos of it in action!**](http://imgur.com/a/knjp4)\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (Aqua), Propylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Polyglyceryl-3 Methyglucose Distearate, Rosa Mosqueta (Rose) Hip Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Seed Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Fruit Oil, Panthenol, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Squalane (olive-derived), Cetyl Alcohol, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA.\n\n**Notable Ingredients:** Oh, man…all of them?! This ingredients list is STRAIGHT FIRE if we are talking moisture barrier repair. Let’s break that down, shall we? I’m going to limit my highlights because otherwise I will literally never finish this review.\n\n**Ceramide Complex** (Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP; Phytosphingosine; Cholesterol): The Beauty Brains, another fabulous “science of skincare” blog, has a great discussion of ceramides (see sources for link) and describes them so: “Ceramides form a kind of water-proofing barrier in the upper layers of skin. They’re not only critical for helping skin retain water but they also help repair the skin’s natural barrier and regulate cells. Ceramide production dwindles with age which can result in dry skin, wrinkles and even some types of dermatitis.” The other important thing to know about ceramides is that they are team players. Ceramides without fatty acids and cholesterol won’t get you very far. Specifically, ceramides penetrate best with a mixture of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% fatty acids. So maybe you’ll find a product with ceramide floating around in the ingredient list, but good luck finding one with all three players…and if you do, cross your fingers they’re in the optimal ratio. Except that’s exactly what we have in Liquid Gold. Hell yes.\n\n**Niacinamide:** Why hello, my old friend! I’ll let the Queen herself explain the wonders for niacinamide: “One of the most studied skincare ingredients, niacinamide does everything: smooths fine lines and wrinkles, increases ceramide and fatty acid synthesis, regulates skin cell turnover, fades hyperpigmentation, evens skin tone, and has powerful anti-inflammatory properties.” Naturally then, it seems like niaciamide is in errything these days, but who knows how much is in there? Niacinamide is most effective at 3-5%, so unless the percentage is disclosed, we’re left stacking niacinmide products to reach that threshhold. Liquid Gold has 4%, which happens to be the same amount you’d get if this ingredient was included in a Curology prescription. Jackpot.\n\n**Sea Buckthorn:** Again, from The Beauty Brains: “[Sea buckthorn is] known for being rich in a number of bioactive compounds, including the following: vitamins A, B1, B2, C, D, K, and P; omega 3, 6, 7, and 9; 43 lipids, organic acids, amino acids, folic acids, tocopherols, flavonoids, phenols, terpenes, tannins, [and] 20 mineral elements.” Okay…but what does all that do for your skin? Well, we’ve got some studies that show all that goodness adds up to improved wound healing, protection from UV damage, and increased collagen production (see sources for link).\n\n**Rose Hip Oil:** High in oleic and linoleic acids, both of which are polyunsaturated fatty acids important for the integrity and regeneration of skin cell membranes. More moisture barrier magic going on here, my friends.\n\n**Okay, but seriously…**everything in this ingredients list is AMAZING. And rightly so, that’s the whole idea behind DIY in the first place: if you make it yourself, you know everything is there for a reason without any fluff or fillers.\n\n**How it worked:** And here’s where the other part of the title of this post comes into play. I have a long and glorious history of overexfolating my skin because…well, basically because that’s what I thought I was supposed to do. Physical exfoliants, all sorts of acids, inappropriately high strength retinoids…I would throw them all at my face at once every single day until literally my whole top layer of skin peeled off in sheets in the shower and I was shiny and red as a cherry. Even normally gentle products would sting like the devil, and I never questioned it because I honestly thought that’s how it was supposed to work. I’d fry the life out of my skin until I couldn’t handle it (so like 3-4 straight days of all this), then take a break for a week, maybe less, and then I’d start all over again. It was a roller coaster, let me tell you, and I did this for years. \n\nThen I found this post on FutureDerm that totally blew my mind about setting a schedule for building tolerance to retinoids (see sources for link). So I mapped out my schedule for all 24 weeks and promised myself I would be patient. I went without actives for over a month, then took another crack at one night with lower strength Tazorac, my drug of choice. Disappointingly, I still peeled like a snake for the next three days, despite babying my skin before and after the Tazorac. The next week, the same thing. I was beginning to doubt the wisdom of the retinoid tolerance schedule.\n\nEnter Liquid Gold.\n\nI got on Alli’s testing list and got a bottle in the mail soon after. I am not exaggerating when I say this is literally the most amazing shit I have ever put on my face in my life. Redness starting receding within days. A night with retinoids was no longer followed with peeling, pain, redness, or stinging — all of my hallmarks of a compromised moisture barrier. I tentatively and slowly moved through increasing the frequency of the retinoid. Once, twice, three times, four times a week, two interminable week periods per increase. So far, so good. I can feel fairly confident that Liquid Gold is the responsible party here since the rest of my non-actives routine stayed stable while I was tinkering with how to reintroduce them after my hiatus. Gradually, I added all my actives back in so that now, here’s what I’ve got going on my face: 1) Tazorac 0.05% gel 4x/week; 2) Curology 0.009% tretinoin, 9% azelaic acid, 1% clindamycin every night; 3) Paula’s Choice Resist 2% BHA morning and night; 4) Timeless 20% Vitamin C+E Ferulic Acid serum (AM only).\n\nEvery time I wash my face, I think today will be the day I finally overdo it and start feeling my barrier damaged again. BUT NO. My skin feels strong, bouncy, resilient, and looks glowing. My husband pokes me in the face, nods knowingly, and declares, “Chok chok.” He’s right. Now, I’ve been throw actives at my face like there’s no tomorrow and my face takes it like a champ. Eventually, I’m hoping to add in an AHA and up my Tazorac to 0.1%, but my schedule says I’m not allowed to do that for another few months. I’m glowing like the goddamn North Star thanks to all those actives, and I can keep coming back for more thanks to the almost surreal talents of Liquid Gold.\n\nI started to panic a bit the closer I got to the end of my bottle since this was a DIY formula since I absolutely had neither time time nor inclination to whip up a batch myself and didn’t know what I would do when I ran out. The day before I was about to email Alli and beg her to keep making me some forever in exchange for my first born child, SHE OPENED HER OWN SHOP ONLINE!!! This is the best news my skin has ever had. I immediately purchased a 60 mL glass pump bottle of Liquid Gold for $24 from Stratia, The Acid Queen’s shop website. After having such a fabulous experience with this, you better believe I threw Rewind, her DMAE serum, into my cart with a quickness. \n\n**Conclusion:** This shit is my life now. It let’s me go active-crazy without unduly compromising my moisture barrier and makes my skin feel stronger than it has in my entire life. It’s affordable, pleasant to use day and/or night, well-formulated, conscientiously packaged, and made in-house by a fellow skincare junkie on the other side of the country.

This is my cautionary tale.  I am eczema prone (on body) so I have a naturally weak moisture barrier. Last summer with all the snail, ceramides and HA my AB game was so good,  I started using a pro retinol serum nightly and some AHA and BHA. I could not believe how well I tolerated it. I was not new to actives.   I was shedding a lot of stuff out of my pores, but no irritation.  Nice and plump.  Suddenly my face got sunken and older.  It was my moisture barrier.

I just wanted to add some  impressions and my skin type.\n\nI have dry, sensitive, always-red skin with hormonal acne. I tested Liquid Gold on half my face for two weeks and it didn't cause any visible changes. No increase in acne, no miraculous redness reduction. I find it very minimally moisturizing. My skin still feels dry and tight after letting it sink in (which I agree happens quickly) and I have to follow it with a heavier moisturizer (or three.) There is just a tiny amount of stickiness and little to no slip after it dries/absorbs.\n\nI, too, have been trying to find a way to use actives without over-exfoliating. Daily use of a mild BHA and AHA has proven too harsh in the past, so I've been increasing in frequency very  slowly and now I'm up to every other day with no discomfort or peeling, even when combining BHA and AHA and using my stronger products.\n\nI'm really happy with Liquid Gold and see myself using it indefinitely. The price and ingredients speak for themselves, and the packaging is really nice too. One last thing I just thought of: I was showing it to my mom and she had an irritated spot on her hand from a cut or something, so I put this on that spot and she said it was amazingly soothing.",

    "body": "To me, price tag doesnt matter. Its whats INSIDE that matters. and i feel like i see a lot of people ignore the ingredients of their skincare and are getting scammed. on both the low dollar tree end and and the high end.\n\nNow i am not one to be scared of anything with a scientific name like Hydrogen oxide or call everything 'Chemicals'. But if a product claims to have a certain ingredient and its the LAST thing on the list under even fragrance and preservatives, i have questions. Or for what ingredients they claim to have they then package improperly like Vitamin C and Retinal in clear bottles.\n\nSome brands at the DT have proven time and time again to just not use enough of an active they claim they have in a product and its just a waste of my $1.25 (im looking at you BOLERO) while others have shockingly good ingredients like skin nutrition botanicals.\n\nAs a long time DT lover, this newer brand BPure is giving me Bolero vibes with some of their products, and thats an insult.... For example the new glow up serums. I took a look at the ingredients and they just dont line up with the claims on the package.\n\nHere are the ingredients for the strawberry one:\n\nWATER, GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, PEG/PPG-17/6 COPOLYMER, POLYSORBATE 80, HYDROXYACETOPHENONE, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, CARBOMER, SODIUM ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, ISOHEXADEC- ANE, NIACINAMIDE, CAPRYLHY-DROXAMIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, DISODIUM EDTA. FRAGRANCE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, SODIUM HYALURONATE. SALICYLIC ACID, ACACIA SENEGAL GUM. LINALOOL, FRAGARIA ANANASSA (STRAWBERRY) FRUIT EXTRACT, CITRIC ACID, CARMINE (CI 75470)\n\nThis claims to have AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) and just just does not. it has citric acid which is technically an AHA, but its at the end of the list and in that amount is not doing anything. and the strawberry extract can be considered a 'natural aha' but again, thats not the claims and its so low it wont work like an AHA.\n\nHaving most the actives listed under fragrance means its likely under 1%. The Salicylic acid has to be like 1-2% to work. At MOST this serum is hydrating. but a very basic hydration at that. Which isnt bad, but not what it claims at ALL.\n\nBut then there are brands like skin nutrition and their claims on their products and the ingredients are actually shocking. The actives they claim are there in their true form (not like the AHA lie in the last one). They have correct percentages (and often TELL YOU the % for a lot of things). While they might not be the most life changing product, based on formula alone, they weirdly outclass a lot of brands and their claims for $1.25\n\nWhile i enjoy trying all the new products that come out, when i see items like the BPure strawberry smoothing serum, i get frustrated. They clearly can make and sell quality products like skin nutrition. It feels like they have started to pump out poor performing products that probably have a better profit margin since they dont contain very much of the more expensive ingredients and its \"just a $1.25\" so people scoop them all up since its viral.\n\nIs anyone else seeing this with recent launches? And BPure has put out some great products too, but they are so hit or miss with their claims and how they line up with whats in them. Just because i shop at DT doesnt mean i want to over consume. and i know its easy to just try everything, but it adds up. \n\nwhat viral DT beauty products have you noticed like this? what are your thought on this? Do you just trust what the product is claiming? What are your thoughts?\n\n",

        "body": "Buying DT beauty/skincare is  an option for those who enjoy frequently trying new products, love to experiment, and prefer an inexpensive/budget shopping experience. Over the years I have tried some DT products but have left behind most I had initially considered.  Because after checking the ingredient list, I have concluded that many  products simply won’t meet my needs. Fragrance, niacinamide, floral/fruit extracts are a no. Instead I stick to the OG skincare/haircare/cosmetic products that have never disappointed and I know work for my skin.  I just buy these on sale, stack my coupons, use store promotions and CVS ExtraBucks to restock the products I have already learned work best. For example, a bar of Vanicream soap might be as low as $4 after coupons and promotions. A Maybelline mascara might cost $5. That’s the same cost as four DT products at the current 1.25 price point.  Sure, I could buy 4 DT mascaras for that same $5, but they likely won’t be as effective or as consistent as a Maybelline product. However, if I saw my favorite Maybelline mascara at DT I would certainly buy at least two!\n\nWe can choose how to consume and we can all become smarter consumers. If an active ingredient is dead last or very far down the list, there’s a good chance that ingredient has such a low percentage that it will not produce appreciable results.\n\nAn educated DT consumer is a happier consumer. ❤️",

        "body": "I agree with a lot of what you have said. I think that those specific watermelon, strawberry, Avocado, etc. bpure serums are sort of useless and definitely unnecessary. Not Worth even your $1.25. And so I totally agree with that. \n\nI also agree that there are definitely products that don't have amounts of ingredients that are even going to be effective just like you said. That being said, I think a lot of people hear \"Dollar Tree\" and think, there's no way there's anything good in there or anything in an amount that's effective, which just isn't necessarily true at all. And so I'm glad that you also mentioned a couple brands that are doing good things cause I actually think there are several brands that have extremely effective combinations additionally. \n\nOne thing I thought would be important to point out for those who aren't as adept at ingredient list reading, It isn't always just about how high up in the ingredient list the ingredient is. Some things just have to come in very small percentages for the best situation for your skin. People think they want retinol to be the second ingredient, but we don't usually want like a huge percentage of retinol or something else. AND sometimes a large amount of retinol isn't even helpful if it's not actually being delivered into the skin with proper mechanisms. So an amount of retinol or Vitamin C or whatever underneath 1% could still be effective depending on the situation. \n\nThe whole vitamin C thing is super complicated as well because there's different types of vitamin C that require different percentages to be effective. And also it's just a not a very stable ingredient and so there's a lot of confusion there. \n\nHowever, that being said, I don't think we should write off all clear bottles that have what we consider sun sensitive ingredients like retinol. Studies have shown that while some ingredients prone to deteriorating in sunlight, that is specific to sunlight and not just like the light within the store or within the warehouse. And so in actuality, most of the product is not going to be exposed to very much sunlight at all because it would be made in a factory, stored in boxes, transported in boxes. And then stored in the store until you take it home. And then you have to decide where you're going to put it. It probably experiences minimal deterioration in such circumstances. So saying oh the retinol etcetera in this product is completely ineffective because it's in a clear bottle is over-simplistic and negating a lot of the good. \n\nOverall I agree with you but I just wanted to add some of my thoughts.",

I think it's very important people take the time to learn what different ingredients are for (retinol, AHAs, BHAs, etc.), which ones should be in dark bottles/stored in certain temperatures, avoid damaging/irritating your skin by mixing ones that shouldn't be applied together, etc. Your skin is an organ so I think it's important to keep educating yourself and protect your skin!",

I’m currently using the glow recipe watermelon moisturizer dupe which has niacinamide. I don’t know the quality of the niacinamide nor the percentage but for 1.25 I’m willing to try it since I’m not relying on it solely for an active ingredient. I prefer moisturizers with niacinamide when I can find them at DT. To me this moisturizer is meh - the packaging is nice since it’s a glass jar and it’s 2 oz. But it’s a very “wet” texture which I don’t like because then I can’t apply while my face is still damp which is customary for me. It takes a while to dry too. \n\nAs a side note - does anyone know if you can or need to exfoliate while using Adapalene?

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae](https://preview.redd.it/04x8cx1jvsy81.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db29ff28ad9fbcd3ff56a158d60e872ed63cb538)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco.

I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\nand that's all from my side! I know its not much but then again kangaal haalaat mein kharidaari mushkil hai 💀. anyway, here's a list ss that I do want to try once this lot is finished:\n\n* sunscoop sunscreen serum (only if dermaco doesnt work lmao. really intrigued)\n* Face shop sunscreens (itne variants . ek try karne ka mann hai 😖)\n* beauty of joseon rice ss (stock mein aaja bhai 😫)\n* missha sun aqua gel and essence (bas aise hi lol)\n\nI've also tried the neutrogena ultra sheer, episoft , a few banana boat ones but way long ago so I don't clearly remember them to give the verdict on them. just if I haven't repurchased them, consider that they didn't work well for me.\n\nhope this was informational and you guys enjoyed! if you still have any other questions related to the product above, feel free to comment!",

Even when i was  in the flight my skin did not dry out at all ! \n\n\n     ▫️The days i used hydrating serums my skin looked so plump and glowy the next morning,  I couldn't stop admiring it XD \n\n\n\n\n\n\n🔹ARE THERE ANY ALTERNATIVES ?\n\n\n       ▫️ Rosehip oil , followed by any moisturiser and slugging . This provides overnight results.\n\n \n\n      ▫️Rosehip oil pretty much provides the same effect and a small bottle of 30 ml runs a really long way. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🔹  COMPARISON BETWEEN MARULA OIL AND ROSE HIP OIL\n\n \n\n\n\n___ |Rosehip oil|Morula oil\n|:-|:-|:-|\nfatty acids*****|more Linoleic acid and less Oleic Acid|more Oleic acid and less Linoleic acid\nantixodiants| |higher in antioxidants\ntexture|lighter / sinks into the skin|thicker / feels heavier\ncomedogenic rating|low|high\nbrightening properties ( scars )|yes|no\nantibacterial properties|yes|no\n\n\n\n 🔸*****\n\n\n\n\n *🔸you have oily or acne-prone skin, you likely have low levels of linoleic acid in your skin and therefore can benefit from a facial oil that’s high in linoleic acid*\n\n\n*🔸As a general rule, if you’re acne-prone or oily, you want an oil that’s high in linoleic acid. Whereas if you have dry skin, an oil that’s high in Oleic acid will help you more*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🔹 REPURCHASE STATUS \n\n\n        ▫️ WNRP\n\n\n        ▫️ Its a great moisturiser but rosehip oil provides the same effect , doesnt leave a heavy feeling post application. \n\n\n       ▫️for dry scaly patches i swear by the slugging method",

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

I’ve been using it twice a day and within a couple of weeks, my eyes have stopped reacting to makeup, serums and SPF.

Pictured above.\n\n**Fragrance:**  ~~Yes. An extremely artificial flowery scent. Dissipates, but I find it slightly annoying while applying.~~. None. \n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:** Got this when my previous gel moisturiser got over. I had already used the other 3 and I started using this with fairly high expectations. And I was / am disappointed. **It's not bad. It moisturises**. But I was expecting a jelly like moisturiser that sinks in easily while still packing a moisture -filled punch. And this is not that. It takes way longer than I'd like to sink in.  I either have to compromise on the quantity I use and the moisturised feeling or go around feeling oiler than I would like. It's the kind of product that does everything to some level, but none of them spectacularly or to an above average level.\n\nAs far as healing for barrier damage is concerned, I get way faster results from the other three Bioderma moisturisers and I pretty much never touch this for that purpose after the initial trial period.\n\nThis does have a few de-pigmenting ingredients, but so far I've not been able to see anything results that I can directly attribute to this product.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:**  Moisturised feeling. I've used this with actives that are known to cause dryness and faced no issues. It can handle drying actives. No glow noticed. No standout effects.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:**  Can't think of anything. If you start using this with low / zero expectations, you'll probably like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status:**  Jury's still out, haven't decided. But as of now it's a **Will Not Repurchase.**\n\n\n***Additional Notes on whether the product is fake****\n\n**Tl;dr: Old tube is genuine, NOT FAKE.  Confirmed by brand too. Review still stands**\n \n\nOn 24th October 2023\n\n1. Some people's experiences does not coincide with mine in important ways such as fragrance and I'm now wondering if mine was a fake, I contacted Bioderma but haven't received any info yet. But I'll update and or delete the review when I do get it. \n\n2 Of 5 people, 4 can't smell anything from their product and 1 can (but doesn't sound similar to my description. & Bioderma still hasn't replied :(\n\nOn 1st November 2023\n\n1. Bioderma replied on Instagram that my moisturiser is genuine, By the time they replied, I had already repurchased another tube from Tira, to check for myself. The new tube has already arrived and they are identical in all ways. Including from the same batch 😅. \n\n2. New tube arrived with bioderma samples, which jogged my memory. Old tube had also arrived with samples. Two of which I still have unopened. So chances of old tube being fake is 0.\n\n2. But the smell was still different. My old tube smells like a flower. My new one doesn't smell of anything, unless I put copious amounts on my arm and put my nose in it and even then it smells like a teeny bit chemically, Thats all. I can understand why most people say it smells like nothing, because that's what I would have said too, if I wasn't looking that closely. \n\n3. Anyway, I was breaking my head trying to figure out why my old tube is has that smell, And then it struck me. I had a perfume leak incident in my travel kit many months ago. Most of the stuff is replaced and I don't still have that perfume, so I'd kind of forgotten. The tube was new then and I didn't use it enough to note the frag or lack thereof. I think the gel or top of the packaging still smells of the perfume and that's why I was mistaken. \n\nSo that was much ado about nothing, apologies. \n\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Atoderm Intensive baume\n\n**MRP:** 786 for 75 ml. Available in 45ml,  200 ml tube and  500 ml pump bottle.\n\n**Texture:** White Cream.  Pictured above.

It doesn't smell exactly like grease but it reminds me of grease. It's a dusty, chemically smell that I associate with Bioderma moisturisers. Like if you've smelled any of the Bioderma moisturisers, all except the gel-creme have the same DNA, though they are not exactly the same. It's not repulsive, but it's there. Does dissipate after a minute or so.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  I bought this on a whim after a few friends raved about it. They were so so so right. This was the second bioderma cream moisturiser I used, so I knew it would help with barrier issues but it does so much more. When I first used this, I had oily to combination skin and I never ever used cream moisturisers by choice. I had a misconception that since I was an acne / clog prone, oily skinned person, that I need to stay as far away from cream moisturisers as possible. This is the moisturiser than changed my mind.\n\nIf I want a one and done PM product when I'm too tired or too lazy or too whatever, I reach for it.\n\nIf I want a one and done travel moisturiser, this is the only one I pack.\n\nSuper dry climate, this is it.\n\nAirplane dryness, this is it.\n\nSlight tingling, or signs of barrier damage incoming, this is it.\n\nBarrier damage, this is it.\n\nDerm procedures, this is it.\n\nBut in even other scenarios such as humid climate or AM routine, where this is NOT my ideal or go-to product, it still does a decent job. It holds its own. It can be greasy but hey it can be worked with. It does an amazing job moisturising without clogging pores for me.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:**\n\nMoisturised feeling.  Super soft skin. Heals Barrier overnight depending on damaged your skin is. It's my tried and tested barrier recovery product.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The heaviness, I guess. Upto combination skin or barrier-damaged oily skin, it's fine. Very oily skinned people may want to avoid this for general use.\n\n**Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** Have repurchased 3 or 4 times. Will continue to repurchase till it's discontinued. Love it. **Holy Grail.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Bioderma Sensibio Forte Rapid soothing cream\n\nMRP: 1499 for 40 ml.\n\n**Texture:** White Cream.  Pictured above. Heavy feeling on the skin.\n\n**Ingredient List :**  [Aqua/​Water/​Eau](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum)](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/paraffinum-liquidum), [Beeswax (Cera Alba)](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cera-alba), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Cetyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-alcohol), [Glycyrrhetinic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycyrrhetinic-acid), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [Palmitic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/palmitic-acid), [Stearic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/stearic-acid), [Sorbitan Sesquioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitan-sesquioleate),[Tocopheryl Acetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tocopheryl-acetate), [Mannitol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/mannitol), [Xylitol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/xylitol), [Rhamnose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/rhamnose), [Fructooligosaccharides](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/fructooligosaccharides), [Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laminaria-ochroleuca-extract), 🌟[**Allantoin**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/allantoin)**, 🌟** [**Sodium Pca**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-pca), [Caprylyl Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylyl-glycol), [Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylic-capric-triglyceride), [Pentylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentylene-glycol),[1,2-Hexanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/1-2-hexanediol), [Carbomer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/carbomer), [Triethanolamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/triethanolamine)\n\n**Fragrance:**  Yes. A different version of that greasy smell.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  This was first prescribed by my then dermatologist for application after a MNRF session. And since then till Atoderm intensive baume came into my life, this was a re-buy. **Slightest irritation, and I used to apply it**. I have urticaria, this helped with many of my allergic reaction episodes. **Skin will feel greasy, but it was soothing at the same time.** As soon as the greasiness disappeared, I used to reapply. **This was never a daily use moisturiser for me.** I kind of used it like medicine. As and when needed, at the quantity, I needed. However the soothing it provides does overlap with the Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume and I've not repurchased this in more than a year. I simply use that, wherever I previously reached for this. I have a feeling this is a gold standard product for certain sub set of people who need a rich, soothing moisturiser, but for most of us, this can be a pass.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:** Moisturised feeling. Very soothing on irritated skin.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The heaviness, I guess. Upto combination skin or barrier-damaged oily skin, it's fine. Very oily skinned people may want to avoid this for general use. And the price. Damn expensive for 40 ml.\n\n**Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** As of now, I don't miss it in my routine, so **WNRP.** Considering the price and the benefit from the others, unless you have sensitive skin or are advised by your derm to try this out, I'd skip it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Cicabio Crème\n\n**MRP:** 1399 for 40 ml\n\n**Texture:** Green tinged Lotion.  Pictured above. Feels heavy for a lotion.\n\n**Ingredient List :**[Aqua/​Water/​Eau](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Fructooligosaccharides](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/fructooligosaccharides), 🌟[**Zinc Oxide**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-oxide)**,** [Sorbitan Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitan-stearate), [PEG-30 Dipolyhydroxystearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-30-dipolyhydroxystearate), [Butylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butylene-glycol), [Polyacrylamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyacrylamide), [C13-14 Isoparaffin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c13-14-isoparaffin), [Laureth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-7), [Copper Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/copper-sulfate), 🌟 [**Mannitol**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/mannitol)**,** [Sodium Hyaluronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-hyaluronate), 🌟 [**Xylitol**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/xylitol)**,** [Zinc Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-sulfate), [Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Vine Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/vitis-vinifera-vine-extract), [Rhamnose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/rhamnose),[Laureth-3](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-3), 🌟[**Asiaticoside**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/asiaticoside)**, 🌟**[**Madecassic Acid**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/madecassic-acid)**, 🌟** [**Asiatic Acid**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/asiatic-acid), [Hydroxyethylcellulose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethylcellulose), [Acetyl Dipeptide-1 Cetyl Ester](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acetyl-dipeptide-1-cetyl-ester), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylic-capric-triglyceride), [Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laminaria-ochroleuca-extract)\n\n**Fragrance:** A subtler version of that greasy smell, a teeny bit herbal, to be this dissipates the quickest of all the bioderma moisturisers.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  😍 I love it. I love it only slightly lesser than Atoderm Intensive Baume and mostly because it's comparatively way more expensive. 😅.  I wouldn't use this daily, there's no need, but definitely a barrier saviour product. I wake up with such soft glowy skin even when it's damaged, like the healthy part of my skin feel look glowy even if skin damage texture is still there to an extent.\n\n***Comparing with baume, since I use them both for similar reasons :*** I originally had the impression this was heavier than Atoderm Intensive Baume and that it forms a suffocating seal on the skin. This isn't true under normal circumstances. It does feel suffocating when barrier is SEVERELY damaged but not otherwise. I applied this on half and the baume of half my face to check if there's any major difference and no. **No functional difference noticed.**\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:** Soothing, Healing, Moisturising, it does it all.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The price. And for a lotion consistency product it's quite heavy.\n\n**Repurchase Status**: When I started writing this review, this was going to be a WNRP, because between all of them, I'd only repurchase Atoderm Intensive Baume, but ngl, the more I thought about it, I find myself wavering. **This is a WRP.** I don't know when, but I'll probably come back to this at some point.\n\n# \n\n# Comparision\n\n***Ranking based on Use Case***\n\n||1st Choice|2nd Choice|3rd Choice|4th Choice|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|As an AM Moisturiser|None of them|Intensive Gel-creme|Intensive Baume|Sensibio Forte|\n|As an PM Moisturiser|Intensive Baume, Cicabio, Intensive Gel-creme, Sensibio Forte||||\n|Time taken for Healing|Cicabio|Sensibio Forte, Intensive Baume|Intensive Gel-creme||\n|Versatility (Can work for any of the above use cases in a pinch)|Intensive Baume|Intensive Gel-creme|Cicabio|Sensibio Forte|\n\nI've ranked them after considering the following factors (these are the most important deciding factors for me personally).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***As  AM Moisturiser:***\n\n**I would use absolutely none of them as an AM moisturiser.** That doesn't mean they can't be used as such. it's just that none of them absorb in minutes or 'set' when you use a normal amount or slather it on. They're all occlusive but not the matte kind. Intensive Gel-creme is the easiest one of them to use as an AM moisturiser.\n\nThis gif will show you how long it took for them to sink into my arm, which is way dryer than my skin. But caveat is that I don't always use a AM moisturizer (infact I very very rarely do), but i when I do, I slather it on like below. If you use a teeny teeny weeny bit, you might not face this issue. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/isq9941kddwb1.gif\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***As PM Moisturiser:***\n\nI can't actually decide I love them all. Atleast I love Intensive Baume, Sensibio Forte and Cicabio, but there's nothing to complain about the gel creme either. ✨ **Skin just looks so nourished with all the Bioderma moisturisers.** ✨  If you use only a tiny amount, all of them will sink in by morning. I like to slather them all on. And how much is absorbed by morning completely depends on how damaged my skin is. If I catch signs of barrier damage early and use them, they'll sink in. If I've completely wrecked my skin, there will be residue when I wake up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***On healing***\n\nTime taken for healing: shortest to longest, ranked above. But honestly, most people don't need a moisturiser stronger than Intensive Baume even for barrier damage.\n\n**Note on the likeliness of clogging pores and causing acne: I've personally not had breakouts from any of them. None of them caused acne for me.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\n👉🏾 All 4 moisturisers are good.\n\n👉🏾 For most people Sensibio Forte & Cicabio is not necessary. Unless you have facial wounds, surgery on your face, intensive derm procedures, very bad rosacea and are prescribed or recommended these, I'd say skip them.  People with sensitive skin may like them though.\n\n👉🏾 If you have oily skin, you might like Bioderma Intensive gel creme.\n\n👉🏾 Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume has ceramides, fatty acids and cholesterol. Ratio unknown, will link if I can find anything.\n\n👉🏾 I've seen a fair number of people mention that baume is heavy and breaks them out in this sub. Something to be aware of.\n\n👉🏾  If I had to suggest only one product, from the above, hands down it'll be Atoderm Intensive Baume and it's best cost - benefit wise too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Im going to buy the cica +arnica to try out next. The Atoderm Creme Ultra doesn't seem interesting enough to me to want to try. If I can get a mini or sample somewhere just to update this post, I'll do that.\n\nETA2: After writing so much I still like left somethings out , so I'm editing to add them. Apologies 🙏\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs with any other review, YMMV",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F18 (umar badh gayi but dimaag nahi 💀)**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , acne (pustules, fungal and cystic) pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae ](https://preview.redd.it/fnjipguox9ma1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d880ff6b482ade3f03237375ef02cdd64fb4e3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl  Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a  fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\n* **The Derma Co.** **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum** \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredient list** : Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less 😖 if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would  get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation. I found this really mediocre.\n\n* **Axis-Y Complete No-Stress Physical Sunscreen \\[SPF 50+ PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1450 for 50ml (bought for Rs.999 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily combo skin types. those with dry skin like mine, might find it a bit more drying. good one for sensitive skins since it has a lot of calming ingredients as well!\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick white cream. fragrance free but has very strong ayurvedic smell. matte finish. physical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Zinc Oxide, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propanediol, Titanium Dioxide, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Caprylyl Methicone, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Disiloxane, Niacinamide, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Water, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Stearic Acid, Aluminum Hydroxide, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Copaifera Officinalis (Balsam Copaiba) Resin, Tocopherol, Squalane, Allantoin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5\n\n**filters** :\n\n* zinc oxide (mineral filter)\n* titanium dioxide (mineral filter)\n\nthis had been on my 'to buy' list for such a long time! and I finally got it during a march beauty barn sale! when I first tried it, I was really skeptical since it gave me a pretty bad whitecast and smelt so weird. I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop 😭. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :(  but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nupdate : this ones a hard no for me. is it calming? yes. but the whitecast is too much. and when i sweat it literally looks like I'm secreting milk from my skin  (~~nipple)😭😭~~\n\n**rating** : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/​PPG-10/​1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool 🤤 only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure! in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty 😖 I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao 😌 so you can guess I go out a lot heheh. I feel like this one is getting over sooner than others in my ss ki theli 😫 but either way, if you find a good deal on it, blindly add this to your cart and order it. you wont be dissappointed!\n\nrating : 5/5 and WRP on reduced mrp only.\n\n* **Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun : Rice + Probiotics (SPF50+ PA++++)**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1530 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1200 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : dry, sensitive, acne prone and combination\n\n**texture and appearance** : creamy white lotion (ya nasty-). unscented ( ha, ha , aur socho ashleel cheeze 🤡)\n\n**ingredients list :**   Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Water, Glycerin, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Behenyl Alcohol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Sodium Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Water, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/​VP Copolymer, Polyisobutene, Silica, Caprylyl/​Capryl Glucoside, Sorbitan Oleate, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Bifida Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacillus Ferment,Streptococcus Thermophilus Ferment\n\n**filters :**\n\n* uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nthis deserves all the hype it gets on the net. my current and forever HG sunscreen (unless they change formulation). seriously this ticks all the boxes . no whitecast? check. great filters? check. doesn't make you face look like you rub pan grease on it? check. it absorbs so well and is more moisturizing than some of the moisturizers out there. obviously, wished we would get more quantity for the price paid but itna criticise karne ke baad bhi, brands toh behre hai 😔and on reapplication, doesnt feel like im doing the 100 layers challenge lol. plus , I don't feel regret when applying it these days, cuz no fear of sunscreen melting during winters (#rajailife) . *taareef karu kya uski, jisneee tujhe banayaaaa✨\\~*\n\n**rating :** 5/5 and forever HG\n\n* **Benton Mineral Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 15g (haalat kharab biros). got it at 30% on beauty barn\n\n**For skin types** : normal and sensitive skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : a white stick. that's it. kind of a really thick lotion like texture. unscented and smol. mineral sunstick.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Coco-caprylate/caprate, sunflower seed wax, propylene glycol dicaprylate, H-di/trimethylol hexyllactone cross polymer, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, titanium dioxide, dicaprylyl carbonate, Synthetic fluorphlogopite, vinyl dimethicone, microcrystalline wax, aluminum stearate, polyhydroxystearic acid, purslane extract, centella extract, sodium hyaluronate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, sodium Acetylated hyaluronate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, polyglyceryl-4diisostearate/polyhydroxystearate/sebacate, silica, alumina, pentylene glycol, allantoin, panthenol, Glycerin, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Xylyl Glucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Glucose, Glyceryl Caprylate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Stearic Acid, Tocopherol, Purified Water, 1, 2-hexanediol, ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**filters** :\n\n* titanium dioxide\n\nthis one came around the same time as the tocobo sunstick on beauty barn so being the ✨phisool kharchi wala baccha✨, I bought both of them. unfortunately , this one was a big letdown. how tf can a sunstick leave a whitecast? this one is a great example. first off, it requires a lot of pressing and dragging across the face to dispense , so not fond of that, especially when I have active acne. secondly, it legit looks like someone rubbed fair and lovely mixed with water on my face 💀. its not waterproof, expensive for the quantity you get and gives a disappointing finish and result. I'm not particularly sure about protection against sun on this one but oh well. also piddu si stick hai so kind of cute but lootne wala hai lmao\n\n**rating** : 2/5 and WNRP\n\n* **Tocobo** **Cotton Soft Airy Sun Stick SPF50 Pa++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1550 for 20g (bought at 1100 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily, combination, acne prone skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale blue long cylinderical like stick. has a really pleasant and soft floral fragrance . leaves a matte fininsh and doesnt feel greasy on apllication. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list :**  Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Niacinamide, Tromethamine, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Pentylene Glycol, Polysilicone-15, Vigna Radiata Seed Extract, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Extract, Sophora Flavescens Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum Root/Stalk Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Oenothera Biennis (evening primrose) Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Seed Oil, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Fragrance\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* titanium dioxide (physical filter)\n\nprobably the only sun stick that comes even close to the isntree sun stick. this gives such a good matte finish without any greasy feel . plus has cute floral smell to it that doesn't transfer to your skin or anything. and damn what a bang for a buck. probably the closest dupe for the isntree one. the only con is that it kind of pills after the 3rd application and rubs of oily after a while. if you are a person who touches their face every once in a while (like my dumbass), you might find it a bit uncomfortable. that being said, most of the times I just blot the grease away after 3-4hrs of application and apply another layer afterwards. sun protection wise, it does a good job! my forehead is the area that is the most prone to getting tan and it looked quite even toned after 3 weeks of consecutive use. one of my most favorite sticks (😏)\n\n**rating** : 4.5/5 and lets seeee\n\n* **Neutrogena beach defense sun stick water + sun protection SPF 50+**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs 1260 for 42 g (got it at Rs. 900 from amazon)\n\n**for skin types** : honestly, none lmao. I used it as a body stick most of the time with how oily this was. but can be used by anyone ig\n\n**texture and appearance** : whitish yellow stick. has a fruity kind of smell. really oily and greasy on first application that doesn't absorb or goes away after a while.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Polyethylene, Isohexadecane, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Ozokerite, Paraffin, Synthetic Beeswax, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Neopentyl Glycol Diisostearate, Dimethicone, Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Fragrance, BHT\n\n**filters** :\n\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n\noof this was an impulse purchase that I regretted later on. mind you, this is a great sunstick for your body but definitely not for your face . not to mention its waterproof . but the tapti garmi really just melts everything in its way and this is no exception. bhai itna chip chipa lagta hai i dont even feel like putting this on just because of the MoIsT feeling it gives. unless you're going to a pool or beach (as it suggests duh) , if you're okay with feeling like [that peanut butter baby](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.ie%2Flife%2Ffamily%2Fthis-peanut-butter-baby-is-sure-to-brighten-up-your-day-31499579.html&psig=AOvVaw0Qc7SXcD436wP5Ywrn_yJv&ust=1678212392776000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCIDzt77yx_0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) , then you can give it a try. it  does provide a good amount of product for the price and is a solid waterproof one fosho. but nahi jhela jata for some reason 😣😣😫\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\nme after buying and trying all of these to find my HG\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zzjpjrbly9ma1.gif\n\nbut it was fun doing this in a span of a few years and I finally got one that fits all my boxes . the BOJ one is seriously godsent for me ✨✨~~lets just ignore that it makes my wallet cry every time I buy it .~~ But id rather spend more on stuff that works than just hit and trials lmao. also I've gone past my obsession on using sun sticks as a whole since they require quite a lot of pressing while applying and the application just irritates my acne a lot 😫 imma finish the ones I have but I have no intentions on buying anymore from any brands (even though the minimalist and earth rhythm ones look good 🤡)more reviews to come! ill be doing one on stuff my dad will be bringing from the U.S in the next few weeks so do let me know if you'd like a follow up on those too! (~~why do i treat my posts like a sitcom😭).~~  and as always, any other questions, comments are always welcomed and so are dms!\n\nbyeeee 💖💖",

        "body": "also my post exceeded the word limit so here's some more lmao :\n\n   \n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF      50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n   \n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte      Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable      UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB      filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV      filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB      mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change",

    "body": "Here is the routine that my skin has come to make peace with since the last 8 months after years of perfunctory experiments it endured. I have also incorporated the  **Be Minimalist's AA & TXA serums since 20/02/2021**  into my routine,so they are being reviewed here while the CTM+sunscreen products have gained my trust enough to be holy grail(s)! \n[You can fill yourself in regarding my skin type and concerns by reading this](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/lmjcxq/look_what_arrived_in_the_mail_today_upcoming_post/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and consider the routine to be nothing greater than anecdotal evidence :)\n\nPS: The length of the post might make it look like I accidently published a scientific paper on the Internet but I have compensated for that by using the '🐳' emoji as pointers because nothing emotes joy like a whale mindlessly sprouting water into the ocean :P\n\n🔹 **MORNING ROUTINE** 🔹\n\n🐳 Cleanser:  **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel**\n\n   \n   🐳Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   🐳Serum: **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%**\n   \n\n   🐳Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night             Repair**\n\n\n   🐳Moisturizer:  **Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**\n   \n\n    🐳Sunscreen :  **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++**\n\n\n\n🔹 **NIGHT ROUTINE** 🔹\n\n    \n   🐳Cleanser :  **Cera Ve Salicylic Acid Cleanser**\n\n   \n  🐳Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   🐳Serum:  **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA**\n\n\n   🐳Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair**\n\n    \n    🐳Moisturizer:  **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion**\n\n    \n    🐳Replaying that moment when I called my class teacher 'mummy' in the 7th grade before wrapping up the day is a cult ritual.\n\n\n\n\n🔵 **CLEANSER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water (Aqua), Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Cocoglucoside, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Chloride, Ceteareth-60 Myristyl Glycol, Glycol Palmitate, Glycerin, Peg-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Propylele Glycol, Sorbic Acid, Disodium Edta, Fragrance, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract.\n\n🐳 **Application** : Just like how *normal* people apply a face wash. Normal is the operative word here because ain't nobody washing their face like actors in a commercial,that's clearly abnormal.\n\n🐳 **What works** : This was recommended by my dermat after a bout of eczema 2 years back and I absolutely swear by it. It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured. [I brought mine from this one.](https://instagram.com/_vivanka_chennai?igshid=5brie36vc4w2)\n\n\n\n🔵 **TONER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **DermaFique All Important Toner** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260\n\n🐳 **Application** : I got this transferred into a mist spray bottle because I quite enjoy the feeling of being spring irrigated. So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you! Rest your eyes for a bit,it did endure quite a bit of a strain with this one :P",

It was a recommendation from a Thai friend, apparently it’s super popular in SE Asia. It’s manufactured by the same parent company and has a similar ingredient list with Bifida Lystate as the 2nd ingredient. \nThe only con for me is that it has alcohol in it.

    "body": "So I always thought that ferments were a \"Asian skin care\" thing. But ever since getting some high end Western skin care as gifts, I noticed that many of them actually have a lot of fermented/yeasty ingredients in them.\n\nBut I can't find much on the \\~science\\~ or evidence behind why ferments can be good for your skin. But I also wonder, since ferments aren't really a thing that majority of consumers in the Western market are looking out for (like fragrance, rose water, coconut water, rosehip oil, fruit/veggie extracts that have label/experience appeal, but aren't necessarily good for skin), why would these huge companies bother putting ferments in their expensive skin care if they didn't have evidence that they do SOMETHING?\n\nI especially am curious because AB/Korean beauty are sometimes looked down upon as just being trendy and not using ingredients that are scientifically proven to be truly beneficial for skin.\n\nDo you think ferments are legit?

Fermenting antioxidant rich ingredients such as ginseng, green tea etc. breaks down the antioxidants/complex molecules that are beneficial to our skin into smaller molecules, which allows it to be absorbed into the skin easily. Not only that, yeast/bacteria ferments produce additional metabolites (AHAs, peptides) that provide additional benefits such as whitening, hydration, skin repair, you name it!\n\nEdit: forgot to put my favorite fermented product!! I love the Manyo Factory Galactomyces Niacin Special treatment. :) \n\n2nd Edit: here are the links to some scientific literature articles on fermented cosmetics which were found through PubMed! You do need access to the database if you want to read them in its entirety, but you can get some brief information on the topic just through the abstract.\n\nFermenting red ginseng enhances its safety and efficacy as a novel skin care anti-aging ingredient: in vitro and animal study.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23126662\n \nEvaluation of tyrosinase inhibitory and antioxidant activities of Angelica dahurica root extracts for four different probiotic bacteria fermentations.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254340\n\nSkin resistance to UVB-induced oxidative stress and hyperpigmentation by the topical use of Lactobacillus helveticus NS8-fermented milk supernatant.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28598022\n\nBifidobacterium-fermented soy milk extract stimulates hyaluronic acid production in human skin cells and hairless mouse skin.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12637786",

I've tried Nivea Soft, Cosrx Honey Ceramide Full Moisture Cream, Holika Holika Skin & Good Cera Super Cream, and FAB Ultra Repair Cream, all within the past few months, and none of them have felt right for my dry, acne-prone, and sometimes dehydrated skin. Nivea Soft changes its ingredients depending on the country, and with the amount I move, I don't want to patch test every time I buy a new tub. Holika Holika was good, but a bit sticky, and I'm wary of the botanical extracts in the reformulation. Cosrx was too greasy, while FAB was too dry. It's a veritable Goldilocks and the Three Bears situation but with moisturizers instead of porridge. \n\nEnter my \"just right\" moisturizer: Missha Near Skin Total Ceramide Cream. This is the first moisturizer I'm actually happy enough with to repurchase, and that says a lot about what a great product it is. \n\n**Packaging:** I'm a sucker for Glossier's minimalist white and millennial pink vibe. So it's no surprise that I love the packaging of the two Missha products currently on my shelf. The Total Ceramide Cream comes in a 50ml white metal tube with a small plastic screw-on cap and black text. It would probably look starkly medical if it weren't for the pink bands near the end of the tube that make it vaguely minimalist chic. Do I purposefully nestle this product between my Milky Jelly Cleanser and my pink and white Missha sunscreen? Absolutely. \n\nAesthetics aside, the tube is actually one of my least favorite things about the cream. While it's a nice size, and I appreciate the fact that it's not plastic, it's like a tube of toothpaste in that it flattens out the more you use. I still have about half a tube left to go, but I expect it'll be difficult to get every last drop of moisturizer out. I also have read some reviews where people's tubes ripped open when they got bent. I have a trip coming up in two weeks, and will be interested in seeing how it fares in my carry-on.\n\n**Ingredients:** A cosDNA analysis of this product shows it to be relatively clean. The three acne triggers that pop up are Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, and hydrogenated vegetable oil, which rate 1, 2, and 3 respectively. As for good things, the cream contains three different types of ceramides: Ceramide 3, Ceramide 9, and Ceramide AP, as well as shea butter and meadowfoam seed oil, all of which are towards the top or middle of the ingredients list. So as long as you have no sensitivities with any of the ingredients, this should be a pretty good moisturizer for anyone with dry skin or who is trying to repair their moisture barrier. \n\nOne really interesting thing about the Total Ceramide Cream is that is contains Maltobionic Acid, a PHA. PHAs are chemical exfoliants that are supposedly as effective as AHAs, but without the sensitizing effects, due to their larger molecular structure ([Source](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/exfoliant/polyhydroxy-acid.html)). So theoretically, this cream should have some brightening properties, just like an AHA. I was definitely worried trying this out, because even though PHAs are gentle, the idea of putting any kind of chemical exfoliant into a product marketed for people with compromised moisture barriers made me wary.\n\nHere is the full ingredients list as printed on the side of the box: \n\nWater, Glycerin, Caprylic ICapric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Olivate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Sorbitan Olivate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Ceramide NP, Phytosteryl/octyldodecyl Lauroyl Glutamate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Phytosphingosine, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide AP, Carbomer, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Maltobionic Acid, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Tromethamine, Lecithin, Trideceth-10, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium EDTA, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n**Price:** $14 on Jolse, which works out to about 28 cents per milliliter, making this the second least expensive moisturizer I've tried thus far. \n\n**Use and Performance:** The texture of the Total Ceramide Cream is unlike any moisturizer I've used before. It's closest to the pudding-like texture of the Holika Holika Skin & Good Cera Super Cream, but it's slightly stiffer, and a little less sticky. Its appearance is also a bit translucent--not as opaque as a typical cream, but nowhere near as transparent as a typical gel. \n\nI actually had a really difficult time with this moisturizer the first few days, and thought it was going to be a repeat of my Cosrx debacle all over again, where the moisturizer just sat in a greasy layer on top of my face refusing to sink in. I immediately started frantically googling PHAs and dry skin, because I react pretty badly to glycolic acid, and was worried that the maltobionic acid was the culprit keeping my skin from absorbing the moisture. In the end, I decided to stick with it and give the Total Ceramide Cream a slightly longer trial run before calling it quits.\n\n I'm very happy I pushed through though, because on the fourth day, my face finally stopped looking greasy as the cream sunk in and made my skin soft and moisturized. I think the difference is that I let my last hydrating layer dry down a bit more than usual before applying a facial oil or Stratia Liquid Gold followed by the cream. It might have also been just a weird weather-related fluke, but I haven't had any problems since then. This product leaves me thoroughly moisturized, and it's very rare that I need to reapply it throughout the day, which I've had to do with other moisturizers (I'm looking at you, FAB). My skin definitely looks brighter, but I'm skeptical about chalking that up to the maltobionic acid when I've recently seen some really great progress on my acne and PIE with Finacea. So maybe it's the cream, maybe it's the azaleic acid. Either way, I'm just happy the PHA in the cream isn't getting in the way of its moisturizing abilities. \n\nIn terms of texture, there's no sticky residue left on my face, making it appropriate for daytime use. It leaves a dewy finish, which is perfect because I rarely wear complexion makeup but still like a slightly luminous effect. And speaking of foundation, the few times I've used makeup over the Total Ceramide Cream, I've had no issues with pilling. \n\nThere are a few drawbacks: we recently had a cold snap in the UK, and I found that I had to reapply this moisturizer a bit more than I might have with Nivea or Holika Holika. I've also noticed that if I go too heavy on the azaleic acid, it's not quite enough to help with the dryness either. So it's definitely not for extra dry days, but works well for my skin's usual level of dryness. I've also found it very easy to use too much of this product. I'm used to having to apply large amounts of moisturizer on my face to keep the dryness at bay. However, a little bit of this product goes a long way, and I went through like a third of the tube in only two weeks because I didn't realize I could get away with using less. \n\n**Final Thoughts:** Missha Near Skin Total Ceramide Cream is the first moisturizer that I will happily repurchase (rather than begrudgingly repurchasing Nivea Soft *again* because I can't find anything I actually like). My skin feels happy and moisturized using this product, and I love the way it makes my skin look dewy and fresh. \n\nThis is probably not the right moisturizer for you if your skin is very dehydrated or you're dealing with some exceptional dryness. It's also probably not going to be a good option for people with oily skin, given the dewy finish. However, if you have dry to normal skin and are looking to add some ceramides or a PHA to your routine at a relatively modest price point, then I highly recommend Missha Near Skin Total Ceramide Cream. \n\n**My Rating: 4.5/5**",

As such, this review is based on my experience with the product and may differ (for better or worse) with other experiences or your own experience.  I hope that this honest review of the product will help you to decide whether or not you think this product will work well for yourself.\n\n# Product Itself (Before Trying)\n\n**At a Glance (before opening)**:\n\n* Product size is 11.5 oz. / 326 g.\n* Product states that it is formulated with no parabens, phthalates, mineral oil, or petrolatum.\n* Product states that it is not tested on animals, is cruelty free, is ethically traded/sustainably sourced, comes from a certified corporation, is family founded, and is created with fair trade shea butter.\n   * [What does \"fair trade\" mean?](https://www.greenerchoices.org/fair-trade-certified/)\n* Product states that it is manufactured in the USA using globally-sourced ingredients.\n* Product jar itself is made from 35% recycled plastic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Description on Container**: \"Our Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Whipped Curl Cream provides definition with a soft, flexible hold.  Formulated with Manuka Honey, Yogurt, and Fair Trade Shea Butter, this lightweight curl cream also hydrates and helps strengthen hair to reduce breakage while styling.  Experience significantly less breakage when used as the fifth and last step in the Hydrate + Repair regimen.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Directions For Use on Container**: \"After generously spraying hair with the MANUKA HONEY & YOGURT HYDRATE + REPAIR MULTI-ACTION LEAVE-IN, apply to clean, damp hair and work through.  Style as desired and air dry or diffuse to finish your look.  This is the ultimate finish to the Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair regimen.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients as Listed on Container**: \"Water (Eau), Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin (Vegetable), VP/VA Copolymer, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Olivate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Carbomer, Honey (Miel), Yogurt Extract, Yogurt Powder, Adansonia Digitata (Baobab) Seed Oil, Trichilia Emetica (Mafura) Seed Butter, Inulin (Chicory Root), Sorbitan Olivate, Sodium Hydroxide, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Sodium Phylate, Triethyl Citrate, Caprylyl Glycol, Benzoic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance (Parfum)\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredient Breakdown (with the help of the \"Is it CG?\" Engine):**\n\n1. Product contains two humectants: Glycerin (Vegetable) and Honey (Miel).\n   1. *Humectants absorb moisture and help balance dry and damaged hair, but humectants also pull moisture from the environment too.  It is advised to use humectants with caution if you live in environments are hot and dry.*\n2. Product contains two oils:  Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil and  Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter.\n   1. *Oils are good at coating hair strands in order to seal moisture, but should be used with caution as they may build up over time (especially if you cowash).  It is advised to use a clarifying shampoo occasionally (about ever 2 weeks) to remove buildup that oils may cause.*\n3. Product contains a conditioning agent: Caprylyl Glycol.\n   1. *In this case, this conditioning agent is working as a film-forming ingredient over the hair.  Conditioning agents are water soluble but have potential to build up over time (can clean with clarifying shampoo, see note in oils for more info).*\n4. Product contains a moisturizing alcohol: Cetearyl Alcohol.\n   1. *Alcohols are generally added to hair products to improve their ability to penetrate hair.  This alcohol is considered a moisturizing alcohol, so it will not dry hair.*\n5. Product contains three botanical ingredients: Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Adansonia Digitata (Baobab) Seed Oil, and Trichilia Emetica (Mafura) Seed Butter.\n   1. *Botanical ingredients are ingredients that are derived from plants.  Botanical ingredients generally help with cleansing, stimulating, nourishing, refreshing, soothing, moisturizing, normalizing, and deodorizing.*\n6. Product contains two preservatives: Benzoic Acid and Phenoxyethanol.\n   1. *Preservatives prevent growth of bacteria and micro-organisms in your product.*\n7. Product has fragrance.\n   1. *Fragrance is generally okay to use on hair.  People with scalp sensitivities or allergies to fragrance should avoid fragrance in products.*\n8. Product *may* contain a protein, but this would be a light protein if so: Yogurt Extract and Yogurt Powder.\n   1. *I am honestly not sure if this is a protein, but when looking up online, some sources do say that yogurt contains protein.  If this is a protein, it is likely a very weak form of protein that would not impact your hair too much (honestly, it would still probably be less protein than the Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie, which contains silk protein).*\n\nHere is the full breakdown using the [\"is it CG?\"](http://www.isitcg.com/view/TZFBb9swDIX_CuHDYGMOeu8t8dJ1hyBGUqQY0AttszFRWTRoaYs27L-PyrKiN9N6j_z4-LvwxX1xHAlhJ7yEqAQ79PEN4VE8JfgE3-UcNcBL8ZgGxUDwGQ40Iys8jzzPNEAT1UGjhNNLUdQFW8dnEyqUW4xVDQ0FQk0O1q6XUVwNX13qSdlDeaIzBewcme7U3p3W0MgsLk2kNeydcW2jyoz2Ue4d_6AKHjRygD1bnwP37ONinmmKnhcoG1yCaAVHMrCr5n16thtWDZsYksoyk05xghb1jRnKHEKV34zcmFE7uUL8y6HcMTljvKWxvQTFPrzXrfwcsm09oF_EM8IXPnPAYNgblA67j0hPyv3IzlTbiQL3Jtrha1Sbf-X-D_HNR5dDakbuRRMcRIIxHEU76-0tn9tGRxnYVskXkgsPtmNLPiBpCqNysOifyIBXA6_CqrP13U2bxmyxED1O12xundoxuWttqBSsgIatQU6vwdluaX_yEfMxN-R_Cfew7nmwwSN5uSQzoc-vD4pnRd8TlJb0a5yq4s9f) engine.  I recommend using this engine even if you do not use the CG method because it lets you see what ingredients do what to your hair.  \n\n**Overall Impression Based on These Factors:**\n\nThis is my impression BEFORE trying the product.  Overall, this product sounds like a great replacement for those who are looking for a lightweight, protein-free (at least, from my analysis) curl cream.  I think this product would be a great alternative for those who liked the Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie but didn’t like the protein and weight that the Curl Smoothie had.  This product does have glycerin in it, which I know some hair types are sensitive to, so that could be a turn off for some people.  This product has a lot of moisturizing ingredients in it, so it will probably benefit those seeking moisture for their hair the most.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Information About the Hair this Product is Tested on (My Hair)\n\n**Curl type**: 3A \n\n**Porosity**: Medium-High \n\n**Width**: Fine \n\n**Length**: Somewhere between 12-24 inches \n\n**Density**: lower-normal \n\n**Damage**: I may have a little protein damage on my hair (may have overdid it with a rice wash), but other than that it is mostly healthy.  Last cut was a little over 3 weeks ago.  Last clarify wash was a week ago.  I generally have halo frizz around my scalp area which I am currently combatting with the upside-down shower method.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Other Products Used with this Product and Application Methods Used\n\n**Note**: All products are CG approved.  These are all the products I used on the day I tried this product.  I wash my hair every other day.\n\n**Pre-Treatment**: dampen hair, detangle with a little bit of the Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt conditioner, scrunch out some wetness, apply overnight oil (sweet almond oil, olive oil, rosemary oil, tea tree oil mixture) and sleep with a processing cap on.\n\n**Shampoo**: Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Shampoo\n\n**Conditioner**: Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Conditioner\n\n**Deep Conditioner**: Raw Sugar Healing Power Hair Masque with Avocado Oil + Banana + Coconut Milk + Agave\n\n**Leave-in**: Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Multi-Action Leave-in\n\n**Curl Cream**: Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Whipped Curl Cream (this product)\n\n**Gel**: Kinky Curly Original Curling Custard\n\n**Cast-breaker**: Shea Moisture 100% Argan Oil\n\n**Tools**: WetBrush Wet Brush, Microfiber head wraps (I use them as towels to scrunch), Xtava Black Orchid Diffuser, InfinityPro by Con Air Drier, my hands (for scrunching)\n\n**Method**: Wet hair while leaning forward (back of head facing ceiling and hair pointing down).  Shampoo roots while leaving forward and use praying hands to run shampoo over the rest of the hair.  Rinse leaning forward.  Apply conditioner leaning forward and use a wet brush to distribute in product, squish to condish while leaning forward.  Let sit for 2-4 minutes.  Rinse while leaning forward.  Apply deep conditioner while leaning forward and use a wet brush to distribute product.  Let sit for 8-15 minutes.  Squish to condish and leave a little in hair when finishing.  While leaning forward, apply leave-in and curl cream by using praying hands and then scrunching upwards.  Scrunch some of the moisture out of hair with a microfiber cloth, then praying hands + scrunch in gel.  Diffuse with Xtava’s Black Orchid diffuser on low heat low (\"cool\") speed, let hair sit for a couple minutes and scrunch out the cast with Shea Moisture’s 100% Pure Argan Oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# First Impressions After Opening Product\n\nThe smell of the product is quite nice and very low-key.  It smells like the rest of this line if you have ever tried it.  The consistency is almost like lotion (if you have ever used Cerave Daily Moisturizing Lotion, think of that texture/look/consistency).  On a side note, the safety seal was INSANE to take off, so you’ll *definitely* know if someone tampered with your product.  When compared to the curl smoothie, the curl smoothie is a lot more “coagulated” (idk how else really to describe it) versus this product, so this whipped curl cream definitely gives the appearance of being lighter than the curl smoothie.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Thoughts During Application\n\nI applied this product while upside down (leaning forward so that the back of my head faced the ceiling and my hair pointed downward) and with near soaking wet hair by running a small amount on my hands down the top of my head first (not raking in).  After that, I applied a little more to my hands and used prayer hands to apply it down the length of my hair.  Something interesting I noticed while doing this was that the cream seemed to soak in immediately, like, in literal seconds.  At first I thought I wasn't using enough product, but as I continued using prayer hands around my hair I noticed that the product melted in all around my head.  When I scrunched after using praying hands, I noticed that the curls seemed quite defined (I had a little wet frizz, but this is nothing out of the ordinary for me).  The smell was very pleasant and didn't bother me at all during the application.  Something else I noticed was that this product didn't provide the same \"slip,\" or slippery feeling, that the curl smoothie did.  This may be because it wasn't as heavy as the curl smoothie, but it did leave my hair with its normal, slightly rougher texture that I normally feel (it felt like how wet hair feels without any product added).  I kind of actually liked this, since to me that was proof that it wasn't going to weigh my hair down and didn't create a film over the hair that brought it down, but I could still tell it was working because of how well my hair was holding a curl while wet.  Overall, I probably used a little over a quarter's worth (maybe a half-dollar coin's worth) of product, which for me is more than I'd use for the curl smoothie but less than I thought I'd have to use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Results\n\n**Before Scrunching:** As I am sitting here letting my hair settle after diffusing, I am looking at my hair and noticing the amount of volume it has now before breaking the cast that I do not normally get.\n\n**After Scrunching:** Holy volume Batman!  So after scrunching, I noticed that my curls definitely look softer than they normally do with the curl smoothie.  I'm not sure if that is a good thing or bad thing at the moment, so I'll have to see how my hair holds up for the rest of the day.  The cast I had wasn't entirely crunchy, so I may not have diffused for long enough which could also be the culprit, but unknown.  My hair smells sooooo good but is not overwhelming, which is nice.  My hair also feels a lot softer after having scrunched, so it looks like the cream doesn't turn your hair super rough.  [Here is what my hair looked like after I scrunched it (not my closet, sorry for the clutter in the background).](https://imgur.com/a/T08BGx3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Final Verdict\n\n**Disclaimer**: I am only one person, and this is only one product review.  As such, this review is based on my experience with the product and may differ (for better or worse) with other experiences or your own experience.  I hope that this honest review of the product will help you to decide whether or not you think this product will work well for yourself.\n\nMaybe it is still too soon to tell, but I really, *really* like this cream after this first wash.  It didn't make my finer hair feel weighed down after a shower, and I didn't have to be super careful to not overdo it during application like I normally have to do for the curl smoothie.  My hair feels softer and less \"wet\" than it normally does after I scrunch the crunch, which may be due to my gel or this curl cream, but either way I'm liking it.  Now that my hair is crunched, it feels extremely bouncy (like, I'm bouncing in the mirror just to see how it bounces) and lightweight.  I don't know how it will hold up in the elements, since I haven't gone outside, but for now it looks great.\n\nConsidering the price for the amount of product, it seems like a pretty good deal.  The Whipped Curl Cream's container is 11.5 oz (interestingly enough, the curl smoothie is 12 oz, so it looks like someone at Shea Moisture wanted to be funny).  I bought the tub for $12, so it looks like that is nearly a dollar per ounce, which I consider to be good for the price.  I didn't have to use a ton of product to get the result I did, so I anticipate this tub lasting me at least 6 months if not longer.  \n\nThe smell and consistency were great in my opinion.  The product didn't feel \"goopy\" like the curl smoothie and essentially melted into my hair, which I was totally not expecting.  This is probably due to the \"whipped\" nature of the product, as products marketed as \"whipped\" tend to be lighter and absorbed easily.  The smell was not overpowering, and I actually kind of preferred it over the curl smoothie to be honest (after a while, the curl smoothie begins to smell like over scented baby-powder/diapers to me).\n\nOverall, I think this product is *definitely* worth checking out if you are looking for a lightweight curl cream, have used the Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie but feel weighed down by it, or are looking for a curl cream for finer hair.  The price is good, the product looks good, and I am very happy with the results.  \n\nI hope this review may have helped some of you curlies out there!  Good luck on your curl journey :)\n\n# After a Week Update\n\nGood morning y’all!  So it’s been a week since I bought this product and I’ve had some time to see how it performs with my hair.  I’ll start by saying I think that it’s done well for my hair in that it is so lightweight, but sometimes I still find it hard to style my hair without that “coating” the curl smoothie gave me.  I have noticed that I’ve had a bit more wet frizz than normal, which I had a really bad buildup episode so it could be that or this cream, but I’m really not sure.  I’ve still also noticed that my hair seems to become a bit more frizzy when I scrunch the crunch, but I have a funny feeling that that’s due to the new gel I tried and not this cream, but it could be.  Here is a pros and cons list of what I’ve noticed over the past couple days:\n\n**Pros:**\n1. Product is very light weight and clearly does not weigh down my hair.\n2. Product forms wet curls well when scrunched in (but may need a strong-hold gel after to keep them).\n3. Product smells great (I prefer it way more than the curl smoothie).\n4. Price point for product is very affordable.\n\n**Cons:**\n1. Product may not be able to support certain curl types without more hold (I have 3a hair, may work better for wavier hair but this could also be a gel problem).\n2. You will need to use more product than expected to get results.\n3. Product may contribute to wet frizz (my hair had a ton of buildup so this may have contributed too)\n4. This is not a curl cream that you can probably add in and then walk out for the day, it will most likely require a gel to help the hold.\n\nOverall, I’d rate it 7.5/10.  It’s worked really well for my hair, and this rating could go up when I try swapping my strong-hold gel back into my routine and see if it was the cream or the gel that isn’t holding my hair.  The product makes my hair so soft once my routine is done and doesn’t weigh my finer width hair down, but I do have to use more product than I normally did with the SM CS.  I’m definitely going to use up the rest of this jar, and I still highly recommend this to people who are looking for a lightweight curl cream to try.  Unfortunately, there is no sample size containers out there and I did email Shea Moisture asking about samples, but they essentially told me to take a hike so that was a no.  Regardless, if you are able to get your hands on this product, I think it is definitely worth a try!",

        "body": "Thank you so much for your extremely thorough original post, and for the update. Your hair looks great!\n\nI have somewhat similar hair, have been experimenting with products for a while, and have yet to find any holy grail products. Reviews like this help a lot!\n\nI used to have such a simple hair routine, several years ago. I’d occasionally shampoo with T-Gel for scalp issues, but would normally cowash with a conditioner (not CG) and use a little of the same stuff as a leave in, then scrunch with a T-shirt and air dry. Depending on how badly I needed a haircut, I wouldn’t need any styling product until refreshing, and my hair would have good clumpy ringlets up front and a good wave in the back on my short-ish style. But then my perfect conditioner was discontinued. My hair has never looked as good with so little effort since. \n\nIt’s improved a lot since this round with CG, mostly due to this sub. My curls can get curlier and the waves in the back are sometimes curls, but my hair seems really sensitive to both protein and humidity. I’m in the Pacific Northwest, so we can get a lot of humidity! I’m also sensitive or allergic to a ton of scents used in hair products, so that limits what I can try. \n\nSorry to rant all over your wonderful product review. You’ve actually helped with some of my curly hair frustrations because I think I’m going to try this curl cream.",

Easy to spread texture for a natural, hydrated, shine-free finish leaving no white cast.\n\n*Fragrance free • Non-comedogenic • 50ml*  \nPrice- $499  \n \n\n**Ingredients**\n\n**Uvinul A Plus**\n\nThis Modern filter excels in protecting your skin from free radical and skin damage. Its Photostable nature provides continuous defence against the sun, while its excellent safety profile makes it perfect for all skin types, including the most sensitive. In the formula it not only promises potent UVA protection but also enhances the formula for broad-spectrum protection.\n\n**Tinosorb M**\n\nTinosorb M is an UV filter that revolutionises sun protection with its broad-spectrum coverage against both UVA and UVB rays, also provides even protection into visible (blue) light, Its dual-action mechanism not only absorbs but also scatters sunlight, offering unparalleled defence against the sun's harmful effects. Renowned for its photostability, it ensures long-lasting protection, maintaining its efficacy even under direct sunlight.\n\n**Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate**\n\nIt stands out as a UVB filter that effectively shields your skin from the sun rays. It's popular for its ability to prevent sunburn and protect against UV-induced damage. This UV filter is prized for its lightweight feel making daily application enjoyable without the greasiness.\n\nWater/Aqua, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Dimethicone, Ethoxydiglycol, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Diisopropyl Adipate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Isododecane, Pentylene Glycol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Acrylates/Polytrimethylsiloxymethacrylate Copolymer, Decyl Glucoside, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Propylene Glycol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Xanthan Gum  \n\n\n**Review**  \nSkin Type: Combination (Oily in T-zone), acne-prone, currently a bit dry due to acne medication  \nWeather: Pleasant, not hot enough to test sweat resistance  \nAge 25-30  \nTexture: Super watery in texture, close to the new Neutrogena Dry-Touch sunscreen.  \nApplication: for my skin, it blended easily, like a dream.  \nWhite Cast: My face is slightly darker than NC42 and most sunscreens leave a white cast including Minimalist SPF50. This left no white cast at all, I was pleasantly surprised.  \nWent out in the sun for an hour, no stinging/burning/tanning observed but that is too soon to judge.\n\nOverall: After application, it forms a slightly tight film which gives a glow to the face. I had slight barrier damage on my chin, it did not sting when I applied the sunscreen there but pilled after a while only in that area. I usually get sweaty on my nose post sunscreen application but that did not happen, it might be due to the pleasant weather. My skin feels slightly stretchy right now and lightly oily on my forehead  \nAM Routine today: Simple Moisturizing face wash-->.Cosrx propolis synergy toner-->Cosrx Vitamin C 23%-->Simple hydrating light moisturizer-->wait 5 minutes then sunscreen\n\n  \n**TL;DR**: I think I will repurchase this, it has great lab and human testing results, the texture and application seems great for summers for my skin and this is the first sunscreen which truly has no white cast for me. The last sunscreen to do this was Aqualogica which tanned me. (I don't mind tanning but it proved that it did not protect my skin). \n\nObviously YMMV but I hope this works for you. Feel free to ask any questions.",

The expectation seems to be that it's supposedly very good for acne prone skin. There are pictures of someone with pretty bad acne showing before and after pictures of their acne going away. (Korean skin care is more geared toward CALMING & SOOTHING acne than to go to war with it with drying treatments and whatnot. I guess because a large component of acne is inflammation?)* \n\n*Some people said it doesn't seem to do anything for them, sensitive types seems to like it a lot, that it absorbs quickly. They like that it's unfragranced. Some VERY oily types said they feel like their skin is a little bit more oilier when they use it and that it doesn't absorb well for them. It may be really popular due to Director Pi suggesting it as the #1 soothing ampoule in her recent video.

I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!\n\nIngredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm really excited about this section. I'm not happy that Korea is and has been for years, swamped in pollution from the winds carrying it over. There is a lot of microdust and even people with resilient skin reported getting redness & severe irritation from the pollution. Everyone has to wear these giant masks, sometimes special ones, and limit their exposure to the world outside of their homes.*\n\n*So there has been a lot of push for soothing, calming products and \"clean\" ingredients. A lot more focus on repairing the skin barrier. So I'm excited about those, but not the fact that people have to suffer.*\n\n*I'll be bolding some of the soothing, repairing and/or skin-identical ingredients in the ingredient lists. I don't know every good ingredient, but I will bold the ones that I do know of. Some other beneficial ingredients as well.*\n\n*\\*Also got random pictures of the textures of the creams and the users who posted it.*\n\n*If you're interested in barrier repairing/replenishing as I am, here are some good quotes from Susan, from Swift Crafty Monkey blog:*\n\n>**Natural moisturizing factor (NMF)** is found within the corneocytes, and makes up 20% to 30% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum. It **consists of amino acids (40%), sodium PCA (12%), lactate (12%), urea (7%), ions (18.5%), sugars (like glycerol – 8.5%)**, and a few other things. These are water soluble [humectants](https://swiftcraftymonkey.blog/better-crafting-through-chemistry/) (meaning they draw water out of the atmosphere to our skin) that have a huge impact on the biochemical and mechanical properties of our skin. Having an adequate NMF level in our skin can prevent or reduce skin tightness, cracking, scaling, and flaking. It improves our skin’s plasticity (thanks to the interactions of the amino acids with keratin) and helps maintain skin’s barrier properties.  \n>  \n>**Filaggrin** is a really important protein found in our skin! ...When we are in more arid climates, the filaggrin breakdown increases to produce more NMF. More NMF is a good thing!  \n>  \n>The contents of the NMF do more than act as humectants. The lactate and potassium can affect the pH and stiffness of the stratum corneum. The lactic acid stimulates ceramide biosynthesis and improves barrier function. The [hyaluronic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan) (HA – picture to the left) maintains hydration and structural integrity of our skin. It also interacts with intercellular lipids and regulates the mechanical properties of the stratum corneum.  \n>  \n>\\[The strateum corneum lipids\\] make up about 15% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum, and contain about **40% to 50% ceramides, 20% to 25% cholesterol, 15% to 25% fatty acids** (those with C16 to C30 chain lengths, with C24 to C28 being the most common), and **5% to 10% cholesterol sulfate**.  \n>  \n>Oils with **linoleic or gamma-linoleic acid** are always welcomed by our skin (like sunflower, sesame seed, borage, evening primrose, rice bran, and others), especially in the winter.\n\n**Squalane, beeswax, lecithin, lanolin** are also good skin replenishing ingredients. Shea butter is very soothing and moisturizing, as well as having a lot of antioxidants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TOP CREAMS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. \\[Dr. G\\] Red Blemish Clear Soothing Cream - 4.22/5 (9,894 Reviews)**\n\n70ml/36,000 KRW - $31.29\n\nWater (Aqua/Eau), **Glycerin**, Butylene Glycol, C 13-16 Isoparaffin, **Niacinamide**, C 12-14 Isoparaffin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Pentylene Glycol, Vinyl Dimethicone, Caprylyl Methicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Panthenol**, Acrylates/C 10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Tromethamine, **Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate,** Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, **Beta-Glucan, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside,** Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Epigallocatechin Gallate, **Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid.**\n\n*This line from this brand is extremely well-known and popular in Korea.

The texture is slightly thick and gooey(but not gross)\n\nApplication: I use 3-4 pumps for my whole face. I apply it on wet dripping face right after cleanser in the evening. On some days I layer it twice. My skin drinks it up as soon as I apply it. It spreads easily on wet skin. On dry skin it doesn't fully absorb and sits on the skin.\n\nI love it. I bought 9 bottles so far. And gifted three to my friends. You can see 4 in the photo. I gave away the old ones for recycling. I use it every day in my PM routine during winters. It helps keep my skin hydrated in dry weather. If i go a week without using it, I can feel the difference. Skin feels tight and not as glowy when i wake up. I always take it for travelling. It's helpful during flights and while staying in hotel rooms where my skin feels most dehydrated.\n\n***10/10 Will repurchase , Holy Grail!***\n\nSorry for any mistakes. This is my first review. English is hard. Please be nice.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the product, do ask.\n\nIngredient list:  Snail Secretion Filtrate, Betaine, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Ethyl Hexanediol, Carbomer, Panthenol, Arginine\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kji0qunq126c1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ce0d4f723574305d1432788265475e90018dca3",

Any pimples or problems disappear for me in humid climates, but I think I still have to moisturize my face at least at night. So I'm struggling to find something non-greasy (yes, many products on my semi-dry skin are greasy and pill and I hate it).",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

I hate it when something works really well for me and they go reformulate the whole thing. The money spent is no joke either.\n\nI realized too late and already applied it on my whole face without patch testing first so... we'll see how it goes\n\nSo far though...\nConsistency wise, new formula is a bit more watery compared sa old na very thick. \n - New feels a little lighter and less greasy vs. Old thats heavier to the point that u can feel it on you even on the back of my hand.\n - Maybe it could be a good thing with the PH weather. Cant say if the new one is less moisturizing yet but comparing them on my hands, Old formula is more slippery/greasy, new one feels a little matte thats slightly greasy if that makes sense?\n\nScent wise, theres a subtle difference but new one is still unscented.\n\nI'll update in maybe a week and see how it goes.

I used it side by side one day and the side with the new formula didn’t feel as heavy and the finger swipe wasn’t as greasy.\n* I’m not sure if its viable as a morning moisturizer now, but I did use it as such under my Omi Sunbears Sunscreen. \n   * I avoided using this sunscreen when I damaged my skin barrier as it dried so matte it made my skin so dry and my old moisturizers *(Hyaloo and Klued)* weren’t enough for it.

    "body": "&#x200B;\n\n[My '21 backup bottle, vs the '23 reformulation.](https://preview.redd.it/unnmv3fwwgrc1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb82e855546e146bfd1cc9e5ecc28a23682a82d3)\n\nThis is technically going to be a first impressions because I haven’t been using this for long, but. I’ll be as detailed and unbiased as I can. The previous ’21 formulation was HG for my ***combo-oily, acne-prone, chronically dehydrated, reactive, sensitive skin***. I also have a strong suspicion I have mild rosacea, but no diagnosis because I’m in (southeast) Canada. The climate here is “humid-continental” with moderately hot, fairly humid summers and moderately cold winters, similar to New York.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Here’s the skincare routine I’ve been using for the last year:**\n\n* KLAIRS Gentle Black Fresh Cleansing Oil — PM, occasionally, as needed.\n* ISNTREE Green Tea Fresh Cleanser — AM/PM, daily.\n* PAULA’S CHOICE Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant (NON-AB) — PM, \\~2x weekly.\n* COSRX Full Fit Propolis Synergy Toner — AM/PM, daily. \n* COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence — AM/PM, daily.\n* ETUDE HOUSE SoonJung 10-Free High Moist Emulsion — AM/PM, daily.\n* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water Fit Sun Serum — AM, daily.\n* BY WISHTREND Vitamin A-mazing Bakuchiol Night Cream — PM \\~3x weekly (recent addition).\n* ILLIYOON Ceramide ATO Concentrate Cream — PM, most nights.\n* EUCERIN Aquaphor Healing Ointment (NON-AB) — PM, as needed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I’ll start out with my review of the ‘21 original, then share my impressions of what’s changed in the ’23 reformulation.**\n\nThe ‘21 OG: *Extremely versatile and soothing: an unscented, ultra lightweight gel cream style lotion with a slightly nutty, grassy scent. This is an odd product in that it’s quite emollient for how light it is, and it took me a while to get used to the dewy finish after using only matte American moisturizers for many years, but it soon became HG for my combo-oily sensitive skin. Drydown takes a few minutes and leaves a faintly glowy (but not shiny) finish. It doesn’t break me out or irritate my skin in any way, and though it doesn’t provide my combination skin with enough moisture overall, it works great layered over a toner + essence and under sunscreen in the AM, or under a thicker, more occlusive moisturizer at night. I love the pump bottle, the price, and how easily it layers: both with itself and with other products. I typically use 3-4 pumps in a single layer and I’ll often use 2 layers.* \n\nSo, what’s changed?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE FORMULA:** \n\nThey removed ***Stearic Acid*** (an emollient fatty acid) and added: \n\n* ***1,2-Hexanediol*** \\- a humectant / emollient solvent that can boost the antimicrobial action of preservatives.\n* ***Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer*** \\- a hydrophobic polymer similar to Carbomer, often used as a thickening agent and emulsion stabilizer. \n* ***Tromethamine*** \\- an alkaline buffering agent.\n\n([I posted a PSA on the reformulation a while back with full inci lists for both.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/17aqkq5/psa_etude_house_soonjung_10free_moist_emulsion/))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE PACKAGING:**\n\nI love the new aesthetic! The bubbly gen-Zish font is cute and clean; it looks soothing and matches their makeup. The designer did a fantastic job on the text, but IMO *overall, the redesign is a failure*. Because everything aside from the 6.5 Whip Cleanser and 5.5 Toner come in identical tube packaging, everything looks exactly the same. That makes it hard to shop for these products, not to mention it’d get dodgy if you were using multiple products from the SoonJung range. As far as the container itself goes: it isn’t a bad vessel for the consistency of the formula, but I vastly prefer the convenience of the original pump bottle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE SCENT:**\n\nBoth are unscented, but the ‘21 had such a beautiful, soothing scent: like if I made a matcha latte with extra almond milk, garnished it with three strands of fresh cut grass, and put it at the other end of the room. Extremely subtle, but it made me look forward to using it. — The ‘23 just smells like any unscented product: inoffensive, but slightly plasticky. If I’m being honest, this is the aspect of the reformulation I’m the most bummed about. As someone who can only use unscented skincare, I take my kicks where I can get ‘em.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PRODUCT CONSISTENCY:**\n\nIf you look *really* closely, the ‘23 is slightly more opaque and thicker, but they otherwise look extremely similar. (I tried to take a photo to illustrate the difference, but they literally looked the same, so I scrapped my weird hand pic.) The ‘21 spreads like a regular, lightweight gel cream, whereas the ‘23 has a “waterburst” effect. While the ‘23 feels lighter upon application, it sort of smears around before sinking in, unlike the ’21, which begins soaking in immediately. That said, the ‘21 takes twice as long to dry down: about 15-20 minutes after toner & essence applied to wet skin (10 min max for the ’23), and 5-10 minutes applied to dry skin / as a second layer (5 min max for the ’23). Neither application experience is unpleasant in any way, and neither particularly thrill me, but they are different. Both layer well with themselves and with other products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FINISH:**\n\n* SURFACE FEEL: The ’21 is a little dewier and more emollient. The ’23 feels lighter / a little less oily. That said, it does have a very slight film to it (similar to the ‘21 SoonJung Hydro Barrier Cream) which makes the finish feel a bit less *natural*.\n* SKIN FEEL: Though I actually find the ’23 more cosmetically elegant, it doesn’t feel as “nourishing” to my skin.\n* APPEARANCE: Once dried, both have a nearly identical finish: slightly glowy, but not shiny — though if I’m being extremely scrupulous, the ’21 has a touch more sheen. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FINAL THOUGHTS:**\n\nI think that folks who found the ’21 Emulsion too oily will like this. Also, if you liked the finish of the ’21 Hydro Barrier Cream, but found it too heavy, you will like this. If you found the ’21 Emulsion too light, you will not like this. Overall, it feels a little lighter and I think it’ll be a decent summer moisturizer for oily and combo-oily people.\n\nI’m getting dryer as the years go by, and I still prefer the original. Though the reformulation doesn’t trigger any sensitivities, and it hasn’t broken me out (yet), it feels like some of the magic is gone… It’s not quite as soothing, and the change of scent makes the user experience less enjoyable (though people less sensitive to scent might not notice). That said, my feelings on this reformulation might change once I wear it through the summer. If so, I’ll post an update.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** Even though I personally find this lighter reformulation slightly worse for my skin, it’s by no means ruined, and might even be an improvement for folks with oilier skin. I still think it’s a solid moisturizer at a decent price point, best suited to people with oily sensitive skin. It’s definitely different, but overall I’d still recommend it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHave you tried both? If so, what are your feelings on this reformulation?\n\n**UPDATE:** This broke me out in CCs after a few weeks of continued use and made my skin feel more irritable. Obviously, not everyone will have the same experience, but if you’re sensitive I’d approach with caution. RIP Etude Emulsion. 🪦 ",

I still have two bottles of the old emulsion stockpiled, but I was debating whether to get the reformulation or try out a completely different product instead. I think I may try out some new products, but it sounds like I should give the new reformation a shot too!",

But I wasn't much of a fan of the slight tackiness when it dried down. It sounds like the reformulation may suit my skin better!

Was hoping this would help the sensitivity not make it worse... I'm not 100% ready to ditch it, but I'm going to give it a break and see if it clears up. Then might give it a try one more time to be sure. Side note,  I work in surgery and wear masks all day. Also, I travel for work to different hospitals in the US. I am in a completely different climate than what I am used to right now, and the hospital I'm currently on assignment with only has 2 options for masks. So, it could be either of those things contributing to the problem as well. I really liked the way it felt when I first started using it, so I hope I can try it again after a break and have good results. I fully agree about the packaging.

Apart from some Neutrogena products and No7 Beautiful Skin Blemish Defence Serum, they contain \"alcohol denat.\", which is a dealbreaker for me as I try to avoid drying alcohols as much as I can. \n\nBHAs are few and very far in between, in addition to not being labelled as such and most probably without the percentage of salicylic acid contained or whether it's in the right pH to be effective. \n\nI haven't done a price comparison, and since I found them in Boots I've used the online site's price point. Prices are only as a guide, they may be cheaper/more expensive elsewhere. Ingredients are highlighted to point out the position of salicylic acid, as well as presence of drying alcohols and parfum for those irritated by them. \n\nAdditional suggestions, opinions and reviews are very welcome!\n\n* PRODUCT: Boots Skin Clear Deep Blackhead Cleansing Lotion\n\nPRICE: £2.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua (Water), **Alcohol denat.**, **Salicylic acid**, PPG-1-PEG-9 lauryl glycol ether, Butylene glycol, Potassium hydroxide, Ammonium glycyrrhizate, **Parfum (Fragrance)**, Dipropylene glycol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Deep Cleansing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.29 for 65 exfoliating pads\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat., Salicylic Acid,** Isoceteth-20, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Hydroxide, Triethanolamine, Allantoin, **Parfum**, **Menthol**, Benzyl Salicylate, Disodium EDTA, Limonene, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Pads\n\nPRICE: 5.39 for 65 pads\n\nINGREDIENTS:Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, **Salicylic Acid**, Hydrogen Peroxide, **Parfum**, Sodium Hydroxide, Dextrin, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Superfruits Refreshing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.07\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, Glycerin, **Salicylic Acid**, **Parfum**, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Sodium Hydroxide, Propylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Limonene, Citronellol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Hexyl Cinnamal, Rubus Idaeus Juice, Trideceth-9, Vaccinium Macrocarpon Fruit Juice, Geraniol, Bisabolol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Garnier Pure Active line (various)\n\nPRICE: from £4.99 to £7.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: I can't find an ingredients list anywhere, which is frustrating but as a guide, I remember putting all the Garnier products down because they contain \"Alcohol Denat.\" The packaging lists 2% salicylic acid.

I'm not sure if it's due to the age of the bottle, or just the ingredients, but I discontinued use.\n\nThen I bought *Boots Skin Clear Deep Cleansing Lotion* which is exactly the same as the Blackhead version just with an extra word on the front.

Reviewing FormulaRX Barrier Relief Moisturiser\n \n* Texture and consistency:  It sinks right in the skin and has a gel like texture. It doesn’t feel heavy nor makes me sweat on application unlike other moisturisers make me do. I loved the fact it’s so lightweight and has the gel consistency.\n\n* Effect/ Result: to be very honest, when I first started using this moisturiser, I felt like it was breaking me out, at one point I even stopped using the moisturiser for a while because I was just upset. I loved the texture so much but had been doubting if it’s breaking me out. But later I realised it wasn’t the moisturiser, it was just my usual hormonal acne. I’ve been using it for 2 months and lately it has been working just fine. \n\n• It has 4% niacinamide, confirmed with brand. I had thought of using it as an alternative to a niacinamide serum, but didn’t show any added visible effects.\n\n* Would not repurchase because: \n1. The price, 699 for a 50 g basic moisturiser?!?!\n2. It does it’s job, moisturises my face. Nothing exceptional about it and honestly the Minimalist moisturiser does the same thing for a lesser price.\n3. It makes my face extremely oily and greasy in an hour. My face looks extremely dull. I wouldn’t use it in day time.\n\n•PROS.\nThe thing I love the most about this moisturiser is its consistency and lightweight feature but then the fact it makes my face oily AF is a bummer :(\n\nCute packaging: I’m a sucker for pastel colours and aesthetics and gohd I love the tube in my skincare cabinet, looks so pretty ✨\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS \nLike I’ve been mentioning again and again, I really wanted to love this moisturiser but the price point and lack of any exceptional feature wouldn’t make me purchase it again. \n\nMinimalist Sepicalm 3% + Oat Moisturizer\n\nReview Type: RAVE\n\nPrice: Rs. 345-349 for 50 g\n\nUsage Time: 4 Months, every night and sometimes day too\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Squalane, Glycerine, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Sodium Cocoyl Aminoacids, Sarcosine, Potassium Aspartate, Magnesium Aspartate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Avena Sativa (Oat Kernel) Flour, Sodium Polyglutamate, Undecane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Tocopherol Acetate, Arginine, Glycine, Alanine, Histidine, Sodium Lactate, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Tridecane, Aluminium Starch Octenylsuccinate, Trehalose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n* It has a creamy texture and is quite a thick moisturiser for an extremely oily skin person like me.\n\n* It does not have any actives and I can layer it on top on any active I use, is the fact I love this moisturiser.\n\n* It is decently priced, would definitely repurchase it. \n\n* I’ve used it under makeup and it has worked wonders since the makeup didn’t cause any breakout or any dryness or flakiness.\n\n* I’ve been using it since July, taking a pea sized amount every-night and still have almost 3/5 left, a little goes a long way for me which makes it super affordable. \n\n* I think it’s safe for me to call it my HG moisturiser. It has never broken me out or caused any CCs or any another issue.\n* Literally soothed me, I had been using pulp vit C earlier which was quite strong and potent, Sepicalm moisturiser came handy every time\n\nCONS\n* it’s thick and greasy\n\n* Does not sink in skin immediately unlike the FormulaRX one. It sits on skin for a while\n\n* Makes me sweat after application \n\n* Cannot use it in day (except under makeup)\n\nWhy do I still use it\n- No matter what texture it has, it has soothed my acne, vit C burn, and improved overall skin texture.\n\n- I love the price point \n\n- I use it at night so I don’t worry about how I look, all I care is how well it works. And it does work for me!\n\nI know we’ve missed detailed reviews on this sub here so here’s one from me, more coming in!\nHope y’all find it helpful :)",

It’s an apples to oranges comparison. One is a ceramide moisturiser which has 3 ceramides + phytosphingosine + niacinamide. This usually comes in very expensive creams.\n\nMinimalist on the other hand is the basic moisturiser\n\nIt’s a difference in needs and wants regarding which one would be preferred by a user.",

Not the $8 Korean retail price, but still, it seems really worth it to me considering the amazing ingredients.\n\nPanthenol is especially really underrated but it seriously kicks ass for dry & sensitive skin/tret face like mine (make sure it's at least 5% tho to be most effective). I love the Aveeno Eczema Therapy Cream bc it's so moisturizing & healing, but it PILLS LIKE CRAZY. Grrrrrrr. And it's a litttle sticky. Otherwise, it would be perfect.\n\n(Also, if you have super tret face/super dry skin, urea is very much worth looking into. It's super underrated as well. It's probably one of the most scientifically proven to be effective dry skin ingredients, but it's not marketed in the US for whatever reason. Maybe bc people think it's from \"urine\"? That's obviously not where they get it in skin care products lol, which is why education is so important. \n\nThe Eucerin 5% Urea face cream is the most accessible one I have found, but there's also Balea? Sebamed, Numis, Medisei Panthenol Extra (also 5% panthenol, but may be clogging) from Greece, Bioturm - all 5% urea creams, for those outside the US. I don't suggest going above 5%, as it can be exfoliating and I personally have those to be really heavy/greasy.",

    "body": "**TL;DR: Don't fuck up like me. Make sure your moisturizer, primer, and foundation all have the same base or you will regret it.** \n\nOk, I know that this topic has come up a lot recently, but I feel like a lot of discussions leave out a key part of the problem. By now, I think most people know that you have to make sure your primer and foundation have the same base i.e. are they water based or silicone based. It makes sense since those two are layered one on top of the other and if they're immiscible then the foundation will just settle on top and come off on everything, defeating the purpose of a primer. Now, what I haven't seen discussed is how your moisturizer may be interacting with your primer and foundation. I've discovered some interesting things through trial and error recently and wanted to share it with the MUA community.\n\nFirst, I recently switched moisturizers. My skin has been a disaster this winter and I needed a major skincare overhaul. I have sensitive skin and Neutrogena has always had my back with great products that don't irritate my skin. One of the new things I got was a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, the [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/hydro+boost+water+gel.do?sortby=ourPicks). I love this product because it absorbs quickly, eliminated my dry spots, and hasn't caused any irritation. What I didn't take into account when I bought this product was the ingredients list; I was just happy to find a non-irritating hyaluronic acid delivery system. \n\nwater, **dimethicone**, glycerin, **dimeticone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer**, phenoxyethanol, polyacrylamide, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, dimethiconol, C13-14 isoparaffin, **dimethicone crosspolymer**, chlorphenesin, carbomer, laureth-7, sodium hyaluronate, ethylhexylglycerin, fragrance, C12-14 pareth-12, sodium hydroxide, blue 1 \n\nThe bolded ingredients indicate it's a silicone-based primer. Yes, the first ingredient is water, but the silicone is present in large amounts, and it interacts differently with water-based products.\n\nMistake 1: I was going for a low-effort look one day and decided to used some of my face powder and call it good. With face powder I usually wear my [NYX HD Primer](http://www.nyxcosmetics.com/high-definition-primer/NYX_180.html) because it's lighter but still holds the powder in place. That day my makeup was slipping and sliding everywhere and I looked like a cakey hot mess when I got home. I checked the ingredients on my moisturizer, found all the silicone, then looked at the primer ingredients. \n\n**Water/Aqua/Eau,** Propylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Diethylhexyl Maleate, Glycerin, Ethylene/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Dimethicone, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, PEG-15 Glyceryl Isostearate, Trihydroxystearin, Adipic Acid/Neopentyl Glycol Crosspolymer, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Tocopheryl Acetate, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax/Cera Carnauba/Cire de Carnauba, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7, Silica, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin,  Propylene Glycol Stearate, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Laurate, Propylene Glycol Laurate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Butylene Glycol, Salicornia Herbacea Extract, Copper Tripeptide-1,  Chlorphenesin, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, VP/VA Copolymer, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, C12-14 Pareth-7, Amodimethicone,  Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance/Parfum, Citronellol, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. MAY CONTAIN / PEUT CONTENIR (+/-): Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Zinc Oxide (CI 77947), Chromium Hydroxide Green (CI 77289), Ultramarines (CI 77007).\n\nThe water-based primer just sat on top of my moisturizer, making my makeup come off all over everything.\n\nMistake 2: I somehow spaced and forgot all about my moisturizer issues and yesterday I was rushing to leave and decided to just throw on some Sonia Kashuk Radiant Tinted Moisturizer and go. Wrong move. I had already washed my face and moisturized previously, so the Neutrogena moisturizers was under the tinted moisturizer. As I was rubbing the tinted moisturizer on my face, it started to ball up and look disgusting. I quickly wiped it off and left bare faced, but later I looked at the ingredients in the Sonia Kashuk Tinted Moisturizer. \n\nFluorphlogopite, Sorbitan Is Os Tearate,\nTris Iloxane, D Is Teardimonium Hectorite,\nCetyl Peg/Ppg‐10/1 D Imethicone,\nD Imethicone Cros S Polymer, Butylene Glycol,\nSilica D Imethyl Silylate, Synthetic Bees Wax,\nTetras Odium Ed Ta, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium\nChloride, Alcohol, Talc, Peg‐30\nD Ipolyhydroxys Tearate, Aluminum\nHydroxide, Potas S Ium Sorbate, Stearic Acid,\nCaprylyl Methicone, As Corbyl Palmitate,\nTocopherol, Pentaerythrityl Tetra‐Di‐T‐Butyl\nHydroxyhydrocinnamate.\nMay Contain: Mica, Titanium D Ioxide, Iron\nOxides , Zinc Oxide.\n\nThis one is a little more tricky, as it does have some dimethicone ingredients, but my best guess is that the other ingredients react negatively with the ingredients in the Neutrogena moisturizer.\n \nNow, I know this sounds like using the Neutrogena moisturizer is too much of a pain, but it's really not that big of a deal. My favorite primer, the [ELF Poreless Face Primer](http://www.elfcosmetics.com/p/poreless-face-primer?dept=face-faceprimer), works perfectly with this moisturizer and my HG foundation, [Revlon Colorstay Whipped](http://www.revlon.com/products/face/foundation-makeup/revlon-colorstay-whipped-creme-makeup#309971347054||0), goes on better than ever. I just wanted to make this post to inform people that mismatched moisturizer can cause just as many issues as mismatched primer and foundation!",

The About Me Be Clean seems to be alcohol and fragrance-free (non sure if rosemary leaf oil is an essential oil and fragrant??). I would probably go with the Innifree though because I prefer alcohol in my sunscreen, otherwise they are too too dewy and greasy looking, and the ingredient list is rather simple. If only it didn't have fragrance, but I can compromise with that. The Dr. G has too many unnecessary ingredients and many comedogenic ingredients like myristic acid, so I would stay away from it.",

    "body": "So I spotted the above-named product at the grocery store while meandering past the grooming section.  I picked it up and wondered if it was as good for a primer, as it's neighbor, Nivea Post Shave Balm, has been known to be.  I compared the two products' ingredient lists, and noticed some big differences.\n\n> **Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm**: Water, Glycerin, Isopropyl Palmitate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Bark/Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tapioca Starch, Triceteareth-4 Phosphate, Maltodextrin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol , Piroctone Olamine, Fragrance.\n\n> **Dove Men+Care Post Shave Balm Hydrating+**: Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 MA Crosspolymer, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, DMDM Hydantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Stearic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Panthenol, Sodium Lactate, Triethanolamine, Sodium PCA, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Ceramide 3, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Ceramide 6 II, Ceramide 1\n\nThe first thing that jumped out at me was the inclusion of silicone compounds in the Dove shave balm.  It contains cyclopentasiloxane and dimethicone.  Silicones are absent from the Nivea balm.  This is a pro or a con, depending on your skin type and the base of your foundation.  \n\nThe second thing I noticed that I liked was the inclusion of ceramides in the Dove balm.  However, they're mostly on the tail end of the list, so it's hard to say how much is actually in the products, and if it is present enough to do any good.  Certainly can't hurt.\n\nThe Nivea balm has the benefit of having tapioca starch in it's formulation, which can be good for oil, and it has Witch Hazel extract.  Both balms have pretty good ingredients.  Neither contains drying alcohol.\n\nSo I purchased it.  When I got home, I washed my face, moisturized as normal, then put the Dove balm on the left side of my face and the Nivea balm on the right side.  I eschewed all other primers.  I dabbed a little Maybelline FitMe concealer under my eyes, and used a RT sponge to apply some L'Oreal Infallible Pro-Matte.  The foundation went on very smoothly and did not cake up or pill.  I set it with NYC loose powder.  I added some blush and bronzer for some depth, then I went about my day.\n\nSix hours later, I surveyed the first round of results.  Aside from my foundation being rubbed off of the tip and bottom of my nose (got the flu), both sides looked okay.  I did noticed, however, that the foundation on the right side of my face was more textured.  I could see my pores way clearer than the other side of my face.  Both sides were moderately oily.  The left side of my face was holding up somewhat better than the right side.  I noticed fewer flakes around the dry spots of my face on the left side.  At eight hours, all of these observations were more pronounced.  I noticed more oil on the right side, enough that my pores were \"shining\" with oil.  It was odd.  Neither side looked bad, however.  But for me, the left side (Dove) was winning out in the overall appearance category.  \n\nSo, for my initial testing, Dove Men+Care Post Shave Balm Hydrating did better than Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm, as a foundation primer.  Both have pretty good ingredients, both are alcohol free, and each can serve certain skin types better than the other.  Cheers! ",

        "body": "The \"Bio-Protein Care and infused with Glutamic Amino Serum\" is not doing anything in the formula except giving their marketing people something to talk about.\n\nThe shampoo is also not having much effect on frizz as the only ingredients that might last through rinse-off include the Guar (cationic polymer) and maybe the dimethiconol (silicone).  Although in reality, the dimethiconol mostly gets rinsed away too.\n\nIn the conditioner, the ingredients that are having the greatest impact include the Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Dimethiconol/Silsesquioxane Copolymer, and Behentrimonium Chloride.\n\nThese are all ingredients you can find in other formulas. \n\nThe idea that the smoothing performance is unlike anything on the market is debatable. There are likely lots of products that can give you the smoothing effect of these products. However, using a combination of very good formulas (these are), an appealing fragrance, and solid marketing, you can come to believe it is the best you've ever used.  Just know that you haven't used everything and there are lots of products that you would be happy with if only you could test them on a blinded basis.",

My hair definitely felt smooth and conditioned(a bit on the heavier side), but it was no better than the results I’ve gotten with my loreal dream lengths conditioner. This is just an interesting anecdote, but the people that I HAVE seen rave about this intensive repair conditioner are usually people with chemical damage from bleaching. I have never bleached my hair in my life. I would say my biggest concern is maybe mechanical and heat damage on virgin hair. That’s pretty much it.

Icing on the cake: it's much safer as there's no DMSO !\n\nLet's start simple with the gel part. If you want to know more about that part, read https://thethingswellmake.com/diy-hand-sanitizer-that-actually-works/ which shows why you can't use other gelling agent: the alcohol can denaturate them, like the gelatin protein.\n\nYou might get away with other gelling agents using this low PEG formula, but let's play it safe and use cabomers. If you want to know all the details about them, read https://www.silverson.com/us/resource-library/application-reports/dispersion-and-hydration-of-carbopol \n\nTo get started, let's start easy without touching your precious DHT you got from HK!\n\nMix using a magnetic stirrer or a milk frother:\n\n - 9g of water with a few drop of a food colorant (at the baking aisle - any color will do but I like red lol) \n\n - then 0.5g of carbopol, it takes a while to dissolve even at high speed, there can be bubbles\n\n - then at most 0.2 g of trolamine added drop by drop, using a magnetic stirrer at low speed.\n\nWhen you're done, you got a gel. It may be cloudy - it's just air dissolved inside, if you don't like that you can let it vent out at step 2, before adding the drops.\n\nHow many drops? You decide! If it's thick enough with a few drops? Good, add no more!\n\nIf it's not thick enough to your liking? Add a little more trolamine, simple as that!\n\nYou did a mistake? Discard this mix, and try again! It's all cheap ingredients in very low quantities, that you can buy off ebay by hundred grams or even kilograms.\n\nThese ingredients are in the recipe only to make your gel thick and comfortable to apply. You can totally do without them if you prefer a lotion!\n\nAlso, it's just a starting base for you to experiment: there's more carbopol than needed so you can try to add more water later, and see how it reacts when you mix and add more trolamine drops later. Then try to make mistakes! It's the best way to learn the consequences! Add more water AFTER you have added the trolamine, or don't mix, and you'll see why the order is important thanks to the colorant!\n\nThis simple base allows you to experiment, because like baking, it's the kind of thing where experience is key. Think like a mereingue : the first time you learned, you had to waste a few eggs and a little sugar to get a feeling of what you can get away with!\n\nNow let's look at the patent to get to the serious stuff:\n\n> claim 23.32 : \"2% ethyl oleate as the fatty acid ester, 2% oleic acid as the fatty acid, and 5% propylene glycol as the co-solvent, all by weight of the total weight of the pharmaceutical composition\" -- the rest being water and a bit of carbomer 934 as a gelling agent.\n\nIt would be mixed in the order indicated line 168: PEG, DHT, oleic acid, ethyl oleate, then finally the carbomer gelling - mixing completely after each step.\n\nSo buy all these ingredients, and let's aim to prepare 100g of solution to get started:\n\n - weight 5g propylene glycol, drop in 1g of DHT, mix!\n\n - weight 2g of oleic acid, add to the mix, mix!\n\n - weight 2g of ethyl oleate, add to the mix, mix!\n\nAt this point, you should have 5+2+2+1=10g of homogeneous mix, so now you will be able to add water, carbomer 934 and trolamine to make something as thick as you like, to reach 100g for a 1% DHT target concentration (BTW you want more than 1%? adjust the proportions at step 1!)\n\nTo finish, assuming you want a gel and not a lotion, use the experience you gained doing the carbopol mix:\n\n - start by mixing separately 89g of water, a few drops of colorant and 1g of carbopol together, mix well,\n\n - merge both mixes, then mix both together until the color is homogenous : you don't want streams of red or translucent parts if the colorant was red, just a nice pink allover\n\n - add trolamine drop by drop to get the thickness you have determined you like\n\n - congratulations! you have the best DHT gel on them market!\n\nIt took me a while to write this post. If it helps you, in return, I'd really appreciate if you could make a post explaining in your own words how to do the recipe, ideally taking a few pics of the process and uploading them somewhere.\n\nThid would really help others, as there's no DHT gel on the market in North America, while it's so important for the beard and bottom growth!",

Just because it takes the # of reviews into account. You can find lots of good reviews vouching for very good products with lesser amount of reviews. It doesn't necessarily mean that just because a product is extremely popular, there can't be lesser known amazing products as well. For some categories, like toners and creams, I feel that it's worth to look all the way down towards the 40s and 50s. I think I will make certain categories longer if you guys don't mind my spamming, lol.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm thinking doing creams or gels next. =) Thank you everybody for the comments, glad to see the time I spent making these posts is helping some of you!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Oils & Gels](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6dqq7/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing_oils_gels/)\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Balms/Milks/Creams & Foams](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6fso3/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing/)",

They don't always appear as \"ceramide \\_\\_\", there are other names for them, such as:\n\nHydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, Myristoyl/​Palmitoyl Oxostearamide/​Arachamide MEA, Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide, Hydroxypalmitoyl Sphinganine, [Safflower Oil/​Palm Oil Aminopropanediol Esters](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/safflower-oil-palm-oil-aminopropanediol-esters), etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo today I wanted to make a list of products that are easily overlooked when searching for ceramide skincare, because many people are only looking for the word \"ceramide\".

    "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nJust wanted to put out a quick review on this mask.  I hardly ever use sheet masks as most of them make me itchy (even the Klairs Supple Prep mask).  Luckily, this one did not and really hydrated my skin, which lasts through the next day.\n\nThese are pretty good!  Maybe even great, depending on your skin's needs.\n\nThey come split into two parts.  The mask material itself is cross-hatched and sturdy.  You can give it a good tug while fitting it on our face and it's no big deal.  Other than that, it feels like regular mask material (cotton).  The fit for me was good.  It was definitely big enough to cover most my (normal-sized) face with a bit to spare.  \n\nVery saturated with the juice.  It's not a creamy formula, just the usual serum style.  And get this...NO FRAGRANCE.  I know many people love the nice smelling stuff, but this one is great option for people who can't tolerate it.  Plus it has tons of ceramides.\n\nIn terms of how long until the masks drys out...well I've never made it that far.  I wore one yesterday for 40min (youtube! stop being so distracting!), pulled it off and it was still soggy.\n\n\n**Ingredients List:** Water, Butylene glycol, glycerin, 1,2-hexanediol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycereth-26, Propanediol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Panthenol, Betaine, Allantoin, Cellulose, Hydroxyethyl cellulose, Sodium hyaluronate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hydrogenated lecithin, Ceramide NP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide AP, Ceramide AS, Ceramide EOP, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Carbomer, Arginine, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Acetate, PVM/MA Copolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Glyceryl Acrylate/ Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n\nOverall, I would rate this mask positively.  It's hydrating and benign...which is what I look for in a mask.\n\n\n**Pros:**\n\nGood material\n\nNo fragrance\n\nHydrating AF\n\n\n**Cons:**\n\nCost (USD 3$/mask)\n\n\nEdit: my goodness I need to learn to spell",

A paper on penetration enhancers suggest 63% ethanol gives the best absorption for steroids: https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addr.2012.09.032\n\nTurns out, there's an easily available commercial product made of pure premixed 60% ethanol: Everclear 120\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everclear_(alcohol)\n\nThis makes plan C currently more interesting than anything else, as carbomer are hard to find since everybody is making hand gel against the virus.\n\nWe know E2 can be diluted in ethanol up to 20mg/ml, and Everclear 120 comes in 750 ml bottles.\n\nAssuming a safety margin of about half due to the dilution, 10mg/ml means that in theory you could put 7500mg or 7.5 g into a bottle of Everclear.\n\nAs you need  3mg/day, this bottle should last you (7500/3)/365 = 6.8 years.\n\nThe 7.5 grams of E2 on alibaba cost between 1 to 3 USD per gram, assuming the worst case + 50 USD shipping, 7.5*3 +50=72 USD, add to that a bottle of Everclear 120 which costs 17 USD according to https://www.hangoverprices.com/everclear-prices/ \n\n72+17=89 USD, for almost 7 years worth of HRT.\n\nWe're still sorting out some details, including the dispenser (spray? vial making drops?) and the extra penetration enhancers as \nthe original recipe for Lenzetto spray calls for 5x more octisalate in weight than E2. It is not clear how necessary this octisalate is.\n\nYet so far everything is going great, and now is the time to spread the word. \n\nIf you're into chemistry or pharmacology or biology, please join and help us!\n\nIf you're not in any of that but want to help, please share this information wherever - trans subs, blogs, twitter - the more eyeballs can help us fix details, the better!",

The powder may be between 1 to 3 USD per gram, however they usually won't allow you to buy below a certain threshold. Having scoured across different sellers and messaging many before finally settling on one, it's apparent that different sellers have a differing minimum weight that can be purchased. Some will not sell below 50g, some not below 100g, some even claimed to sell 20g but then after a couple of days of having spoken to their supposed 'supervisors', then inform you that they indeed cannot go below 50g. This isn't including the postage and packaging fees, which also from my experience have been relatively hefty. They're usually not a cheaper fee of \\~10-20USD, they're more like 40-60USD freight fee. \n\nSo, while in the long term this solution may be cheaper and last a long time, you need to have the funds upfront to be sorted for the foreseeable future. \n\nJust thought that was worth mentioning.",

Not exactly sure exactly which countries sell the ‘Made in China’ version, but Google has confirmed it’s sold in Singapore and Malaysia.\n\nThe major difference is that the Japanese version contains Tranexamic Acid, Vit C derivative, and Vit E. The ‘Made in China’ version contains Niacinamide, alpha-Arbutin, Vitamin C, and Reservatol. Interestingly, the Japanese version also mentions nano hyaluronic acid while the ‘Made in China’ version does not.\n\nInterestingly, the SEA version that was ‘Made in China’ **did** feature the same ingredients as the Japanese version with TA. The only difference was where it was made (China vs Japan). This was reformulated sometime in 2022 (around June/July/August, if I remember correctly) to the current arbutin and niacinamide version.\n\n# ‘Made in Japan’ Japanese version:\n\n* **Images:**\n\n1.

Skin pH balanced. Low irritation.

I also did some broad research, and it seems like the lotions they sell to worldwide markets are the Japanese version *with* TA.\n\nI’m so curious to know why they reformulated it in their Chinese factory but kept the same formula for their Japanese factory. Would love to hear any thoughts and/or theories!",

    "body": "My foray into skincare began around July last year when I decided I wasn't happy with my skin and wanted to do something about it. Initially I researched foundations, but none of the products I tried evened my skin to my satisfaction, which is when I found /r/SkincareAddiction. Here, I learned that my skin was dehydrated, more than likely due to using Dove bar soap and BP on my face and zero moisturizer every day. :) My skin has changed so much since I started and I am finally ready to review some products I have been using and maybe help others find their way.  \n**Disclaimer** This is my first Reddit text post, I'm really hoping the formatting turns out the way I anticipated.  \n\n**Where we started:**  \n* 25/F/FL; combo/oily dehydrated skin with mild acne, some PIE, sporadic CCs and occasionally painful nodules usually on my forehead, chin, or temples. Noteworthy: I have been on oral contraceptives since I was a teenager and switched to Skyla in 2015. I don't believe my acne is hormonal, but since I've always had some sort of hormonal birth control it's hard to tell how much it has affected my skin.  \n\n\n* No real routine, just washing my face with bar soap in the (scalding hot) shower, using a Neutrogena BP mask to annihilate acne. I was under the (false) impression that since my face was oily I certainly wouldn't want to add moisturizer!  \n\n\n* Mostly concerned with the nodules I was getting because they were big and painful and took forever to heal. Admittedly, I am a skin picker and just recently I realized this is probably the cause of the nodules because the two that I have dealt with recently developed in spots that I had messed with just a few days before.  \n\n\n**Level one: Build a routine.**  \n* At this point, I read everything. EVERYTHING. I spent a couple of months just researching products, learning about skin types, and poring through threads on SCA. I put down the BP mask and bought Neutrogena foaming face wash and CeraVe PM. This was around September when Irma hit and I was without power for a few days, but still managed to keep my fledgling routine. \\o/\n\n* Unfortunately, I felt that CeraVe PM was contributing to a new outbreak of whiteheads around my mouth, where I don't normally get whiteheads. I wound up replacing it with Peach Slices Citrus Honey Aqua Glow which I LOVE. More on that later.\n\n* I also incorporated Neutrogena Sheer Touch sunscreen around this time, but that gave me small breakouts as well and I just didn't like the way that it sat on my skin so I decided to put sunscreen on hold while I did more research.\n\n* While incorporating these products into my routine I tried my best to follow SCA's advice and start slow, one product at a time, and patch test first. I don't really feel that patch testing helped me determine if a product would break me out, as I wouldn't notice any difference in the area I patch tested but then within a few days of trying a new product on my whole face I would see an increase in whiteheads in strange areas. It sucked, but it's alright since the breakouts were mild and didn't take long to appear so I knew fairly quickly that a product wasn't working for me. I still recommend patch testing for sensitivity purposes.\n\n**Level 2: Sunscreen and acids.**  \n* Finally, after months of reading, I felt ready to take on an acid. I settled on CosRX BHA Blackhead Power liquid because it was purportedly more mild (and less expensive!) than other options and I felt that I should start gentle. I picked this up from Ulta in early December and used it every three days for 4 weeks. During that period I don't feel like I had a purge; I kind of expected my acne to go into overdrive but it didn't really get any worse. After the 4 weeks I started using it MWF. \n\n* I also bought Skinfood's Aloe Watery Sun Water Gel from Amazon, but shipping took about a month so I was able to incorporate it well after the BHA.\n\n**Level 3: Skincare God.**  \n* *Just kidding.* So here we are in mid April and I have repurchased the Neutrogena cleanser once (although I switched to hydrating instead of foaming), Peach Slices moisturizer three (!!!) times, Skinfood sunscreen once, and am 1/3 of the way through the CosRX BHA. Let me tell you, I am SO much happier with my skin. \n\n* My skin is more bright and even and I have had much fewer blemishes than I used to, which I would attribute equally to a marked decrease in picking. Taking better care of my skin and working towards a goal makes it easier to keep myself from messing up my progress, although I still have setbacks during times when I am very stressed out, but I try not to let that discourage me.\n\n* Oil production WAS down, but a couple of weeks ago I tried to incorporate Cosrx Ultimate Moisturizing Honey Overnight Mask at night for added hydration, but it wound up drying me out? Additionally, I am running dangerously low on Peach Slices Moisturizer and could not find it at any of my local CVS locations so I have been rationing it while I wait for more to come in the mail. :'( \n\n* From here, I want to try to find a more hydrating cream for nighttime and an easily accessible drugstore sunscreen because currently it takes the Skinfood 2-4 weeks to come in so I have to make sure I order it in advance. I also REALLY want to try Krave Beauty Kale-lalu-yAHA, but I am waiting until I get back from vacation next month before I incorporate a new exfoliant. Finally, someone talk me out of buying something from the Dr Jart Cicapair line because I'm not quite sure what it's for but I really want it.\n\nI hope this will be helpful for those still figuring out what works for their skin, as I know I felt completely overwhelmed when I first started. I am still interested in experimenting with new products but I feel that I have a really solid routine as it is so I am content to wait until I am in a better situation financially to mix things up.\n\n**Current routine**  \nAM: splash with water  \nPeach Slices moisturizer  \nSkinfood sunscreen  \n\nPM: cleanse with Neutrogena  \nCosRX BHA MWF  \nPeach Slices moisturizer  \nSometimes a sheet mask when I'm feeling fancy (I really like Ariul Seven Days masks)  \nVaseline (not so much lately after I read a thread here about Vaseline potentially trapping bacteria if your face isn't cleansed properly)\n\n**Reviews**  \n* Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser: Not much to say here, but from what I have read that is good to say about a cleanser. It took a little time to get used to not having that tight, \"squeaky clean\" feeling that I got using the foaming cleanser, but ultimately I think this has been better for my skin. I have had my eye on Glossier's Milky Jelly cleanser for MONTHS but I can't bring myself to buy it when I am pretty satisfied with how this has been for my skin.\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Glucoside, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol*\n\n* Peach Slices Citrus Honey Aqua Glow: Light gel formula, sinks into my skin really well. I am still a bit oily toward the end of the day, but I have kind of resigned myself to the fact that that may not fully go away. Maybe when I start incorporating a more hydrating night cream it will help. Either way the slight oil doesn't bother me much and I really like this moisturizer.\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Polysorbate 60, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Honey Extract, Ceramide NP, Sorbitan Stearate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Isohexadecane, Tromethamine, Hydroxyacetophenone, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Polysorbate 80, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitan Oleate, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Oil, Disodium EDTA, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Butylene Glycol, Bixa Orellana Seed Oil, Tocopherol*\n\n* Skinfood Aloe Watery Sun Water Gel 50+ PA+++: Very happy with this sunscreen, although the oil control is hit or miss. Some days when I apply it after moisturizer it has a nice, almost powdery finish and I forget it's even there. Some days I'm more oily but I'm still figuring out what the cause of that might be. I don't wear foundation so I can't speak to how this sits under makeup but I do wear a little blush and I can still see it at the end of the day. When I apply it I pat it around my face and then rub it in, there is a slight white cast at first but for me it disappears very quickly, however, I am fair skinned.\n\n*Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Octyl Methoxycinnamate, Octyl Salicylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Peg/Ppg-10/1 Dimethicone, Lauryl Peg-9 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Stearalkonium Hectorite, Titanium Dioxide, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Propylene Carbonate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Fragrance, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Tocopherol*\n\n* CosRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid: I use three pumps MWF and occasionally a tiny amount to spot treat nodules. Overall I feel like it helps existing acne heal more quickly and keeps it from getting to that huge, inflammatory state. It applies and dries down very nicely and I typically wait 15-20 minutes after application to apply moisturizer. I didn't realize until recently that it has niacinamide, which I had thought didn't agree with my skin because it was also in CeraVe PM, but I think it has really helped lighten my PIE, particularly a spot on my forehead that I really went to town on last year and it was a pain in the ass to heal.\n\n*Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Water, Butylene Glycol, Betaine Salicylate, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Arginine, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol*\n\n**Links that I found helpful along the way**  \n[Try a gentle hydrating cleanser -- even if you have oily skin.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7j6juf/psa_try_a_gentle_hydrating_cleanser_even_if_you/)\n\n[Routines which involve inadequate cleansing, high moisture, and heavy occlusion are risky...](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/86twai/psa_routines_which_involve_inadequate_cleansing/)",

Probably because Olay developed it. But it works great on its own as a brightener, and even better combined with vitamin c (which is why you see ascorbyl glucoside here, a stable derivative of ascorbic acid). The miracle boost USED to contain n-acetyl glucosamine (which is the one I used) as well the other ones listed here. But I guess it got too expensive or whatever.\n\nThis also has some other great ingredients, like xylitol, gylcerin, panthenol, zinc and copper gluconate for soothing and healing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used this booster in conjunction with the Luminous cream, which has niacinamide and NAG. My skin looked so much brighter and prettier. The texture was really smoothed out and my skin started getting a more like.. translucent ?? quality? You DO need to give brightening ingredients *at least 3 months* to work their magic though, especially for things like arbutin/hydroquinone. (Arbutin breaks down into hydroquinone.) But for niacinamide, I saw results for skin texture/overall brightening before that.\n\nI honestly couldn't believe the price Target was selling it for, because I got it for a much higher price elsewhere before. I couldn't keep affording it so I let it go, sadly. :'(\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe [**Luminous Tone Perfecting Treatment ($24.99)**](https://www.olay.com/en-us/skin-care-products/regenerist-luminous-tone-perfecting-treatment) is a simpler formula, but still has the same active ingredients.\n\n*Water,* ***Niacinamide\\*****, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Dimethicone,* ***Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine***\\*, Silica, Boron Nitride,\\* ***Ascorbyl Glucoside***\\*, Polyglyceryl-2 Oleate, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Dimethiconol, Aminomethyl Propanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Oleate, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium EDTA, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, \\*Vitamin B3\\*\n\nBut ironically, it costs more than the more complex booster if you purchase at Target online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DIY:**\n\nI have made DIY niacinamide NAG serums before. But because I'm too lazy to make it properly, they really lack penetration power. I'm really into cosmetic science and have read from professional cosmetic chemists that a simple DIY isn't effective if you don't do it right. You gotta keep the powders dissolved right and STAY dissolved instead of them recrystallizing on your skin and not penetrating your skin/being useless. I experimented for months with the DIY but I DEFINITELY noticed a difference as soon as I started using well-formulated, commercially available niacinamide serums.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy personal experience with certain products:\n\n\\- [**Eva Naturals 5% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-Niacinamide-Serum-Eva-Naturals/dp/B0147PDMYY/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=eva+naturals+niacinamide&amp;qid=1561763684&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3)**:** Pretty awesome, works well, you get 2 oz. But it has avocado oil and such, and may break some people out. (This is definitely a private-label product and you can find the same exact formula for cheaper on DIY sites - which is why you see like 324982394 bottles of the same formula of everything from niacinamide to vitamin c serums on amazon.) I get the same sort of overall brightening and translucency I get with Olay. Better results with my other products, Benton 0.5% salicylic acid (very gentle) aloe BHA toner, Purito green level centella buffet serum (also has niacinamide, like 2%), and Naturie Hatomugi gel essence. Bright, translucent skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Cerave PM:** Supposedly has 4% niacinamide. Loved this as a lightweight moisturizer, but did NOT see the results I got with other niacinamide products. Makes me feel skeptical. Or perhaps there's a pretty big difference for my skin with 4% and 5%. I doubt it, but you know. Maybe it's just cuz it's formulated for skin-replenishing and not for brightening. But you'd think same ingredient will have same effects, y'know?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Skinlex 10% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.skinlex.com/product/10-niacinamide-serum-60ml/)**:** Ingredient list looks GREAT and some others seem to love it, but I saw absolutely zero niacinamide benefits for my skin. Penetration issue?\n\nI have other products I've used with niacinamide, but these are the main ones I can remember on the top of my head. La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+ baume has it as well, but I do not know the %. Very good moisturizer for the body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther commercial products you can find SEPIWHITE in:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Black Opal skin care products**](https://blackopalbeauty.com/collections/skincare): They have multiple.

    "body": "In my opinion the only way ascorbic acid may potentially work topically is when it's used fresh, and applied at night in the absence of UV exposure. Personally I don't believe in preformulated water based ascorbic acid products. Even when it's fresh the amount of studies that prove that vitamin c really works topically is quite limited. Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water. The key here is to make it fresh every 1-3 days I guess.\n  * [€5.80/20g TO Powder](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-l-ascorbic-acid-powder-20g?redir=1)\n  * [€89 /20mL Philosophy Turbo C booster](https://www.sephora.com/product/turbo-booster-c-powder-P204606)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Anhydrous formulas**: best stability, but not much research on penetration\n\n* [€9.60/50mL - The Ordinary C23](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml?redir=1)\n  * **Pros:** Cheap, anhydrous (stable), together with TO Ferulic+Resveratrol a very affordable good combo\n  * **Cons:** No other actives,  no vitamin E, relatively unpleasant texture, stinging, for me too thick/greasy for daytime use.

It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

Even Huda advertised her skincare launch for WEEKS before she had the first product. I feel like of anyone, Huda would be able to launch a skincare brand day of and the product would sell out. Her and Beyoncé maybe. \n\nIf this new launch was such a big deal, it would have been one of the first products they advertised for premium. Like “hey! If you sign up for premium, you’ll be one of the first people to try this brand new brand! And we are going to educate you on it all month so you are super hyped to use it!”\n\nFinding a product on Alibaba with the exact same packaging and name for $2 is so sketchy... especially when you have 0 internet presence, if you were gonna fake people out like this in a smart way they would have made sure that as soon as you googled the product or company their website would show up first. Even fake a couple product reviews.\n\nI’m so confused about how this possibly happened. Like they’ve had weird brands like Illuminati sponges in their boxes before but no one cares about that because it’s just a cheap sponge. Not exciting,  but also no one is gonna look up their sponge to see the ingredients etc. because it’s just a sponge. It’s different with skincare. \n\nI saw someone on Instagram way “this should have gone in the base box” no... don’t do us dirty like that. How this ever made it in a box is very confusing.

    "body": "Hi everyone! \n\n12 days ago, we were at 2.6k subscribers, today we are at 3.5k! That’s **huge**! We’re so excited in this growth and the thought provoking and interesting discussions that have sprouted in such a short time.\n\nDo you like the new CSS? /u/smallrobots is a beautiful wizard and put this together while I was sleeping. If you see any issues or areas of improvement, please let us know!\n\n---\n#Asian Beauty Network\n \nAs the Reddit Asian Beauty community grows, it has become increasingly obvious that a single catch all subreddit no longer fits the needs of the community. \n \nr/abdiscussion was created to be a thoughtful discussion oriented space, and was always intended to be a companion subreddit. That's why we’re really happy to work together with a group of dedicated moderators to be part a network of subreddits that allows you to create the perfect AB Reddit experience for you.\n \n* /r/AsianBeautyRehab\n* r/asianbeautyexchange \n* r/ABCJ \n* r/ABCJDiscussion and  \n* r/AsianBeautyAdvice. \n \nEach space caters to a different need, you can find them all [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeautyNetwork) with an explanation of what each subreddit focuses on. \n \nThere’s also a multireddit feed which can be found [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/user/stufstuf/m/asianbeautynetwork/) that you can copy, save  and edit!\n \nWith that in mind, this post will outline how we intend to manage Reviews, Help Threads and The Wiki on ABDiscussion.\n\n\n--- \n#Reviews\nReviews are back, with a format and a dedicated weekly thread! Thank you to /u/rumazazil for the initial template.\n \nAlongside Asian Beauty Reader’s Digest Monday, Monday will also feature a Review Thread! Each month, we will have a Monthly Review thread based on a central theme based on an interesting discussion topic raised by the community.\n \nReviews using the review structure are encouraged in the ‘Ingredients and Studies Tuesday’, ‘Makeup Discussion Wednesday’ and ‘Miscellaneous AB Thursday’ Weekly threads. \n  \n##Format\n \n* **Full Product Name**:\n* **Skin Type/Skin Tone/Current Climate**:\n* **Reason for Use**:\n* **Product Size & Price**:  \n* **Packaging**: \n* **Ingredients**: \n* **Product smell, texture & finish**:\n* **Product effects compared to claims**: \n* **Where it fits in the routine & how it behaves with other products**:\n* **How long it has been used for**:\n* **Has it been/will it be repurchased**:\n* **Concluding remarks**:\n\n*example*:\n\n* **Full Product Name**:  Neogen Bio-Peel Gauze Peeling Lemon\n* **Skin Type/Skin Tone/Current Climate**: Oily, acne prone, humid and cold.\n* **Reason for Use**: For gentle exfoliation\n* **Product Size & Price**: Box of 8 pads, price unknown as it was a sponsor gift. \n* **Packaging**: Individually wrapped pads in a foil pouch. I really like this set because it makes it easy to carry around for overnight stays or on the plane.\n* **Ingredients**: Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Alcohol Denat., PEG/PPG017/6 Copolymer, Sodium Hyaluronate, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract , Cymbopogon Citratus Extract, Citrus Unshiu Peel Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Tricholoma Matsutake Extract, Cordyceps Sinensis Extract , Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Extract, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Fruit Extract, Saururus Chinensis Leaf/Root Extract, Arnica Montana Flower Extract, Artemisia Absinthium Extract, Broussonetia Kazinoki Bark Extract, Coptis Chinensis Root Extract , PEG-60 Hydrogenated Cator Oil, Carbomer, Tartaric Acid , Glycolic Acid , Lactic Acid , Tromethamine, Disodium EDTA, Benzophenone-5, CI 19140, CI 17200, Fragrance\n* **Product smell, texture & finish**: It smells like lemon, which is really off putting as I've had lemon = bad drilled into my head. It leaves a sticky finish but you have to wash it off. \n* **Product effects compared to claims**: Claims - \"this product provides gentle yet effective exfoliation of dead skin cells and impurities, leaving skin smoother and clear.\" Sure, I guess? It's gentle, but I didn't think it left it particularly smoother than any of my regular acid products.\n* **Where it fits in the routine & how it behaves with other products**: I use it as my acid step after cleansing, but it's a wash off acid, so you have to bear that in mind.\n* **How long it has been used for**: I've used two pads so far.\n* **Has it been/will it be repurchased**: Has not been repurchased, and will not be repurchased.\n* **Concluding remarks**: I like them well enough and I'm glad I got to try it because those tubs have been super inviting, and I've been lemming HARD. But honestly it just hasn't wowed me to make me want to use it often. Especially as I have to wash it off, which is like, WHY. This is effort, I don't see a huge change and compared to the Innisfree Green Barley Peeling Pad, it's pretty meh. What I will say is that you can use it as a body pad just before a shower which is actually not bad because it is mega mega soaked in product.\n \n\nIf there are other points you think should be included in the template or removed, please let us know. \n\n--- \n#Help Threads, Asking for Advice & The Wiki \nFor the foreseeable future we will not have help threads. The daily threads are discussion threads, not help threads, so while advice has been freely given we want to make it very clear that **no member of the community is obligated to give advice or help anyone**. Every discussion topic should feel like a slumber party where you're talking stuff out with your friends. Advice should be part of an organic discussion. \n \nInstead of, “I'm NW15, should I buy The Face Shop Super Ultra Cool to the MAX in 13?”\n \nTry, “It's summer and I've seen a lot of cooling cushions around that make me really curious. Do they work? I have no idea! I read this review that said they do and this one that says they don't. My NW15 skin thinks they're a gimmick, but I'm tempted to get this The Face Shop Super Ultra Cool to the MAX in 13 I found on Peony Peony Store. Anyone tried any cooling products from this line?”\n\nPlease remember, if you can easily do an internet search for the answer, you should do so, not expect anyone else to do it for you.\n\nAs r/AsianBeautyAdvice have awesome plans for a wiki, we will not be curating one in the traditional sense.  \n \n--- \n#Other Points:\n\n**Flairs**\n\nThere is also no need for post flairs as everything should be a discussion! \n\nOther than no self promotion (ie no link to your blog/external platform) we have no restrictions on personal flairs. Skin type, location and skin tone are common flair content, but you can also have fun with it as long as it isn’t offensive.\n \nAn example of suitable flairs would be:\n \n* Snail enthusiast\n* Dry/Sensitive Skin | Australia\n* NW20 | Passionate about AB makeup!\n* Tony Moly Banana Pack needs more love\n \n\n**Blogger, Businesses & External Content Creators:**\n\nNo shameless self promotion and no stand alone threads centered around your content. All content creators must follow a 10:1 rule, where for every post of self promotion (ie, relevant link to external content in a discussion post) there must be 10 posts that have nothing to do with themselves or their brand.\n \nIf you are a blogger or external content creator you are expected to participate as any other member of the community, there will be no special flair given.\n \n**Business Rules:** \n\nBusiness representatives who are hoping to post on behalf of their business (ie, clarify ingredient list, or use of product) must first identify themselves to the moderators and they will be given a special flair. Failure to do so will result in all unverified ‘official’ posts being removed.\n \nBasically, you have to prove you’re posting on behalf of Jolse before we let you post on behalf of Jolse.\n \n \n \n#Next Steps:\n\nWe are looking for new mods! Horray!\n \nUS Timezone preferably as I am in the EU and /u/smallrobots is in AUS.\n \nWe are looking for 3 mods:\n\n* 1 CSS Dedicated mod, has no other responsibilities. \n* 3 to help with the day to day moderation. \n\nThis involves clearing out the spam queue, moderating to the rules and responding to modmail.\n \nIf you are interested please send us a modmail with the title, “ABD Mod Application” with a little bit of information about yourself and why you think you would be a great mod!\n\n---\n\n#Thank you!\n\nThat's it for now, thank you guys for all your feedback, we are always listening and we are always working to make ABD the best space we possibly can. New rules take effect immediately, and the sidebar will be updated to reflect that from tomorrow.\n\nAs always, the comments are open for your comments! We'd love to hear from you to explain, clarify or just discuss your thoughts!",

    "body": "Evenprime Daily Moisturizer\n\nWhen I think about what I want in the perfect daily moisturizer things like long-lasting hydration, soothing, nourishment, and brightening come to mind. Luckily, I have found a couple great products this year including the Good Skin Days On The Bright Side Moisturizer and Pureforet Centella Multi Lotion.\n\nAnd, I’m happy to say I’ve found another awesome option with the Evenprime Daily Moisturizer.\n\nThis ingredient packed lotion features niacinamide, panthenol, allantoin, sunflower seed oil, chamomile, licorice root, madecassoside, ferment filtrate, and several forms of hyaluronic acid...essentially covering all of my bases.\n\nIn addition, the lightweight gel/cream contains knotweed, mushroom extracts, and soybean seed extract to add a boost of antioxidant and anti-irritation properties. Seriously, this is one of the most well-formulated and impressive ingredients lists I have seen in a single product.\n\nBringing things home...the Evenprime Daily Moisturizer absorbs incredibly quickly without leaving behind a film, residue, or heavy feeling making it perfect for my oily/combination/changes every day skin. \n\nOver time I have really appreciated how this moisturizer helps to calm my skin, provide a decent amount of hydration, and even enhanced the brightening effects of my exfoliation/essence steps. I honestly cannot get enough of this product!\n\nBut, now that the cooler weather is upon us alongside the dryness in the air (hello Colorado)...I’ve found myself looking for a bit more in the way of emollient “moisture locking” products. The Evenprime Daily Moisturizer hasn’t provided quite enough recently, especially for my pm routine.\n\nWhile I have been able to work around this by incorporating the Solved Skincare Jojoba Oil Serum into the mix (3 drops in the am and 6 in the pm), I could see those with particularly dry skin looking for more. \n\nThe Evenprime Daily Moisturizer is still an incredible product that I think just about anyone could see some benefit from...and rumor has it there might be a heavier version in the works! But for now, I’ll be continuing to add an extra boost and then reaching for something more rich in the coming months.\n\nFull Ingredients List: WATER (AQUA), GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, POLYGLYCERYL-3 METHYLGLUCOSE DISTEARATE, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, NIACINAMIDE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, SORBITAN STEARATE, ADENOSINE, ALLANTOIN, PANTHENOL, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL, SEA WATER (MARIS AQUA), CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA (MATRICARIA) FLOWER EXTRACT, GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA (LICORICE) ROOT EXTRACT, GALACTOMYCES FERMENT FILTRATE , PENTYLENE GLYCOL, POLYGONUM MULTIFLORUM ROOT EXTRACT, PHELLINUS LINTEUS EXTRACT, ANGELICA GIGAS ROOT EXTRACT, PAEONIA LACTIFLORA ROOT EXTRACT, SESAMUM INDICUM (SESAME) SEED EXTRACT, SOPHORA FLAVESCENS ROOT EXTRACT, CIMICIFUGA RACEMOSA ROOT EXTRACT, MORUS ALBA BARK EXTRACT, SCUTELLARIA BAICALENSIS ROOT EXTRACT, CENTELLA ASIATICA LEAF EXTRACT, SODIUM HYALURONATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE CROSSPOLYMER, HYDROLYZED HYALURONIC ACID, HYALURONIC ACID, HYDROLYZED SODIUM HYALURONATE, MADECASSOSIDE, CARBOMER, TROMETHAMINE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, XANTHAN GUM, SODIUM PHYTATE, BETAINE\n\nWhere To Buy (Evenprime Site - $32.00 USD - 50ml): [https://evenprime.co/collections/all/products/evenprime-moisturizer](https://evenprime.co/collections/all/products/evenprime-moisturizer) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3fpmjp8sm3w51.jpg?width=4478&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed52b4aa2ef9dc48a80f5148feea62f55e8f8c83",

I should also add I've never tried the original version. I wear no makeup other than mascara.\n\n**Full Routine (at the time):**\n\n*Morning:*\n\n* Rinse with water\n* Illiyoon Ato Ceramide Concentrate Cream\n* Scinic Super Mild Enjoy Sun Essence SPF 50 PA++++\n\n*Evening:*\n\n* La Roche Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Facial Cleanser\n* Illiyoon Ato Ceramide Concentrate Cream\n* either Vaseline or tretinoin cream (0.05%) *(once every three nights for tretinoin)*\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n    Water,  Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Pentaerythrityl  Tetraisostearate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Stearic Acid, Behenyl  Alcohol, Palmitic Acid, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Arachidyl  Alcohol, C14-22 Alcohols, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA(Ceramide  PC-104), Polyacrylate-13, Arachidyl Glucoside, Mannitol, C12-20 Alkyl  Glucoside, Polyisobutene, Glyceryl Caprylate, Panax Ginseng Root Water,  Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer,  Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Carbomer, Perilla Ocymoides Seed  Extract, Myristic Acid, Arachidic Acid, Cholesterol, Bupleurum Falcatum  Root Extract, Angelica Acutiloba Root Extract, Ophiopogon Japonicus Root  Extract, Glucose, Silica, Glycine Max (Soybean) Oil, Ceramide NP,  Phytosphingosine, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Tocopherol, Canola Oil,  Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract \n\n**Initial thoughts:** The cream is really thick and it reminds me almost of drug store stuff with Shea butter in it. I’ve heard some people say that they can smell rosemary extract in it, but it’s so light that I truly can’t tell if I’m smelling the ingredients or the extract (the rosemary extract is the last ingredient). The little beads break down really quickly and settle nicely. This is one of the few moisturizers I’ve tried that feel truly “nourishing” on the face so far. It’s hard for me to find stuff to hold in water so this is a pleasant discovery. As far as any film, if I drag my finger on my face, I can feel something, but it dries matte-ish/natural finish. I can stretch my face and it feels very elastic compared to when I feel dry. So far, I’m impressed.\n\n**AM Usage:** I found that it did not make my face look greasy and kept it quite hydrated for a long time, but the scinic was quite drying and eventually my sunscreen would siphon the water out of my face, particularly in the anteromedial cheek region (the skin that connects to the side of the nose, under the eyes and the rest of the cheek). It did its best to stand up to it as much as it could without making me greasy (I tested other moisturizers and the same thing happened, so its not just this one). I began to notice some pimples on my face after using it for a week that just wouldn't go away, and I postulated that this must be the culprit. I decided to use it as a summertime body balm, but I also broke out on my back and shoulders (where I applied it). I am sooooooooo sad about this because it's otherwise really lightweight. It doesn't really hold much moisture on the rest of my skin.\n\n**PM Usage:** I found it was comfortable to buffer with tret. It held the moisture in my skin all night long and felt comfortable by the morning. Very few moisturizers do this.\n\n**Conclusion:** While it has an airy finish and is very moisturizing, I did have break outs from it (maybe due to some of the fatty acid concentrations). It's a great value for its price. I wanted to post this review as not many reference breakouts; however, there are some. I would think it's worth at least a try, but please just be a little wary if you're very acne-prone.\n\n**Final Rating:** *6.5/10, WNRP because of the breakouts*\n\n**Pros + Cons List:**\n\n|Pros:|Cons:|\n|:-|:-|\n|moisturizing, yet mattifying and lightweight|break-outs|\n|good for dehydrated skin|not exactly the best body balm|\n|great value||\n|can buffer tret||\n\n&#x200B;",

    "body": "[Here](https://imgur.com/a/Mnijy) are some pictures of the goods! \n\nWhen you get a haul, even a mini one, there is always at least one thing that doesn't work out the way you thought it would. For my finicky skin, it's usually several things. So I was ***shocked*** when not only did everything from my recent AB haul work for me, but it all worked ***really*** well. So well that I wanted to share my excitement with all of you! I'm still mildly in disbelief right now, this never happens. \n\nCVS was having a BOGO 50% off sale so I decided to try a couple things that I’ve had my eye on. I thought these reviews might be helpful for those in this sub that aren’t very familiar with AB products. My routine is a mix of different types of brands (I do love my French pharmacy products) but I’ve had a lot more luck finding things that work for my skin type in the AB world. Some people get scared off at the idea of ordering things from overseas - either because of shipping cost or the length of shipping times. Since these are all products carried at CVS, they are a lot more accessible for those in the US. \n\n**Skin type:** Oily, dehydration-prone, sometimes sensitive (depends on its mood that day), with a very low tolerance for silicones. \n\n**Holika Holika Aloe Cleansing Foam -** I've had rough luck with foaming cleansers as they all seem to strip my skin (other than my HG LRP Toleraine but it's fun to switch it up sometimes). Not this guy! My skin loves anything aloe and this did not disappoint (aloe is the best humectant for oily skin imo). It has a very dense, thick foam that feels very nice on my skin. The scent is very fresh, it almost reminds me of fresh-cut watermelon and aloe mixed together. It leaves my skin very soft and not remotely stripped. No squeaky-clean feeling here! I'm not positive of the pH but it does contain potassium hydroxide (a pH adjuster) so I'm assuming it's in the normal range and not on the higher end. I think this is going to make a great AM cleanser since it's so gentle. \n\nIngredients: \nAloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Water, Lauryl Hydroxysultaine, Myristic Acid, Lauric Acid, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Chlorphenesin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Palmitic Acid, Capric Acid, Butylene Glycol, Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Potassium Sorbate.\n\n(*Ah-ha! I just saw the watermelon extract as I was adding this, so that explains the lovely scent.)\n\n**Peach Slices Citrus-Honey Aqua Glow Hydrating Moisture Gel -** Holy shit you guys, this is ***everything*** I've been looking for in a winter moisturizer. It's lightweight, a gel, has ceramides, is hydrating *and* moisturizing and doesn't make me oily. The search is over! Seriously, I've been trying to find the perfect moisturizer for about 8 months now. I thought I had the perfect one (Etude House Moistfull Collagen Water Jelly Cream) but turns out it was perfect *for summer*. Once winters cold, dry air came it just wasn't enough. I've desperately wanted to add ceramides to my routine with no luck (Rosette Ceramide Gel was a greasy disaster). The inclusion of ceramides is what originally caught my eye and also the lack of any -cones. My skin is sensitive to silicones and finding a heavier winter moisturizer without any has been virtually impossible. This does include a couple -anes so I was skeptical at first but they don’t seem to bother me as much as straight up dimethicone. Dimethicone + my skin = a greasy mess and lots of clogged pores (and fun little whiteheads all over). The first time I used it, I squeezed out too much but thought 'what the heck, I'll see what happens'. As I began to spread it around, I realized that it was *way* too much product and figured I was doomed for an oily face that night. Cut to a few minutes later, when I was shocked to find that it had ***all*** absorbed. It dries down quickly to a soft, almost-matte finish. It legit gives my skin a healthy glow without making it oily, something that I didn't think was possible. The first time I wore it to work, I was ***incredibly*** impressed by the fact that my skin was still matte at the end of the day. My work's super dry air usually drives my dehydrated skin nuts and by the end of the day, it's over-produced a ton of oil to compensate. But not with this!! It gives my skin the hydration it always needs with just enough moisture to seal it all in. I am absolutely over-the-moon in love with this product and I can't recommend it enough! \n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Polysorbate 60, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Honey Extract, Ceramide Np, Sorbitan Stearate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Isohexadecane, Tromethamine, Hydroxyacetophenone, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Polysorbate 80, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitan Oleate, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Oil, Disodium EDTA, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Butylene Glycol, Bixa Orellana Seed Oil, Tocopherol.\n\n**The Saem Iceland Hydrating Soothing Gel -** The name pretty much says it all and it lives up to those claims. It's very hydrating, soothing and feels very refreshing. The fascinating thing about this product is how it dries down. It leaves an almost undetectable finish. I've never had anything disappear into my skin before - and I say that in the best way possible. It doesn't leave a tacky film the way most gels do. I use the Skinfood aloe gel daily (which does leave a bit of stickiness) and out of curiosity, I applied this on top of it. The combo dried down to almost nothing! It took away the stickiness all together. I am highly impressed with this gel! It is definitely a staple in my routine now and (*gasp*) may just replace my beloved Skinfood aloe (at least in the AM).\n\nIngredients: Water, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate 20, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Perfume, Sodium Acrylates Crosspolymer-2, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Disodium EDTA, Silica, Betaine, Heptane, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Propylene Glycol, Butylene glycol, Cetraria Islandica Extract, Sorbitol, Citric acid, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Prunus Mume Fruit Extract, Lactic acid.\n\n**Elisha Coy Refreshing Ampoule Solution Sheet Mask -** Another product that lives up to its name. I was nervous because these are on the cheaper side and usually the quality reflects that. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised! The mask itself fit very well. It's on the thinner side and it reminds me a lot of my fav sheet masks, the Etude House 0.2mm Air Therapy. It stayed in place and despite the essence being very watery, it didn't drip everywhere. The mask really seemed to hold onto the essence. After I took it off, I patted in the remaining essence from the pouch and it all absorbed completely. I was able to continue my routine with no issues. My skin was left hydrated, soothed and happy. \n\nIngredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Magnolia Kobus Bark Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Betula Alba Juice, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Chrysanthellum Indicum Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Fragrance.\n\nI haven’t had the chance yet to try the rest of the sheet masks yet but I am very excited to do so!! If anyone has any questions, I’m happy to help! :)\n",

Royal Jelly, however, does not have any evidence of helping skin a whole lot.*\n\n*Potentially problematic ingredients: The oils in this are great, but the high % olive oil may be bothersome to acne-prone skin types.

As others have said, the product's bottle isn't made to protect the product from light, so make sure to keep the product in a dark place. Based on the ingredients there is just the possible irritation from the orange oil (perfume). So you will either feel that it is irritating, or it is not - that depends on how sensitive your skin in.

    "body": "- Skin type - oily acne prone, sweaty face\n- Climatic conditions - hot & humid\n- Age - 22F\n- Usage timeline - one month \n- Routine in that duration - Himalaya neem purifying facewash > Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel > Nature's Tattva Rose water (twice a day)  \n- Ingredients list - Water, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Dimethicone/vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethanol, Polyacrylamide, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Dimethiconol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance,C12-14 Pareth-12, Sodium Hydroxide, Blue 1\n- Status - HG, WRP\n\n\n- Review & How I used it : \n\nSo this is the 15gm [mini version ](https://www.nykaa.com/neutrogena-hydro-boost-water-gel/p/875156?productId=875156&pps=1&skuId=875155) that I bought for Rs.370 \n\nMy face is very oily and sweaty. I used to use Neutrogena oil free moisturizer for combination skin before and it was quite decent but my face would feel sticky after a while and it's kinda uncomfortable. I tried Suganda white lotus moisturiser and it made my skin very sticky and oily within an hour. \nI tried Earth Rhythm phytogel and it was nice, decent like a light weight aloe Vera gel but not worth the price imo. So I was always on a hunt for a good gel type moisturiser that just didn't make me oily or feel tacky. \nI didn't want to spend 950 bucks to try this hydroboost moisturiser so I was always hesitant till one day I found a trial size available for 370 and decided to look past the fragrance and give it a go. \n\nThe first day I used it on dry skin after washing my face and it felt just okay and after a bit it started feeling tight and weird. I thought since it has Hyaluronic acid I should use it on damp skin. \n\nSo the next day I used it on damp skin and it felt way better but still it was just okay, nothing too crazy. Meh. \n\nThe third day I tried the moisture sandwich technique, something I've seen James Welsh do many times. \nSo I wash my face, wiped off the excess dripping water with my hand so that it's still damp, applied this moisturiser on my damp face and then sprayed rosewater on top of it. \nFelt quite crazy doing it the first time ngl but it was totally worth it. \nI didn't wash my face for the next 12 hours and I could not believe that my face was not oily at all. Maybe after 8-9 hours it was very slightly oily around my nose but it's nothing compared to how oily and greasy I would get within 2 hours after using other moisturiser. \nI observed the same results after doing this at night and waking up the next morning to a non greasy face. \nI also feel like with this moisturiser the way of application matters a lot and I only get this result when I apply in this way. \n\nThe small tub lasted me a month after using it twice a day everyday. It definitely lives up to all the claims made. \nMy skin feels healthy, supple and so balanced. I felt so happy when I randomly touched my face during the day and it was NOT tacky or greasy or matte even, just felt like normal healthy skin. \nIt does have fragrance but it does not bother me, I'm okay with it. \nIt did not break me out at all. \nI hate that I love this moisturiser so much and really want to save up to buy the big tub lol.",

My friends to found it's building up acne in them. We really thought of filing a case on this. We feel cheated, even the brand suggests that if ur doctor recommends it and u get side effects , remember it's because it's doing good on ur skin...this is the caption of the product..something like this. May I remind u all that this is johnson and johnson company who have absolutely no ethics nor science backedup . It's proven that their products do cause cancer.

This allergy is most common among manicurists and dental technicians because they are constantly exposed to acrylates.  It's one of the fastest growing allergies in the U.S.  Acrylates are also a proven carcinogen.  Your shampoo, conditioner, hair gel, skin moisturizer, make-up, nail polish, band-aids, glue, paint, surgical adhesives, acrylic fabric, dental adhesives, the adhesives used for TENS machines, the gel used for ultrasounds, tape,  almost all topical medications including Voltaren, hairspray, cosmetics, and printer ink all contain acrylates so they all contain a form of plastic.   If you are really trying to live plastic-free you need to cut out acrylates also, especially in their liquid or sticky form.  The easiest way to avoid acrylates in products is to look for things that are \"all natural\" and of course, read all the ingredients.  You can google the different names of acrylates but carbomer is also made with acrylates and that doesn't always get listed.\n\n[https://www.safecosmetics.org/chemicals/acrylates/](https://www.safecosmetics.org/chemicals/acrylates/)",

    "body": "This is my first review, so im not sure how this will go, but i absolutely love this product so much that it would be nice if more people knew about it.\n\nSkin type: extremely dry, acne prone,\n\nConcerns: hyperpigmentation, redness, dryness\n\nClimate: dry (Aus)\n\nPrice: I paid $22 usd for 2 serums, they were in some buy one get one free box deal on Global Oliveyoung. But now, i think it retails for around $20 usd each full price? But Olive young does have sales quite often. It's also 50ml.\n\nIngredients:\n\nPurified Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid (500 ppm), Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Trehalose, Betaine, Propanediol, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel) extract, Madecassoside, Madecassic Acid, Ceramide NP, Beta-Glucan, Malachite Extract, Cholesterol, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, PVM/MA Copolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Ethylhexylglycerin,Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract,Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, I don't know that much about ingredients.... sorry to those that are sensitive to EO's and fragrance etc. However, I do prefer products with no fragrance. And this product seems to be fragrance free.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReview:\n\nSo, i first heard about this product a while ago, when another redditor posted the hwahae ratings. I saw that this ranked so highly, it was like number 1 or 2? Something like that, I dont remember exactly, but it was defs in the top 5. I've never heard about this product from this sub before. I have seen a few korean youtubers use it before, but it really wasnt widely advertised or anything like that. But when I saw that oliveyoung had the 1+1 deal, I thought why not just try it out? Another thing, is that this serum contains panthenol, an my skin lovesss panthenol, and i find it to be alot more soothing and effective for my skin in comparison to centella products. (Maybe this is why i like this product so much? idk).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I am near the end of this product now, and can for say for sure that I absolutely love this so much. Not only is it moisturising, its also very effective in soothing my redness and acne. I think its hard for me to find a serum that does both so effectively at the same time. Another serum I really like for soothing is the Be Plain Cicaful Ampoule, but i find that not moisturising at all. It's nice that this serum is very effective in both moisturising and soothing. \n\nFurthermore, another effect i realised two weeks in, was that my skin felt so plump?? It's not a thing I usually care for/look out for/desire, but my skin was just so plump and bouncy and it wasnt like this in the past at all. I guess thats another plus of this product?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I love this serum so much, and especially at the price point and at 50ml, I think its quite a steal and I would definitely repurchase and recommend it to all skin types :-----)",

    "body": "I was on Sephora.com last week about to order some Kat Von D makeup removing wipes (I was hoping to find something that would take off waterproof everything and I recall the sample of hers doing the trick, as in being ridiculously oily.) when I came across something brand new: [Urban Decay's Makeup Removing Wipes](http://www.sephora.com/meltdown-makeup-remover-wipes-P409954?skuId=1850403&icid2=D=c6:products%20grid:p409954). I can literally not find these anywhere else, not a review, nothing. Or at least I couldn't prior to Friday. I was trying to find an ingredient list before ordering, but it was as though they did not exist other than the listing on Sephora.com to buy.  Since they were really reasonably priced (ETA: reasonable by Sephora standards.) and you get 100 wipes in the pack, I figured what the hell. I seem to have no self control when it comes to anything makeup related and just buy it like it's nothin'. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/b2kCl2Z\n\nThey arrived today and even though it's only 530 pm, and I really don't normally take my makeup off this early so as not to scare small children or offend their sensibilities (my niece has some pretty strong opinions about me going out without makeup on: she \"doesn't prefer it.\") I could not wait to test them out and see if they worked better than the [Aveeno ones](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod5600049)  (shit, yo, Ulta charges way more, get em at Target or Drugstore.com or something!) I'd been using or if they burned any less. (FYI--they still burn but not as badly, but I have ridiculously sensitive skin, plus retinoids. So, everything burns.) \n\n\n\n*Sizing, and about the wipe:*\n\nThe sheets themselves are bit smaller (6.5\" x 4.5\") than the Aveeno ones (7.4\" x7.2\" per the package, so a little over 7\" square), but compared to the Aveeno ones were slightly damper--not as wet as I would like though and not as wet as I recall the Aveeno ones being in the past--and certainly not as damp as the Simple Micellar Wipes are.  I've had several packs of Aveeno ones that have been really dry lately from the start, and dried out before the pack was even half done. \n\nThe wipes themselves are texturally similar. The Aveeno ones are slightly thicker, and stronger than the UD ones, but the UD ones are labeled as biodegradable. \n\nA used UD wipe:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/tcuMw6M\n\n\n\n*Efficacy/Usage:*\n\nI usually use one Aveeno wipe (out of a 25 wipe pack) at a time, and that will take off most or all of my waterproof eye makeup (yknow, assuming it is wet enough) and then will go over my whole face with one of the Simple Micellar wipes to make sure any oiliness is gone. There are still times where I don't get all of the eye makeup off, because I pile it on. Often what is left is mascara, and I either give up, or will go over my lashes with another wipe OR use one of the Ocusoft scrub pads to get it off. \n\nI felt due to the size of the Urban Decay wipes that I needed two. I probably didn't, but for the sake of comfort, I did use two. Given that 100 come in the pack, even if I use two at a time, I will still get twice as much out of this pack assuming it doesn't dry out before I run out.  I still used the Simple wipe afterward, because again, oily.  I did not really have anything left on my eyes or lashes afterwards, and didn't feel like I needed to go over my lashes or eyes at all. There might be a tiny bit of something still on there, but not enough that I feel like I need to worry about it. I'd go to bed like this.   Tonight I have boxing, so I will still shower, so I don't care--I'll be washing my face again.\n\nBefore/After photos, try not to have nightmares:\n\nB:  http://imgur.com/P4MOMdb\n\nB:  http://imgur.com/qmJiPAq\n\nA:  http://imgur.com/1BbCxIF\n\n\n\n*Pricing:*\n\nThe price difference is significant, but I felt worthwhile.  The Aveeno wipes are around $6.99 (at Target) for a pack of 25. The Urban Decay were $20 for a pack of 100. So basically to get as many Aveeno wipes as UD wipes, you'd pay $27.96 assuming you didn't find them on sale/coupon deal. Though, I guess considering you're using two UD wipes, it's really half that, so $13.98, given I need one Aveeno for every two UD wipes (need...maybe. Used, yes.) And again, that assumes the Aveeno ones are not dried out. \n\n\n\n*Ingredients:*\n\nI took a photo of the package, it's not great. \nhttp://imgur.com/Gqw4mWc\n\nList is:\n\nWater, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Ethyl Macadamiate, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Citrate, Gluconolactone, Polyglyceryl-3 Polyricinoleate, Sunflower Seed Oil, Sodium Benzoate, Olive Oil, Lavender Oil, Jojoba Seed Oil, Sodium Laurylglucosides Hydroxypropylsulfonate, Calcium Gluconate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Chloride, Rice Bran Extract, Tocopheryl, Malic Acid, Sunflower Extract, Rosemary Leaf Extract\n\n\nBut this product has five natural oils in it, vs none in the Aveeno.  Here's the list from Ulta on the Aveeno:\n\nWater, Isononyl Isononanoate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Isostearyl Palmitate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hexylene Glycol, PEG-6, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Phenoxyethanol, Sucrose Cocoate, Fragrance, Carbomer, PEG-4 Laurate, Sodium Hydroxide, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Chrysanthemum Parthenium(Feverfew) Flower/Leaf/Stem Juice, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Glycerin, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract.  The package says there's a 3 month shelf life, which I think given the ingredient list is interesting, though, it's heavy on the natural oils, and maybe they're less stable?  Compared to the Aveeno list, it's significantly more natural. \n\n\n\n*Bottom Line:*\n\nI am pretty impressed after one use. I will see how I feel after several more. I want to see if they dry out and how quickly they dry out if they do.   But efficacy in the first use made them worth my while. \n\nedited to correct stupid typo\n\n\n**24 hours later update:**\n\nI just did my second use today and I was able to use ONE wipe this time (well that was my requirement of myself this time), and it worked just fine, both eyes completely clean. I followed with the Simple Micellar wipe all over and briefly around my eyes, bec I am just that anal, and my face is spiffy.  Then I just applied my serums and all that after like normal.  *Fingers crossed* that my face doesn't lose it's marbles with all the natural oils. ",

    "body": "I was already skeptical when I bought it as an add-on, but I figured for $3 bucks it didn't hurt... Now I'm wondering if I should even put it on my face. \n\n\n1. There are basically no reviews anywhere outside of the official website. There's reviews on Nordstrom's, but they're all *reposted from the company's site*. The positive reviews didn't mention anything specific--\"Really pleasant serum and effects on the skin to suit.\" the few reviews seem fake as FUCK in my opinion. I found one more site that has reviews, but still, few reviews and a little generic. \n\n\n2. Packaging says it's **made in China**. Sorry, what the fuck?? A purportedly $350 cream is *made in China*? A company with very little info, very few reviews, making stuff in China? Alarm bells going off here, esp with regulation of ingredients. Not that China automatically means bad quality, but it's not a great sign for a no-name company. \n\n\n3. The **ingredients don't match the official site**. What the what?!\n\nHere's what the back of my sample said:\n\n\nWater, Sorbitol, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Bis - PEG - 18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Diazolidinyl Urea, Sodium PCA, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Hyaluronate, Disodium EDTA, Niacinimide, Panthenol, Carrageenan Extract, Propylene Glycol, Acrylic Acid Copolymer, PVM/MA Copolymer, Beta-Glucan, Chlorphenesin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Maltodextrin, BHT, Aesculus Hippocastanum Seed Extract, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Atecyl Cysteine, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Soybean Oil, Citric Acid, Calendula Officinalis Extract, Tocopherol, Fragrance. \n\nAnd here's the ingredients list from the official site:\n\n\nGLYCERIN, AQUA / WATER / EAU, SORBITOL, ISOPROPYL MYRISTATE, ALOE BARBADENSIS (ALOE VERA) EXTRACT, CALENDULA OFFICINALIS EXTRACT, ALCOHOL, CARBOMER, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, AESCULUS HIPPOCASTANUM (HORSE CHESTNUT / MARRON) SEED EXTRACT, SODIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE, ACETYL CYSTEINE, PANTHENOL, NIACINAMIDE, THIAMINE, RIBOFLAVIN, PYRIDOXINE, CYANOCOBALAMIN, DISODIUM EDTA, FRAGRANCE / PARFUM.\n\n\nCan anyone explain to me why the ingredients themselves would be different, and in the wrong order?? A lot of the ingredients not officially listed, like BHT and Diazolidinyl Urea, don't have great results on CosDNA.... And overall, I don't see any special ingredients beyond a few basic moisturizers, a bunch of preservatives, etc. Like, nothing that would make this worth $$$. \n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nHas anyone tried it? What are your results so far? I guess I'll still give it a try, but the fact that it's made in China (definitely potential ingredient contamination) and the ingredients aren't listed correctly makes me very skeptical... What's your take?\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/niANANe.jpg",

        "body": "This sounds like it might be a private label product, made by whoever in China and repackaged by a company that specifically sells/vends to beauty boxes. That there is no other information on this product online, it’s only appearance is in this beauty box, indicates a PLM product. Beauty box companies routinely pair with companies who private label their (inexpensively sourced) products and put a high price tag on it to make it seem like an amazing deal. \n\nSome people on this sub HATE any talk of private labeling in beauty boxes, they don’t want their bubble burst of how “great a deal!” their boxes and the products in them seem to be. Some brands seem to only exist in beauty boxes (Doucce, Laritzy, Starlooks, Micabeauty, The Beauty Crop, Be A Bombshell, Mirabella, etc). There are tons more, I’ve only subbed to Play and Allure lately so I’m a little behind. I suspect most or all of the brands I listed are private label. \n\nYou can usually tell because the brand’s presence is entirely online (outside of boxes) and the actual website will be a little “off.” A bit of a DIY template look. Real brands that manufacture their own products will usually sell in retail stores and have a custom website. Private label brands won’t because that shit costs money and they’re all about repackaging inexpensively-sourced products that another company made. \n\nIt’s a huge thing in the beauty industry right now. I’m not against private labeling, I just think a lot of people are being misled about “box values” with these inflated prices. Things are ultimately worth what you pay for them I guess but when someone posts how their “$20 box has a $300 value!” I roll my eyes a bit every time lol.\n\nSephora Play has had the fewest amount of PLM products in their boxes, which is why the samples are smaller and less varied-seeming. They seem to only have items in their boxes that they sell in their stores. Ipsy used to have a TON but they seem to send more higher-quality brands lately. Allure seems to be going down that road (Juvia’s Place, LASplash, etc). Most of the eye palettes in Boxycharm are from private label manufacturers, for example. Brands that just pop up out of nowhere in a beauty box, then just keep showing up in beauty boxes only. \n\nThis isn’t just true for beauty boxes though, it’s the case all across the entire beauty industry. I read somewhere that up to 80% or department store products are made by private label manufacturers. It’s just more obvious in beauty boxes because the same brands repeat over and over. When really, a good chunk of the products are made by the same larger companies and factories overseas, regardless of what brand name it says on the packaging. And the websites of beauty box brands seem more homemade and template-y.",

I hope it's okay to post about it again, since summer is very soon.\n\n\nI also kind of want more people to buy it. It feels sad that not many people know about it, when in my opinion it's really good. I have tried la Roche posay, nivea uv face, and I really think this one is better. But of course be careful and check the ingredient list!\n\n\nHere was my comment:\n\n\nI really like the asda sun cream which I have been using for 2 years now since discovering it one day - ASDA Protect SPF 50+ Face Q10 Anti-Age Sun Cream. I have the most sensitive skin, probably one of the most sensitive skin types you will ever meet due to my chronic eczema, and this one doesn't irritate me at all. To be honest, in the last year my eczema has been under control, and I was using this, so I can't say that it worsened my skin.\n\n\nIts only £2.40 so I think it's worth a try, and its UVA rating is very high- more than my nivea face uv sunscreen for £15ish (which burns my eyes). The only issue is that it's not matte. For me that's ok, as it covers my cracked and flaky skin. But you might want to try their matte version, which is the same price. If you want to try this one I am happy to take a picture/video of its consistency for you?\n\n\nHere are its ingredients:\nAqua, Octocrylene, Glycerin, Alcohol Denat., C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Titanium Dioxide (Nano), Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Tapioca Starch, Coco-Caprylate, Undecane, Tocopheryl Acetate, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Silica, Panthenol, Caprylyl Glycol, Parfum, Tridecane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Xanthan Gum, Dimethicone, Disodium EDTA, Ubiquinone, Sodium Hydroxide, Carbomer, Benzyl Alcohol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Citronellol, Limonene, Tocopherol, Linalool, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil\n\n\n\nI hope this helps, and good luck.",

I definitely wouldn't moisturize then apply this, the SPF is all I need. \n\nI have notoriously sensitive eyes so admittedly I haven't tried it in that area yet as I had to go out and didn't want to risk burning eyes so I used my usual SPF (the bondi sands one) and then applied the ASDA one everywhere else and I've had no issues. \n\nI will be trying it around the eyes tomorrow though as I'm not going anywhere. You may have just saved me a lot of future money OP so thanks! Even if it doesn't work around the eyes I can at least apply it to the rest of the face and use my usual in that area meaning it will last longer so its win/win really.\n\nUPDATE: So I've now tried it around the eyes and it felt fine for the first couple of hours, however after that I did experience some very mild burning in the eye area. Having said that, when I say \"very mild\" I mean really, really mild. If I was out and about I probably wouldn't even notice it as it only lasted a couple of minutes and then stopped. \n\nI would still class this as a success. Mild for me is still an improvement over most SPF's I've tried since my eyes are so sensitive. I will continue to use this and possibly just use my usual SPF around my eyes and the ASDA one on the rest of my face. Which will make my more expensive one last a lot longer since its only going to be used in the eye area.",

    "body": "Hey ScA! I recently lapsed on my skincare routine, so I decided that I should do a review of my main products as I add them back into my routine. This review will be mainly overall experience, with some recent insights. I have more products that I have used in the past, but I decided to only review ones I have a lot of experience with so far. The only product I don't have reviewed from my routine is the Advanced Retinoid - as I just reintroduced that back into my routine in the last week.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**My current routine:**\n\n*AM*\n\n1.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n2.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n3.\tTO Niacinamide over whole face\n4.\tApply TO Caffeine to under eye\n5.\tFormula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free moisturizer over whole face\n6.\tIf using sunscreen, use Etude House Sunprise\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*PM*\n\n1.\tIf wearing makeup, I use baby oil to remove\n2.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n3.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n4.\tPaula’s Choice 2% BHA Gel to whole face – wait ~20 mins to sink in\n5.\tTO Retinoid Advanced Retinoid 2% over whole face\n6.\tMoisturize with Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Info about my skin/general experience trying out products:**\n\n* VERY oily t-zone, normal cheeks, normal-to-dry jaw line and around mouth; light-to-medium skin tone\n* VERY VERY CC-prone, mainly on my forehead (some on chin). This is mainly due to not being consistent with my routine (especially simply washing my face with a cleanser, which is the minimum I need). This can also occur from moisturizer.\n* No issues with acne, except a few whiteheads around my menstrual cycle\n* Most cleansers I have tried are either a) not strong enough or b) too strong\n* Main skin concerns: Oil control, reducing appearance of giant nose pores, preventing CCs, even skin tone, healthy aging\n* Slowly trying to reduce the number of products I use for all the things (not just skin care) that contain fragrances\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser](https://imgur.com/a/uAvebDj)\n\n***Product Type:*** Cleanser; specifically purchased because it is **sulfate free** (my body hates sulfates)\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Juice, Coco-Betaine, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Peg-50 Shea Butter, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Lycium Barbarum Fruit Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Morinda Citrifolia Fruit Extract, Punica Granatum Juice Extract, Garcinia Mangostana Fruit Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Benzoic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Red 33\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance free**; **Sulfate free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; AM: use with konjac sponge; Fragrance is actually pleasant, doesn’t linger; consistency starts off creamy, but foams very easily\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is amazing, and has been a major game-changer for me when it comes to cleansers. I’ve never found a cleanser that worked long-term before this one. A little goes a long way with this stuff – it is a very efficient clean. My face feels so soft afterwards. While it is strong enough to get rid of all my oil, it’s not so harsh that it makes my skin tight.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** In terms of function, none that I can think of. Only downfall (IMO) is it is not fragrance-free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4.5/5 stars, I’ve gone through over 4-5 bottles of this stuff and I will keep it in rotation until I can find a functionally similar product that is fragrance-free\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Thayer’s Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner](https://imgur.com/a/OwCREGs)\n\n***Product Type:*** Toner; purchased because of how many people liked it on ScA\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~0.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Purified Water, Certified Organic Witch Hazel Ext Blend (Hamamelis Virginiana Extract (Witch Hazel*), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (Filet of Aloe Vera*)), Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Water, Fragrance (Natural Rose), Citric Acid, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Seed Extract\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** ***Not fragrance-free***; Liquid consistency; potentially irritating, depending on your skins relationship with witch hazel\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Despite the smell (see below), this stuff works pretty well. I always feel like this enhances my *clean* feel following my cleanse, but it also leaves my skin feeling refreshed and moisturized. I always follow-up with moisturizer, but I can definitely tell when I don’t use it, especially in my dry areas.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** **I HATE THE SMELL OF THIS STUFF!** Come to find out, I hate the smell of roses (I’m weird, I know…) but seriously. This stuff smells like a rose pooped in some water and then sold it on the side of the road on a hot sunny day. It’s terrible. If you are remotely disinterested in the smell of rose, do not buy this.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5 due to smell. Will repurchase the fragrance-free version in the future\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%](https://imgur.com/a/Tuo5otO)\n\n***Product Type:*** Purchased to reduce redness/even skin tone and to control oil; side-benefits: helps prevent CCs\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mild medicinal smell**, doesn’t linger; Somewhat-sticky consistency; Absorbs quickly\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** I keep this in rotation mainly because it helps control my oil. Even if I use this stuff without my mattifying moisturizer, it helps prevent the massive amounts of oil that my skin normally produces. It helps keep my skin an even texture and tone, as well. I’m not 100% sure if this is solely responsible for preventing my CC (doubt it, since I use BHA), but I’m almost certain it’s contributing at the least. This product has been one that I have been most consistent with besides my cleanser and what little redness I sometimes develop (mainly due to allergies or weather) has been under control.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Functionally, none. This stuff does what it’s supposed to. I just hate the dropper packaging, personally, of most TO products. It’s hard to get the little bits out of the bottom!!\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, have repurchased 2+ times; will be replacing with skinlex’s version to avoid buying more products from Deciem.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG](https://imgur.com/a/roT93Vy)\n\n***Product Type:*** Active for reducing appearance of eye contour pigmentation\n\n***Cost:*** **$* - ~$7.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Caffeine, Maltodextrin, Glycerin, Propanediol, Epigallocatechin Gallatyl Glucoside, Gallyl Glucoside, Hyaluronic Acid, Oxidized Glutathione, Melanin, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Urea, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Xanthan gum, Lactic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Propyl Gallate, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Benzyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; Watery-to-thick consistency (from the glycerin, probably); no noticeable smell; yellow-ish in color\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I’ve been using this stuff for a little over a year, and honestly it does absolutely nothing for my eye contour. I don’t have much puffiness, but I do have decent enough under eye darkness where I wanted something to help. This does not. It does help reduce the appearance with some small, visible blood vessels around my nose, but it’s only a temporary effect thereby reducing redness. \n\n***Bad stuff:*** It doesn’t really work for what I wanted it to work for.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 1/5, WNRP.\n\n*Does anyone have any suggestions of what I can do with what I have leftover? I’d love to use it for something else if it’s functional!*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free Mattifying Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/rQeCSUV)\n\n***Product Type:*** Daytime moisturizer; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Propylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethicone, Ceteareth-20, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Silica Silylate, Behenyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Salicylic Acid, Panthenol, Fragrance, Boron Nitride, Bambusa Arundinacea (Bamboo) Stem Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Maltodextrin, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance-free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; very thick consistency; absorbs quickly; powdery/soft finish\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** Another game-changer with my oily skin. Using this moisturizer during the day saves my face from producing oil. Even if I sweat a little bit, it controls oil. Normally, without it, I’ll start producing oil within a few hours of cleansing. If I use this moisturizer, I’m relatively oil-free all day, except around my nostrils. This is also a strong enough moisturizer to keep my dryness at bay, even during the wintertime (and where I live gets very cold during the winter).\n\n***Bad stuff:*** The smell is pretty bad (probably the bamboo), but honestly I get used to it and the smell goes away quickly. My friend said it smells like wet dog... haha but I don't notice it anymore since I've been using it for so long.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, only because it’s not fragrance-free. Will continue to repurchase until I can find a fragrance-free alternative.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Sun Milk SPF50+/PA+++](https://imgur.com/a/kXZLXCa)\n\n***Product Type:*** Sunscreen; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.40 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dipropylene Glycol, Titanium Dioxide, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Viscum Album (Mistletoe) Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Carex Humillis Root Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Pinus Sylvestris Leaf Oil, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Malpighia Emarginata (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Echium Plantagineum Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Peg-10 Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Magnesium Sulfate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Methicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Aluminum Hydroxide, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Octyldodecanol, Dimethicone, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-6 Polyricinoleate, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Butylene Glycol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Cellulose Gum\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mineral sunscreen**; **Not fragrance-free**; **Mild whitecast**, but absorbs well; **Drying**; mattifying/oil-control like a boss; pleasant scent; not waterproof\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Due to drying my skin out, I only use this product when I have to. I don’t wear SPF most days (work inside, very little exposure to sun during the day), but I do wear this when I’m running errands and/or trying to control my oil more than I can with the moisturizer mentioned previously. This stuff works really well to control oil – the best of any product I’ve tried so far. Wears well under makeup, as long as my dry skin is kept controlled. Some minor white cast, but with my skin it absorbs and isn’t visible (even when I’m tanner) – but may not be the same on someone with a darker than medium skin tone.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** This product is very drying. It works SO WELL on controlling oil, but it zaps any amount of moisture out of my dry spots. To the point where I have to counteract the dryness in my PM routine. Do not recommend for people with sensitive skin, or dry skin.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 3/5, due to drying and not being fragrance-free; Will continue to repurchase until I find an alternative that controls my oil as well as this does, if ever.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Paula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Gel Exfoliant](https://imgur.com/a/X9YEexN)\n\n***Product Type:*** Chemical exfoliant; meant to prevent/reduce CCs and help with overall skin texture\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$8.80 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, (hydration), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Phytosphingosine (skin-renewing), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Vitis Vinifera Seed Extract (grape extract/antioxidant), Camellia Sinensis Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (green tea/antioxidant) Epilobium Angustifolium Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (willow herb/skin-soothing), Bisabolol (skin-soothing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH-adjusting), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; **BHA**; thick consistency, absorbs slowly\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is AMAZING! It attacks any signs of CCs overnight, and can easily clear my CC-prone forehead within a day or two. I use it almost every day as a preventative. My face has been noticeably clearer and smoother thanks to this product. Also, it visibly reduces the appearances of pores - this combined with the retinol I use has been an amazing in reducing their appearance.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Smells chemical, so may be off-putting to some people. Absorbs slowly, so you should leave room in your routine for that.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, WRP. I am going to be trying to the liquid version (I got it on sale), but if this works better for me over the liquid I will come back to it\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/BDGVfpd)\n\n***Product Type:*** PM moisturizer; light-weight\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$9.50 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Dimethicone/vinyl Dimenticone Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethaqnol, Polyacrylamide, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Dimethiconol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, C12-14 Pareth -12, Sodium Hydroxide, Blue 1\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **NOT Fragrance-free**; **Contains silicones**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; **Contains hyaluronic acid**; Very light-weight moisturizer.\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I love this product. It was the first moisturizer I tried when I embarked on my skincare journey, and I am so thankful I found it. This is the first moisturizer I used every in my life that didn’t break me out or lead to a forehead full of CCs. I’m in love with this stuff! It is light enough for my super oily spots (which is not due to being dry, it’s just oily…) and is strong enough for my dry spots. In the winter I use a little extra HA serum over my whole face and it works like a charm. I’ve been dabbling with some oils as well, but so far I haven’t found it necessary in the summer because this moisturizer works so well!\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Nothing, just that it’s not fragrance free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, because of fragrance. Will continue to RP until I can find an alternative that I can afford and is fragrance free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading, everyone! I hope this is helpful, as I use some products that you don't see a lot around here (as well as some you do...). This is definitely a more simplified version of my routine, but that may be a good thing, as I'm noticing the same effects as to what I was seeing before despite reducing the number of products I use!",

    "body": "Hiya,\n\nI hope you enjoy the below reviews. I'm just a regular consumer buying everything with my own money - i.e., nothing sponsored, etc. Note, I've bought all of them on sale for around AUD$15-20 because I like sales haha.\n\nProducts:\n\n1. PKY - essence toner;\n2. PKY - mist toner;\n3. Secret Key - fresh nature toner - milk brightening one;\n4. Benton - Aloe BHA Toner;\n5. Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner; and\n6. Purito - Centella Green Level Calming Toner & the unscented version (Purito Unscented Centella Toner)\n\nMy skin used to be severely dry but is now slightly dry on the cheek areas and slightly oily on the t-zone during summer and slightly dry on the whole face in the winter.\n\nAlso note that the below two PKY products have different 'actives'/hero ingredients notwithstanding them seemingly being quite similar! I've bolded the plant extracts under the ingredient headers below.\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Essence Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495), Australian websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. *Note, this one is generally recommended for people with drier skin whereas the mist version is generally recommended for those with oilier skin* Friends with eczema have also used this with success. *.* I can use both year round without breaking out. I've had friends with oilier skin who've used this one and have broken out. YMMV.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** LOVE THIS. May repurchase this for the rest of my life. I've used this after breaking my moisture barrier, after chemical peels, after active masks, and also *after getting my face ablatively lasered (after the the initial few days of only using an ointment)*. It's REALLY benign in a godly way. If you want it to do anything other than hydrate or increase the penetration of your other actives, this isn't the product for you (note, it doesn't claim to do anything else apart from hydrate & calm really).\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a little bit thicker than water but not as thick as the Purito centella toners. Won't run off your hand/face like water will but will eventually run off.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** None at allll, even when I broke my moisture barrier.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? Yes**/I have rebought this 4 or so times so far.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Mist Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance. This is in a spray bottle and is better suited to oily skinned persons.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1060395517?cpid=1060395516&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1060395517%3Fcpid%3D1060395516%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=876677637398885328), and Australian websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/pyunkang-mist-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. This one is more for people with slightly oilier skin too. It's a lighter formula than the essence one.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Decent hydration, I prefer to use this in the toner stage instead of after my skincare but I have enjoyed using it as a 'refreshing' spray during the day.\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a nice mist, doesn't run on the face. Feels like a spray of water?\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a spray bit on top. I've had no issues with it but one mate had a couple that didn't spray properly.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** Unsure. I've rebought it once but haven't gone to use this one as much as I have the PKY essence toner or the Purito Unscented Centella Toner. I also don't like mists a whole bunch as they can go onto your clothes (if you're out) or jewellery if you're wearing any. But, I did go through a phase of keeping it in my handbag and using it when out and about for a bit of hydration.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Coptis Japonica Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Secret Key - Fresh nature Toner (Milk Brightening)**\n\n**What is it:** Hydrating toner that's meant to brighten your skin.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx.

Couldn't use it long enough to notice anything.\n\n**Smell:** A very strong scent that I could barely use it. I think I used it around 5-10 times before binning it - I couldn't even put up with the scent of this to use it on other parts of my body.\n\n**Feel:** really watery.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Fortunately (given the high fragrance), no reactions to this. If you had any irritation though, I'd expect some sort of reaction.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?

AUD$23.

I've not noticed any calming effects. It is definitely hydrating but given it's advertised as a BHA toner I'm quite disappointed at the lack of BHA efficacy here. I would much rather use the purito centella toner to hydrate and calm my skin as the centella has other benefits such as helping to stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** Similar to the PKY essence toner. Not as thick as the purito centella toners.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a pump on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **No**, almost threw it out but am trying to use it up.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nAloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Water (80%), Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Beta-Glucan, Polyglutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea (Green Purslane) Extract, Psidium Guajava (Guava) Fruit Extract, Salicylic Acid (0.5%), Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract (200mg), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice (200mg), Arginine, Pentylene Glycol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Polysorbate 20, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**E**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804)**tude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 relief toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$25 for 180mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/etude-house-soon-jung-ph-5-5-relief-toner-180ml-180ml/info.html/pid.1058586258), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone. It adds light hydration with benign ingredients - akin to the PKY toners but very minimally more expensive. It'd be good if you have irritated and/or dry skin.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** I used it once/twice a day until I used it up. Bought it in December 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Pretty decent. I'd recommend this to the same group of people who'd use the PKY essence toner. Nothing ground breaking. I prefer the calming nature of the Purito Unscented Centella Toner or even the PKY essence toner if you want zero actives (if you consider centella an 'active').\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** A watery toner.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** No but for no fault of the product. I just prefer using the Purito Unscented Centella one as it's just as benign, a bit cheaper, and has the benefits of centella.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, Propanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Madecassoside, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Polyglycerin-3, Disodium EDTA\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**Centella Green Level Calming Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804) **& the** [**Centella Unscented Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380)\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating and calming toner - may also stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$30 but I've always bought it on sale for approx. AUD$20-25 for 200mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380), [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml)\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone however this is best suited to those with any sort of irritation, acne, or redness. That is, if you have basically perfect skin you're probably not going to notice much of a difference but if you have irritation etc then you'll likely fall in love. Also good if you're wanting to help stimulate collagen production especially for the low price point - target ages for this is probably mid twenties and up.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** religiously since April 2020, sometimes twice a day.\n\n**My thoughts:** *BLOODY EXCELLENT*. I'm on my second bottle of this. My first bottle was the first listed one (scented) and then they released the unscented one so I bought that! It's incredible. I love it. In my opinion, it's partially why my skin is able to tolerate me using actives so much. It's excellent to use before actives as it doesn't interact with anything and really good to use after an 'active' mask or a clay mask etc. I switched to the unscented one to just reduce the risk of irritation.\n\n*also studies, which I haven't read but have seen derms I trust on insta etc, say that* ***centella can help stimulate/produce collagen... a big yes from me given it's a calming ingredient that shouldn't purge you or break you out*** *(unless you're allergic/sensitive to it)!*\n\n**Smell:** The scented one smells herbaceous (akin to Asian herbal medicine - I don't mind it but others may). The unscented one doesn't really smell like anything / I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** thick/fat/heavy water. Not a watery toner. Enjoyable.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Neverrrrrr, this helps me reduce the side effects from using actives such as retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, etc.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **Yes** & I have. Will probably rebuy for life.\n\n**Ingredients:** 4 variants as they've got the scented and unscented versions, and then those with and without witch hazel\n\nnon-witch hazel unscented version -\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract (strengthens skin barrier), Butylene Glycol (humectants), Pentylene Glycol (skin-conditioning agents), Dipropylene Glycol (humectants), 1,2-Hexanediol (stabilizers), Trehalose (humectants), Sodium Hyaluronate (natural moisturizing factor/ humectants), Hamemelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiaticoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiatic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Madecassic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Panthenol (strengthens skin barrier), Carbomer (viscosity increasing agents), Allantoin (skin protectants), Arginine (skin-conditioning agents), Portulaca Oleracea Extract (skin-conditioning agents), Ethylhexylglycerin (skin-conditioning agents), Disodium EDTA (stabilizers)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope these reviews were useful & feel free to ask any questions / start any discussions :)",

    "body": "So I recently read [this](https://simpleskincarescience.com/urea-for-skin/) blogpost detailing the benefits of urea. And they sound pretty all-around *amazing*. \n\nExcerpt from the blog about urea: \n> Urea is mainly known and used in dermatology for its keratolytic and hydrating properties. In other words, it hits the skin with a double whammy combo by both gently **exfoliating and moisturizing at the same time**. \n\n> Urea is part of the natural moisturizing factor (NMF) of skin, which is made up of 40% amino acids, 12% sodium PCA, 9% glycerol, and 8.5% urea (among other things). (3) These are all hygroscopic (water-holding) substances, that are essential for maintaining the health, function, and hydration of the stratum corneum. (4) \n\n>What’s super awesome about urea is that it works on both an external and cellular level! In other words, when applied to skin is decreases TEWL like most other moisturizers and whatnot, but it has an extended effect on the inner workings of skin. \n\n\n\nBut I've never really heard of urea on this sub, and that's what made me curious. Are there any urea creams in AB? For example, I happened across Cerave's new psoriasis cream with the second ingredient as urea:\n\n> **Active Ingredient:** Salicylic acid 2%\n**Inactive Ingredients:** Water, **urea**, glyceryl stearate SE, cetearyl alcohol, butyrosperum parkii (shea) butter, glycerin, cetearyl alcohol, **niacinamide**, laureth-9, limnanthes alba (meadowfoam) seed oil, PEG-100 stearate, gossypium herbaceum (cotton) seed oil, behentrimonium methosulfate, 1, 2-hexanediol, C12-13 alkyl lactate, dimethicone, tasmannia lanceolata fruit/leaf extract, **ceramid 3, ceramide 6-II, ceramide 1**, phytosphingosine, cholesterol, tocopherol, hydroxyacetophenone, hydrogenated olive oil, glyceryl stearate, disodium EDTA, sodium lauryl lactylate, xantham gum ,carbomer, **sodium hyaluonate**, sodium hydroxide \n\nBut that's pretty much the only urea based cream I've really seen around me... (I caved and slathered it on as a guinnea pig so we'll see how it goes). Have any of you tried an AB urea cream though? (including the hada labo mentioned in the post)  Or heard of one? If so, what were your experiences? \n\n",

    "body": "*Moisturisers seem to be the most boring and ignored category in a skincare regime but I have learnt over the years that they actually play the most important role. Sometimes actives are not what your skin is looking for and a good moisturiser can be the game-changer.*\n\n[Just a pic](https://preview.redd.it/p39fzjc4kx661.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=027cc219d95e8947525507a3beec33a9d459f961)\n\nBefore I review the products, these are my expectations from my moisturiser.\n\n1. ***Hydrate:*** Bring water/moisture to my skin\n2. ***Emolliate:*** Thanks to kindofstephen (google his blog or insta if you haven't) for providing a term to my feelings. Make my skin soft and supple by nourishing my stratum corneum with nourishing lipids without clogging my pores.\n3. ***Strengthen my barrier:*** To reduce TEWL by strengthening my barrier so that my skin stays hydrated and supple for longer. This also means I want the moisturiser to have slight occlusive properties.\n4. ***Repair:*** To help my damaged/sensitised skin by repairing my skin barrier.\n5. ***Extras/added benefits:*** Would like if the moisturiser additionally helps to deliver certain ingredients that help with targetted issues like ageing, hyperpigmentation etc. This is not a must though.\n\n\\---\n\n***1. Avene Skin Recover Cream -*** ₹*1500 (depends on discounts); Cost Per gm: ₹30/gm*\n\nThis is my go-to skin-emergency product. I do not use it on daily basis. The texture is cloudlike but not mousse-y. It is a lightweight cream. Nevertheless, it packs a punch. I have gone through 8+ tubes of this stuff. It is the only cream that does not aggravate any sensitised areas (burning/redness/dry patches/peeling patches) and absolutely calms my skin. This cream is true to its name. Repairs compromised flaking, sensitised skin in two days with twice/thrice a day usage. The ingredient list is very minimalistic. It is expensive and the sterile patented packaging kind of sucks because you will most definitely have face squirts if you are not careful. However, I can rely on this cream to fix my skin mistakes.\n\n* Hydrate: 4/5\n* Emmoliate: 4/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 4.5/5\n* Extras: 0/5\n* Status: HG, It is easily available in India but shit is expensive.\n\n***Perfect for: All skin types, Sensitive skin***\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene Aqua), Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Squalane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Serine, Carbomer, Tetrasodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, Water (Aqua)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***2. Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream -*** *$10/* ₹*1300 (with shipping/customs); Cost per gm* ₹6.5/gm\n\nI tried this product a month back and I am in love. This cream is perfectly balanced. It adequately hydrates and emolliates my skin. My skin feels supple and bouncy without being too greasy and the moisture lasts. I did not see noticeable calming benefits but as a moisturiser it is lovely. The tube is huge and a little goes a long way. This has a slight cooling effect when applied to the skin. Also uses a patented encapsulation delivery mechanism to delivery pseudo-ceramides (lab-made) which help to strengthen your skin barrier. In short, it is a simple no frill moisturiser that is easy to use - not too thick, not too thin, not too heavy, not too light, doesn't sensitize, not too silicone-y, doesn't pill, value for money.\n\n* Hydrate: 4/5\n* Emmoliate: 4/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 3.5/5\n* Extras: 0/5\n* Status: will repurchase.\n\n***Perfect for: All skin types***\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Stearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Palmitic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide Mea, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Magnolia Biondii Flower Extract, Cholesterol, Perilla Ocymoides Seed Extract, Lactobacillus/​Soybean Ferment Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohols, Glyceryl Caprylate, Dimethiconol, Mannitol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Silica, Arachidyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Alcohol, Acrylates/​Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polysorbate 20, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Propanediol*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***3. Eucerin Q10 Anti Wrinkle Face Cream -*** *$9*\n\nThis is my third tub of this cream. This cream is richer than any cream in the lot. It has a thick emollient texture without being too greasy. It absorbs easily in the skin. It also contains shea butter, SAP and Ubiquinone (Q10). This cream has helped me transition into tretinoin. Do not recommend it for day time use (especially in summers) but for night time/winters it is perfect. It keeps my face moisturised through the night and it has a soft blurring effect on fine lines/skin texture. It did not sensitize peeling skin but helped repair my barrier. I use this regularly at night and it helped to fix the acute dryness that comes with tretinoin. I use it around my eyes and it hasn't given me milia/ clogged my pores. My mom loves and swears by it. She finds it makes her wrinkles look softer.\n\n* Hydrate: 3.5/5\n* Emmoliate: 4.5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 4/5\n* Extras: 3/5\n* Status: HG but not readily available in India.

Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume -*** ₹*1300 (with shipping/customs); Cost per gm* ₹6.5/gm\n\nThis cream is unique. As the name suggests it is a cream-balm hybrid but the texture is surprisingly lightweight. Highly emollient with occlusive properties. It absorbs quickly into the skin as the texture is not too heavy. Sadly, it leaves a greasy feeling/film on my skin. I can not use it the day time and worry that it will clog my pores if I use it on my face. I love it for the body especially my Sahara hands. It seriously brings life to my hands and I do not need to reapply often. I did notice a calming effect. Many of my friends from the community love to use it on their face. It is a little too heavy for my face. If your face is very dry, I think you may like this.\n\n* Hydrate: 3/5\n* Emmoliate: 5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 3.5/5\n* Extras: 0\n* Status: WNRP at least for my face.\n\n***Perfect for:***  *Extremely Dry Skin*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Aqua/​Water/​Eau, Glycerin, Paraffinum Liquidum /​ Mineral Oil /​ Huile Minerale, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Behenyl Alcohol, Sucrose Stearate, Canola /​ Canola Oil /​ Huile De Colza, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Pentylene Glycol, Beta-Sitosterol, Xylitol, Zinc Gluconate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Palmitamide Mea, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Rhamnose, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 60, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Phytosphingosine, Ceramide Np, Mannitol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide Ap, Cholesterol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Ceramide EOP*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***5. Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream -*** ₹2700 *(estimated); Cost per gm* ₹45/gm\n\nI was sort of disappointed with this product. It is not a bad product but it is not necessarily better. The soft blue colour deceives your mind to think the cream texture may be light. It is actually slightly thick with a silicone-y feel. It has a cooling effect on the skin when you first apply it which tricks the calming feeling. While it is hydrating when you first apply it but compared to others I feel the moisture does not last as long. Also, it makes the sensitised area skin sort of burn. The feeling is not intense but very much against claims. I did not notice any calming/repairing benefits. It may also not be enough moisturisation for the winters. The colour is aesthetically pleasing and silicone-y texture + cooling feel can outwit you into enjoying application but I do not see many real benefits.\n\n* Hydrate: 3/5\n* Emmoliate: 2.5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 3/5\n* Repair: 3/5\n* Extras: 1?\n* Status: WNRP, Expensive.\n\n***Perfect for:***  *Oily/ Combo Dehydrated Skin?*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Centella Asiatica Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Glyceryl Stearate, Stearic Acid, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Polysorbate 60, Bees Wax, Chlorphenesin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Morus Alba Root Extract, Tromethamine, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Guaiazulene, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Lecithin, Acetyl Glutamine, SH-Oligopeptide-1, SH-Oligopeptide-2, SH-Polypeptide-1, SH-Polypeptide-9, SH-Polypeptide-11, Bacillus/​Soybean/​Folic Acid Ferment Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol*\n\n&#x200B;",

    "body": "I'm From wash off masks are well-loved in the Asian Beauty community. So I've been trying a few of these out and wanted to let you all know my experiences with them! The Fig Scrub Mask is a new product I received as a beauty tester for Wishtrend. Would have preferred getting the essence or cleansing balm instead, but hey! A free product's a free product.\n\n**I'm From Honey Mask**\n\n*Ingredients:*\n\n>Honey, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Pentylene Glycol, Microcrystalline Wax, Polysorbate 20, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Beeswax, Tocopheryl Acetate, Argania Spinosa Kernel Extract, Corylus Avellana (Hazel) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Water, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Propolis Extract, Beta-Glucan, Bee Venom, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Sophora Angustifolia Root Extract, Eugenia Caryophyllus (Clove) Flower Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Punica Granatum Fruit Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin\n\n*Overview:*\n\n- Looks and feels like a thick, gooey caramel sauce. Smells sweet since there's a lot of honey in this, but it's notably a medicinal type of honey scent. If you've ever smelled manuka honey this scent is within that general ballpark.\n- May separate occasionally. All you have to do is stir and it's good to go.\n- Pretty much never dries down. They recommend leaving it on for 10-60 minutes. Dry people would probably benefit more from leaving it on longer, but 60 minutes is overkill. I just do 30 minutes.\n- My first time washing this off, I had removed most of it with a wet paper towel (to save my clog prone sink) but thought it was strange that everything hadn't been taken off yet no matter how much I rinsed. Then I realized - no, that wasn't the mask. Or any residue. That plump, bouncy thing I was touching was just MY FACE. This mask just seems to max out your moisture levels like mad.\n- I think most people would really enjoy the Honey Mask. Dry and dehydrated skin types would especially love it. People who are oily and already have enough moisture may find it doesn't do much for them, though.\n\n**I'm From Mugwort Mask**\n\n*Ingredients:*\n\n>Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cordyceps Sinensis Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Methylpropanediol, Ligularia Fishceri Leaf Extract, Rosa Davurica Bud Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Sodium Polyacrylaste, Carbomer, Arginine, Phenoxyethanol, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Panthenol, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA\n\n*Overview:*\n\n- A clearish brown gel with bits of real mugwort. This is not supposed to be an exfoliating mask so be careful and don't rub those pieces in too much.\n- Kinda looks like you've rubbed dirt all over your face. Not necessarily a bad thing.\n- There's a distinctive scent. I've never specifically encountered mugwort before delving into K-beauty, but opening this immediately reminded me of the smell from Chinese traditional herbal stores. This smell isn't overwhelmingly strong but it is present. People who dislike those kinds of earthy scents will probably hate this.\n- Actually dries down. About 10-15 minutes depending on how thin of a layer you put on.\n- In contrast to the honey mask which excels at nourishing and plumping out your skin, the mugwort masks excels at reducing redness and calming irritation. It also made my face look a bit brighter.\n- It's not a moisture bomb like the honey mask. But it's enough to keep my skin decently hydrated and in a pretty good state.\n- This mask is pretty lightweight. Pretty much anyone can use this. Rather than a question of \"do you want a product for your skin type\", it's more of a question of \"do you have irritated skin and want a product targeted towards calming it down?\" The Mugwort Mask definitely delivers in this regard.\n\n**I'm From Fig Scrub Mask**\n\n*Ingredients:*\n\n>Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sucrose, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate , Stearalkonium Hectorite, C13-15 Alkane, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Powder, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Seed Meal, Fragrance(Parfum), Juglans Regia (Walnut) Shell Powder, Caprylyl Glycol, Caramel\n\n*Overview:*\n\n- Since this is a new product many people haven't seen yet, [here's some pictures!](https://imgur.com/a/Yh4QBfs)\n- Disclaimer: I'm not someone who usually uses scrubs on my face. So I can't really compare it to other products of this type.\n- The Honey Mask is gooey. The Mugwort Mask is a gel. I would the describe the Fig Scrub Mask as chunky.\n- This is an exfoliating wash off mask primarily made of sugar and fig powder. It has tiny 1mm wide nut pieces which are either the sweet almond or walnut shell listed in the ingredients. \n- There's a light fruit scent. Presumably this is what fig smells like, but can't confirm as I've never actually eaten fig. As Kelly Driscoll mentioned with the Ginseng line - if an I'm From product has a fragrant component it might just be included to amplify whatever scent's already in there. It doesn't seem to be an artificial fruit scent. Still find it unnecessary and would have preferred this product to have no fragrance at all. It's an exfoliating mask so what's the point?\n- The instructions say to leave it on for 10-15 minutes and then gently rub for a few more minutes. It doesn't say whether you're supposed to put it on wet or dry skin. I assume the wait time is for softening dead skin cells, so dry skin is probably the way to go.\n- As with all physical exfoliants - the end result will mainly depend on the user. Contrary to the name, you shouldn't actually scrub your face with this like you would scrub burnt bits off a pan. Please be gentle when massaging this in.\n- Could feel the mask warming up with the heat of my face and becoming a little more pliable. Not all the sugar's going to dissolve. Don't wait for that to be an indication of when you should stop rubbing. Just lightly glide with circular motions a couple times and wash it off.\n- My first time using this, there were flakes around my mouth (maybe from not massaging there enough) and a puffy red patch on my cheek (maybe from massaging there a little too much). So it's important to be thorough, but it's even more important to be gentle.\n- This leaves a similar moisturized feeling to the Honey Mask but to a lesser degree. My face feels smooth after.\n\n**Some further comments:**\n\n- The Honey and Mugwort Masks are available in sample size tubes. So try those out before buying the full size. Good for 5-6 uses.\n- Nobody else mentioned this, but all I'm From wash off masks come with a handy spatula.\n- The Fig Scrub Mask primarily uses capric triglyceride. This is also included in the Honey Mask, but with 60% confirmed honey and a lot of other ingredients it should be much lower than 40%. Capric triglyceride is a coconut oil derivative. It's included in a lot of other well-known skincare products and definitely not as bad as straight up raw coconut oil. But if you have a sensitivity or are clog-prone to coconut-derived ingredients, I'd say avoid the Fig/Honey Masks.\n- The Honey Mask is an easy universal recommendation to most people. But all these masks are meant to target different things. Anyone wondering which one to get should primarily choose one for their own skin concerns.\n\ntldr; honey for moisture/mugwort for soothing/fig for physical exfoliating\n\nThank you for reading this word vomit! By the way, if anyone has any tips for wearing glasses on top of wash-off masks, I'd love to know.",

I used this in the AM. Doesn’t react with tret creams. Loved using this although fragrance can be a downside.\n\n>WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ahaglow S Foaming Facewash** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 2 months {*currently using in the AM*}\n\nActive Ingredients: Salicylic Acid, Glycolic Acid\n\nBrief review: Bought this because i was tired of purchasing 50ml small bottles of foaming facewash since this was available in a 100ml pack. The ingredients are ok. Not as good as oraface. The pump is wasteful and more product is wasted than used. Didn’t cause breakouts. Decent face wash.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cetaphil oily skin facewash** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 2 years + {*currently using in the PM*}\n\nBrief review: Absolutely in love with this product. Holygrail face wash, can always rely on this face wash. I first started using this when I first started breaking out and this delivered well. I still use it in the PM only to avoid actives overload.\n\n>WRP. Holy grail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Toners*\n\n**Simple kind to skin toner** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 4 months {*not using currently*}\n\nActive Ingredients: Niacinamide, witch hazel\n\nBrief review: Decent, beginner friendly toner. I loved using it and so did my friends after purchasing it on my recommendation. The witch hazel was the right amount so it did not strip off my skin. It also had some moisturising ingredients because my face did feel supple after use. Although since the production has begun in India and someone said the quality of the moisturiser has deteriorated so did not repurchase.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Minimalist PHA Toner** {*bought on a friends recommendation*}\n\nUsage: 4 weeks {*not using currently*}\n\nActive Ingredients: Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Inulin, Lactococcus Ferment Lysate, Saccharide Isomerate, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Salicylic Acid, Allantoin, Glycerin, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Lysine, Histidine, Arginine, Aspartic Acid, Threonine, Serine, Glutamic Acid, Proline, Glycine, Alanine, Valine, Methionine, Isoleucine, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate. \n\nBrief review: I did not like this toner and I was very hopeful for this toner because it had good reviews, great ingredients and budget price point.. For me the one major requirement in a toner it for it to be of a water consistency, and this has a slightly thick syrupy consistency which just did not suit my skin. I kept getting small bumps and breakouts all over my face and this did not soothe my skin or make is feel supple. This also did not layer well with my actives and instead just made my face feel heavy after using it.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**One Thing H. Cordata Extract** {*self bought - youtuber influenced purchase*}\n\nUsage: 9 weeks {*currently using in the AM/PM*}\n\nIngredients:  Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexaniediol\n\nBrief review: Absolutely in love with this product for its affect on my skin as well as how multifunctional it is. It does what it says and soothes my skin, reduces redness and helps with any irritation caused due to makeup or acne. The only con is the price point is not at all budget friendly. Although I have been using it for the last 9 weeks and have only finished a little more than half the bottle. Although, once I finish this I might try a different one from the ONE THING range.\n\n>WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Serums*\n\n{*Since I was seeing a dermatologist for my acne and acne scars I used a couple of actives that were doctor recommended and since all of those were rx products I would not be reviewing those*}\n\n**Minimalist 2% Alpha Arbutin + 1% HA** {*bought on reddit recomendation*}\n\nUsage: 7 weeks {*currently in use*}\n\nIngredients:  Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin \n\nBrief review: Love it. Since I stopped using all rx products I wanted a serum for my PIH and PIE and reddit had some really good recommendation for this active. So I gave in and bought this and I lve lve love it, in 7 weeks i can see my old pih scars faded and any new red acne I have has a fast healing time after using AA. So definitely have a raving review for this product. I use 2 drops on moist skin (from toner) and it evenly layers out.\n\n>WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Suganda 5% Niacinamide** {*bought after i received a sample*}\n\nUsage: 8 weeks {*currently in use*}\n\nIngredients:  Aqua, Niacinamide (5%), Propylene Glycol, Panthenol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf (Green Tea) Extract, Sodium hyaluronate crosspolymer, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin \n\nBrief review: Again, very glad that my skin loved this product. It helps boost the effect f my minimalist AA serum. Helps in controlling the oiliness of my very oily skin in summers, and the two ingredients centella asiatica and green tea extract helps spreading 2 drops well on my full face and avoid over usage of products. So, I will 100% keep using this for life because I love it.\n\n>Holy Grail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Formularx Lactic Acid Serum** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 4 weeks {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients:  Water, lactic acid, caprylic/capric triglyceride, gluconolactone, glycerin, cetearyl alcohol, sodium hydroxide, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, phenoxyethanol, agastache mexicana flower/leaf/stem extract, disodium edta, xanthan gum, ethylhexylglycerin. \n\nBrief review: So I used this product twice in a week (in the PM) and this has a cream like consistency and my skin just hated it. I could see red ness and irritation on my skin as soon as I applied it. I even made sure not to use it with any actives but it still did not d anything for my skin and just irritated it. So, it is just lying on my self with no use and my heart hurts because this was so expensive and had god reviews on ig. So this this brand really isn't reliable. I love the moisturiser but this formula just did not work even when my skin is used to strong actives.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Moisturiser*\n\n**Acrofy Acne Lotion** {*derm recommended*}\n\nUsage: 1 year + {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients: -/-\n\nBrief review: Good/basic moisturiser for acne prone skin, helped me when I had the worst breakouts of my life. It is creamy consistency and does feel a little heavy and doesn't really mattify the skin. Stopped using it because my dermatologist recommended a different one.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ahaglow Acne Moisturising Gel** {*derm recommended*}\n\nUsage: 2 months {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients: -/-\n\nBrief review: This is an ok moisturiser, I don't like fragrance in my moisturiser so I did not really like this but it did not cause any breakouts but did make my face moisturised. So if you hate fragrance, steer clear of this product.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sebamed Clear Gel** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 3 months {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients: Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Panthenol\n\nBrief review: Loved the moisturiser especially in Delhi summers. Helped skin feel supple and moisturiser, can call this a substitute for HA serum.\n\n>WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Minimalist Sepicalm Oat Moisturiser** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 2 weeks {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients:  Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Squalane, Glycerine, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Sodium Cocoyl Aminoacids, Sarcosine, Potassium Aspartate, Magnesium Aspartate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Avena Sativa (Oat Kernel) Flour, Sodium Polyglutamate, Undecane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Tocopherol Acetate, Arginine, Glycine, Alanine, Histidine, Sodium Lactate, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Tridecane, Aluminium Starch Octenylsuccinate, Trehalose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate \n\nBrief review: My skin hated this, it cause cc all over my skin and was very thick in consistency. I bought this as the the ingredient list matched the one of formularx barrier relief and this was a budget one so went for this. I tried using a normal amount and it was horrible, I also tried using a very small amount since it is thick and even then it just made my skin sweat and break out. So I stopped using and thought that this might help during winters but again just made my skin suffocate. It is probably a good moisturiser but not for my skin type at all. So now just to finish off the product i use it on my hands or as an eye cream.\n\n>WNRP. Holy Fail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Formularx Barrier Relief Moisturizer** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 10 weeks {*currently in use*}\n\nIngredients: Water, caprylic/ capric triglyceride, glycerin, niacinamide, propanediol, cetearyl alcohol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, sodium hyaluronate, colloidal oatmeal, panthenol, allantoin, ceramide np, ceramide ap, ceramide eop, phytosphingosine, cholesterol, linoleic acid, sodium lauroyl lactylate, xanthan gum, butylene glycol, carbomer, tocopherol, phenoxyethanol, dimethicone, disodium edta, linolenic acid, ethylhexylglycerin. \n\nBrief review: I love this, my skin loves this and I really hate that I love it because it is a very problematic brand. But, nevertheless, the product deserves the love, it is lightweight and still moisturises my skin well. In winters I get weird dry patches on my skin and it peels off. This moisturiser prevented it. It layers well with my actives and makeup and it overall soothing and does the work it claims. I am almost one with my first tube and even though it is expensive, it lasts a good time for me so can call it worth the money. I also love how it is in an aluminium tube instead of a plastic one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Sunscreen*\n\n**UV Doux Sunscreen gel**\n\nUsage: currently in use {*only use when I step outside*}\n\nBrief review: I love this, bought this on recommendations from this channel and the texture is oh so lovely. The only con is the smell as it smells like baby powder x old deo lol but still a good purchase.\n\n>WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Miscellaneous*\n\n**Sheet Mask - The Face Shop**\n\nReally loving these face masks these days incase anyone wanted a review, hehe.",

    "body": "Hi all!  \n\n\nI am back with another skin conditions post. This one is on perioral dermatitis.   \n\n\nAdmittedly, when I began researching this, I knew zilch about PD except that it was acne-like breakouts around the mouth,  and as I began to research it, it seems that there isn't a whole lot that is known about it. Fortunately, it is a highly treatable condition that seems to overlap to a degree with rosacea (earning it the earlier name  of \"steroid rosacea\") and even seborrheic dermatitis.  \n\n\n**As always, please feel free to correct or inform me of anything wrong, and also feel free to post/discuss what helps your PD.**\n\n# What is Perioral Dermatitis\n\nPerioral dermatitis (PD) is a chronic, recurrant inflammatory disease that most commonly occurs in the perioral region of the face (the area around the mouth). It can also affect the area around the nose, and in roughly 20&#37; of cases, it can manifest around the eyes (though it goes by another name if around the eyes: peri-orificial dermatitis).   \n\n\nIt afflicts around 1&#37; of the population of the United States, particularly those with fair skin, and predominately occurs in women between 18-45, with 20s and 30s having peak incidence.   \n\n\nIt presents as small, red, tender, sometimes itchy bumps that can flake and burn. While commonly mistaken for acne, it is distinct from acne in that it only presents in specific locations, spares the small area around the lips, and lacks pustules (whiteheads).\n\n# Causes of Perioral Dermatitis\n\nThe causes of perioral dermatitis are unclear. It is a relatively \"young\" disease that was only first described as a distinct condition in 1964. It is first and foremost an inflammatory condition, and is aggravated by ingredients and habits that can create inflammation either in the skin or in the body. \n\nWhile I was researching PD, the one constant that showed up again and again is that it is aggravated by corticosteroid use -- both topical and inhaled. To specify, that means not just creams like kenalog, triamcinolone, and over-the-counter hydrocortisone, but also asthma inhalers (including Advair, Flovent, and ProAir aka Albuterol) and nasal allergy mists like Beconase, Flonase, Nasonex, Omnaris, and Veramyst. \n\nLess commonly, but still a factor to consider are hormones, where monthly shifts can put the condition into overdrive. More frustrating is that oral contraceptives can worsen PD in some. \n\nOther causes can be fluoridated toothpaste, high SPF value sunscreens¹, sunscreens with the filters zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, the ingredient \"isopropyl myristate,\" improperly removing makeup or sleeping in makeup, occlusive ointments (Vaseline, Aquaphor, and oils, for example), heavy creams with occlusive ingredients, and cold creams (wipe-off cleansing creams that leave a residue, like Pond's). In one case, a woman's favorite lip balm (containing the ingredient propyl gallate) caused her PD.⁶\n\n# Treatment\n\nPD can look like many other conditions, such as acne, angular cheilitis, rosacea, or seborrheic dermatitis, and requires treatment of a professional due to the inflammatory nature of the condition. \n\nThe most important thing for anyone suffering from PD is to discontinue steroid use - whether cold-turkey or weened off with the management of a healthcare professional. While topical steroids can seem to improve the condition, they frequently create a rebound effect, which can make the condition worse. \n\nOnce steroids are removed, the skin will get worse before getting better. This is the toughest part of PD for most people. Topical antibiotics or topical immunosuppresants (such as Pimecrolimus or Elidel) are frequently prescribed due to their tremendously  helpful anti-inflammatory effects on PD, and azelaic acid can prove useful in some cases. In very severe cases, oral antibiotics can be prescribed in addition to topicals. \n\nWhile healing from PD, the skin should not be cleansed with any cleanser, and makeup and skincare products should be avoided completely until the condition resolves. And no matter how tempting, PD should never be scrubbed, as this worsens the inflammation. \n\nOnce treated, it is encouraged to use liquid or gel sunscreens as well as soap-free cleansers that do not dry out the skin, as TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss) is significant in people who suffer from PD.\n\n# Long-Term Care\n\nSome people have PD once in their lives, while others may combat it on and off for several years. If you fall into the latter, it is important to try to avoid triggers that can cause the condition to reoccur (particularly steroid use). That means cleansing your skin each day with gentle cleansers, always removing makeup (removing it with a wipe does *NOT* count - you need to cleanse it away thoroughly with an oil cleanser that rinses cleanly), and using light products, particularly around the areas typically affected. \n\nPrescriptions like azelaic acid and over-the-counter .1&#37; adapalene (Differin)² may  also help to manage the condition in the long-term. \n\nI've put together a list below of some cleansers and moisturizers that are recommended for people suffering from PD. Again, like with my rosacea list, this is not a be-all-end-all list. None of the products listed contain isopropyl myristate or heavy occlusive ingredients.\n\n## Recommended Products\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser** \n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Stearyl Alcohol and Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate​,​ Polysorbate 60​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Panthenol​,​ T-Butyl Alcohol,​ Tocopherol​.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Wate/Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryl Glycol/Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**Avene Extremely Gentle Cleanser Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (avene Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Serine, Cetrimonium Bromide, Coco-Glucoside, Dipotassium Phosphate, Disodium Edta, Disodium Phosphate, O-Phenylphenol, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Water (Aqua).*\n\n**Spectro Jel Cleanser for Blemish-Prone Skin - Fragrance Free**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Hydroxypropyl Methocellulose, Polysorbate 20, Cetyl Alcohol (moisturizer), Hydrated Silica, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Diazolidinyl Urea, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Sorbitan Oleate.*\n\n## Foaming Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Terastearate, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric, Glycerides, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Sodium Chloride, Phytosphingosine, Citric Acid, Edetate Disodium, Dihydrate, Sodium, Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Olay Foaming Face Wash Sensitive**\n\n>*Ingredients: Water/Eau, Glycerin, Sodium Myristoyl Sarcosinate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Polyquaternium-10, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Laureth-10, Disodium Lauroamphodiacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, DMDM Hydantoin.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate​,​ PEG-120 Methyl Glucoside Dioleate,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Hydroxide​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Capryloyl Glycine​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Citric Acid​,​ Acrylates Copolymer​.*\n\n## Makeup Removers\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm**\n\n>*Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Polyethylene, PEG-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Water / Aqua / Eau, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol.*\n\n**Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Mineral Oil, PEG-8 Glyceryl Isostearate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclomethicone, Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Isostearic Acid, Glycerin, Phenoexyethanol.*\n\n## Moisturizers\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Ceteareth-20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Phosphate, Potassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben.*\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3-Diisosterate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide 1, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium phosphate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 20, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Active - Dimethicone, 1\\%.

        "body": "I’ve been diagnosed with Peri-orbital Dermatitis by my dermatologist. I’ve had it for at least 10 years. Peri-orbital means it presents around my eyes, nose and mouth. My worst flare ups cover all three areas, my most frequent flare ups present just around my nostrils. \n\nYes, you’re correct that causes are basically unknown. Successful treatments can vary wildly. \n\n(personally, I’m convinced it has a fungal element, specially related to candida imbalance. That’s just my opinion. I have used OTC topicalS and been prescribed anti-fungal topicals and pills, none of that worked. I believe it is related to gut microbiome health. Our skin is a direct reflection of what’s going on intrinsically in our bodies) \n\nI want chime in here about Zinc Oxide. You mention it as a possible cause. I want others out here to know that high concentration Zinc Oxide Cream is the ONLY thing that stops my flare ups. So if you have PD, I recommend patch testing a high ZO cream on one or two of the papules and see if it helps you. Incidentally, I’ve found recently that micronized ZO particles actually work faster for my than larger particles. So I stopped using Desitin Max strength and started using Neutrogena Sheer Zinc for face with 22% ZO. It stops my flare ups completely in a matter of a day or so, versus 4+ days with the Desitin. \n\nI’ll list below everything I’ve tried in case it’s helpful. The other product I find helpful is daily probiotic pills containing Lactobacillus Acidophilus. I get less flare ups when I take daily probiotics. \n\nDIDN’T WORK: \nAntibacterial Rx creams, I believe I had both Erythromycin and Dapsone. OTC antifungal creams, clotrimazole, miconazole and terbinafine. I also had an oral Rx for Lamisil, it was generic and I can’t recall the generic name. OTC topical steroids, hydrocortisone. Violet extract. Cutting out SLS from from my toothpaste and hair products. (I never cleansed with SLS, always either soap or oil) Changing my diet to an acne safe diet. Getting sun. Staying out of sun. Sulphur washes. Leaving it alone.",

        "body": "I didn’t have a severe case and it largely consisted of redness and small closed comedones with some inflamed ones. I had no idea what perioral dermatitis was and assumed all this redness was broken capillaries from a Clarisonic. \n\nIt wasn’t until I went to a dermatologist and asked her about it that she said it looked like perioral dermatitis. I was prescribed Finacea and in one month the results have been astounding. Redness has significantly reduced and no closed comedones or inflamed pimples anywhere. Again mine wasn’t severe but for anyone who has it I think azelaic acid is a great choice. \n\nI should point out I never use steroids, I’m 30F and I think this was due to over moisturizing after over exfoliating. I also think the occlusive nature of aquaphor made it much worse. My routine now consists of nothing but cleanser, moisturizer and Finacea. Drastic change from what I was doing before. \n\nThank you for taking the time to post this very informative breakdown of perioral dermatitis.",

    "body": "Here’s a comment I posted about Avant:\n\nAvant’s Deluxe Hyaluronic Acid Vivifying Face & Eye Night Cream (this was being sold in the FFF edit sale last week), we were suppose to get this last December for premium box but instead we got the Pro-Intense Hyaluronic Acid Illuminating Day Cream instead, it’s the same RV $134 and has equally crappy ingredients, I’ve seen hand creams/body creams with better/actual effective formulas.\n\nIngredients for the Avant Face & Eye Cream: aqua (water), Butyrospermum Parkii (shea) butter, glycerin (humectant) cetyl alcohol (texture enhancer, emollient), glyceryl stearate (emulsifying agent), dicaprylyl ether (emollient), propylheptyl caprylate (emollient), dimethicone (type of silicone occlusive), sodium hyaluronate (salt form of hyaluronic acid), niacinamide (Vitamin B3, excellent antioxidant has many beneficial properties), maris aqua (sea water, has more minerals than tap water), Prunus Amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil (emollient which contains lots of skin nourishing fatty acids), allantoin (skin soothing), tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e), peg-75 stearate (texture enhancer, emulsifier), ceteth-20 (texture enhancer), steareth-20 (emulsifier) propylene glycol (humectant, texture enhancers), disodium edta (too lazy to explain this one) sodium polyacrylate (thickening agent, texture enhancer), xanthan gum (thickening agent), lactic acid (when used at this kind of low concentration most likely it’s being used as a pH adjuster), parfum (fragrance), potassium sorbate (preservative), ethylhexylglycerin (preservatives) CI 15985 (orange dye) (FD&C Yellow No. 6), CI 17200 (red dye) (D&C Red No. 33).\n\nHere’s the ingredients for a $134 moisturizer.  It doesn’t take Einstein to figure out all the products from Avant are crap, even if this were $5 it would still be crap. There’s nothing wrong with the ingredients, its just the formulation and ingredients for the moisturizer isn’t worth more than $5, it has no high levels of any active ingredients/patented technology (almost all moisturizers at that price point has patents). If this were ingredients for a dollar store hand cream, then i would buy it, unfortunately it’s $134.  Avant products AREN’T EVEN WORTH the $12 Boxycharm add on/pop up price.\n\nLook at the ingredients for Acure Radically Rejuvenating Whipped Night Cream ($15.99 on iherb.com) \n\nWATER/AQUA/EAU, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CETEARYL OLIVATE, SORBITAN OLIVATE, SCLEROCARYA BIRREA (MARULA) SEED OIL, NYMPHAEA ALBA ROOT EXTRACT, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-1, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-2, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-1, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-9, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-11, COPPER PALMITOYL HEPTAPEPTIDE-14, HEPTAPEPTIDE-15 PALMITATE, PALMITOYL TETRAPEPTIDE-7, PALMITOYL TRIPEPTIDE-1 (PEPTIDE BLEND), FERULIC ACID, ASCORBIC GLUCOSIDE (VITAMIN C), COCONUT ALKANES, PSEUDOALTEROMONAS FERMENT EXTRACT (GLACIAL GLYCOPROTEINS), SALICYLIC ACID COCO-CAPRYLATE/CAPRATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ASPARTIC ACID, LINOLEIC ACID, LINOLENIC ACID, LECITHIN, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, LACTIC ACID/GLYCOLIC ACID COPOLYMER, CURCUMA LONGA (TURMERIC) ROOT EXTRACT, SYMPHYTUM OFFICINALE CALLUS CULTURE EXTRACT.\n\nBesides the fact that this has way more antioxidants/age prevention/hydrating ingredients.  This ingredients list for a $16 moisturizer might look familiar to some people because it’s like 95% the same as a certain Drunk Elephant Moisturizer(it’s just missing a few amino acids at the end of the ingredients list but all the important ingredients are exactly the same, even the peptides are the same).  Looks a thousand times better than all the crappy $130 Avant Moisturizers, and this is just one example, there’s CeraVe, Elf, tons of Korean brand moisturizers, all around or under $20. \n\nDECIEM’s hand cream $16 for 100ML\nAqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propanediol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Copper Lysinate/Prolinate, Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Methylglucoside Phosphate, Proline, Alanine, Serine, Pseudoalteromonas Ferment Extract, Tremella Fuciformis Sporocarp Extract, Tocopherol, Betaine, Cellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Sodium Phosphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Parfum (Fragrance), Limonene, Linalool.\n\nThere’s copper peptide (the next big thing in anti aging), snow mushrooms, amino acids, algae ferment, and Plantago Lanceolata which can reduce dark spots, all this from a hand cream, people were using this as a facial moisturizer cos it’s that good. \n\nMoisturizers which are around $134\n\n- Guerlain’s Abeille Royale Creams (has patent on formulas and also the frigging jar the moisturizer comes in) \n\n* Sisley Black Rose Cream Mask (really this needs no introduction) \n\n* Charlotte Tilbury’s Night Cream\n\n* Dior Capture Totale Firming and Wrinkle Correcting Cream (Again patented formula, with a lot of research and clinical trials)\n\n* Lancer Skincare the Nourish (Dr. Lancer dermatologists for Hollywood Stars) \n\n* Fresh Creme Ancienne Moisturizer (Literally made by hand in a Monastery in Europe) \n\n* Chanel Le Lift Restorative Cream (clinical and in vitro testing, patented formula) \n\n* Caudalie Premium Cru Rich/Normal Cream (again patented formula, developed with Harvard Medical School) \n\n* If you check out CultBeauty the Eve Lom holiday set (the one with the Moisture Cream and cleanser (all full size) are basically the same RV as the stupid Avant moisturizer. \n\nThe list can go on forever, also Anti pollution micellar water from Chanel only costs $45. If you take a look at the ingredients for Avant’s Micellar Water it’s missing a very crucial ingredient that the majority of “high end/effective” micellar water contain, PEG-6 Caprylic/ Capric Glycerides.  Seriously this is not even worth $1. \nLastly someone from this subreddit did some research on this company, I think she concluded it was being used to launder money. But the fact that they’re selling you crap for $100+ is enough proof for me.\n\nNow the 111skin products we get from boxycharm or Ipsy are NOT the same as the ones sold in retail stores or 111skin’s online site.  The hydra gel moisturizer that came from Ipsy for example has a completely different ingredients list from the “real” moisturizer.\n\nIngredients from 111skin Cryo Activating Hydra Gel Ipsy version: \nAloe Barbadensis Gel, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Butylene Glycol, Isohexadecane, Dipropylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond / Amande Douce) Oil, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Betaine, Lecithin, Pyrus Malus (Apple / Pomme) Fruit Water, Allantoin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Hydroxyacetophenone, Trehalose, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Aluminium Dicetyl Phosphate, BHT, Tetrasodium EDTA, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow / Achillée) Extract, Xanthan Gum, Menthol, Menthyl Lactate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Fragrance / Parfum, Limonene, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Linalool.\n\nIngredients from 111skin’s site for the Hydra Gel:\nAQUA / WATER / EAU, NELUMBO NUCIFERA (LOTUS) ROOT WATER, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, GLYCERIN, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND / AMANDE DOUCE) OIL, SODIUM ACRYLATES COPOLYMER, CARBOMER, TETRAHEXYLDECYL ASCORBATE, ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, BETAINE, LECITHIN, PROPANEDIOL, BENZYL ALCOHOL, HORDEUM VULGARE (BARLEY / ORGE) SEED EXTRACT, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PRUNUS PERSICA (PEACH / PÊCHE) JUICE, PYRUS MALUS (APPLE / POMME) JUICE, TRITICUM VULGARE (WHEAT / BLÉ) SEED EXTRACT, DISODIUM EDTA, PANAX GINSENG ROOT EXTRACT, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, TRIHYDROXYSTEARIN, ACHILLEA MILLEFOLIUM (YARROW / ACHILÉE) EXTRACT, SODIUM HYALURONATE, MENTHOL, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, ALOE VERA LEAF EXTRACT, GLYCERYL UNDECYLENATE, MENTHYL LACTATE, XANTHAN GUM, GLUCOMANNAN, FRAGRANCE / PARFUM, BENZYL SALICYLATE, LIMONENE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL.\n\nSee the difference? The Ipsy one although it advertises that it’s made with lotus water, there’s no lotus anything in the ingredients. It’s full of texture enhancers and solvents, IMO they were mainly trying to copy the “gel texture” of the real moisturizer.  The real moisturizer that’s $200 isn’t that much better. No expensive ingredients or actives....Check out the Rovectin Lotus Water Cream, made from 75% lotus flower extract (I’m assuming extracts holds a lot more nutrients than lotus root water), and it’s $20 but it goes on sale for $10, has similar light texture etc etc.  Usually the “made for beauty boxes 111skin products” will have “Made in China for 111skin” on the packaging. The real products use to be made in Bulgaria and now I think it’s made in UK, and some are made in the US.  Even if the ingredients line up like the 111skin vitamin c serum from Ipsy and the old formula of the vitamin c from 111skin’s site, the texture, colour, smell are completely different.  The real one had a serum like texture, transparent, had some kind of smell (I forgot the smell, I compared the products like a year ago).  The Ipsy version has the texture of water, yellow tint, no smell I think. Even the real products from 111skin are total ripoffs...what the hell does that say about the “fake” ones? \n\nTL:DR - both Avant and 111skin products are crap, 111skin sends out fakes to beauty boxes but even the real products are crap.  Avant is a sketchy company and their products aren’t even worth the $12 add on price.  It doesn’t matter if Avant’s website looks legitimate, every MLM website looks a thousand times more legitimate than Avant but it’s still a scam.",

It smells plasticky to me.\n\n-1 point for the weird waxy feeling of this crea on my skin. \n\nBesides for that, this cream is absolutely perfect. Its moisturizing, its thick, and its occlusive. It took me 2 years to finish this because I really disliked the waxy feeling when I first started using it so I stopped for about 6 months. Then I came back to it and have been using it consistently once a day before sleeping. \n\nBesides for the discontinued Laneige Timefreeze sleeping mask, this is a good moisturizer for my very dry skin; skin so dry that it would flakes off in small pieces during the winter months if I dont apply moisturizer. \n\nWorks great under makeup for me, but it may be because I have dry skin so it gets absorbed in quickly. However I could imagine that makeup would be slippy on top on a layer of cream if your skin is less dry than mine. \n\nRight now Im exploring other creams to find my holy grail but if I cant find anything, I would fall back on this one. \n\nMy ranking of best moisturizer for my dry skin: \n\n1. Laneige Timefreeze sleeping mask. (Discontinued)\n\n2. Etude Soon Jung 2x Barrier Cream (od version-discontinued). This one was slightly less moisturizing, but it beats the Kikumasamune one for being scentless and came in an easy squeeze tube. \n\n3. Kikumasamune Sake Cream\n\n4. Illyoon Ceramide Ato Cream. Nice squeeze tube. Tube is really wide though. No scent. Non-fussy. \n\n5. Laneige Cica sleeping mask. Pleasant scent. Jar. Less moisturizing than the above 3 but has a nice calming effect thats helpful in the summertime. \n\n6. Hanyul Rice cream. Perfumed rice scent. Great moisturizer. Bouncy cream texture. More expensive than most of the other ones on this list. \n\n7. Hanyul Pure Artemisia cream. Lovely calming cream. Really similar to the Laneige cica cream. Pricier than the other products on this list. \n\n8. Sulwhasoo Overnight Vitalizing Sleeping mask. Great daytime moisturizer. Too much ginseng breaks me out though.  ",

    "body": "It is occasionally said on this subreddit that shelf life of estradiol gels is probably many months, if not years.  We had a professional chemist who visited recently who said the same in this thread:  [We have a new mod, and the same old principles: everyone is welcome here! : ](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/1bh7ald/we_have_a_new_mod_and_the_same_old_principles/)\n\nBut as far as I know, no one here has done any objective testing, and I haven't heard any arguments that settle the question in my mind.  I found two studies that make me think that oxidation might be a real problem.  Both studies came out of the same university, and both created experimental transdermal formulations for both estradiol and progesterone.  Both studies measured how much estradiol and progesterone was left after 6 weeks of \"storing in tubes at room temperature\".\n\nThis study found that the estradiol in the experimental formula degraded 9%-27% and the progesterone degraded 17%-32% after 6 weeks (in Table 4): [Evaluation of an eucalyptus oil containing topical drug delivery system for selected steroid hormones - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16950579/)  The study used microemulsions using an oil (eucalyptus oil), an alcohol (ethanol), and a surfactant (Brij 30).  I don't think anyone here uses this particular recipe, but there are similar recipes on this board that are microemulsions using an oil, an alcohol, and a surfactant.\n\nThis study used a different formulation and found that both the estradiol and the progesterone degraded 61% in just two weeks! (Table 4):  [Skin permeation of different steroid hormones from polymeric coated liposomal formulations - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16202573/)  The experiment was ended after 2 weeks due to microbial spoilage (no alcohol in the formula).\n\nNeither of these studies use \"our\" recipes, although the first one used a recipe similar.  I'm not enough of a chemist to make even an educated guess as to whether there is anything about our recipes that better protect against degradation over time compared to ones in these studies.  Any thoughts from real chemists would be greatly appreciated here.\n\nBoth studies found that gelling the formula with a carbomer or even more so with a polymeric emulsifier (brand name Pemulen TR 1, aka Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer) slowed down the degradation a lot, as well as increasing skin absorption.  The part about increasing skin absorption surprised me, but both studies found it.  Still the degradation was significant:  9% for estradiol and 19% for progesterone after 6 weeks in the first study.\n\nWhat I'm thinking now is that it might be worth the trouble to:\n\n1. Add a tocopherol based antioxidant like this one at 0.5% [Vitamin E, Mixed Tocopherols T50](https://lotioncrafter.com/collections/antioxidants/products/vitamin-e-mixed-tocopherols-t50)\n2. Add a broad spectrum preservative to any formula with less than 60% alcohol, such as adding this one at 0.5% [Liquid Germall Plus](https://lotioncrafter.com/collections/preservatives-stabilizers/products/liquid-germall-plus)\n3. Use opaque, airless bottles\n4. Try thickening with with Pemulen TR 1.  The studies added it last at 2% with gentle stirring.  It's available at [Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZRNP54H/?coliid=I3W0QVDVGCR3ZT&colid=QWWT5FT0LE2T&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it&th=1).",

        "body": "Wow, that's an excellent post and a lot of research!\n\nThis may bring a very interesting discussion about our primitive methods (basically, most of them are just a dissolution in ethanol, with some penetration enhancer, with or without a thickener): as you noted, both of these studies use more \"advanced\" formulations: microemulsions and liposomes, essentially the same thing as the cells that make our bodies, that is \"small balls\" containing interesting things (the interesting thing here being the lipophilic hormones)\n\nMicroemulsions are generally spontaneous and stable, but not perfectly so, and liposome likewise and even less so: think about all these tiny balls wanting to coalesce to form bigger balls.\n\nI haven't read both these studies yet (I will, I promise!) but I assume what was lowered was not the actual E2 or P4 content, but the skin flux, because tiny balls go very well through the skin, while bigger balls don't go so well - that's my educated guess. The actual E2 or P4 content should remain the same, unless some microbial contamination found them yummy\n\nNow about why a carbomer or an crosspolymer helps: think about all these tiny balls being either separated from eachother by more viscosity: they wouldn't coalesce so rapidly\n\nYour proposed solutions are well thought, but for slightly different problems: oxygenation is unlikely to be a problem, spoiling won't happen if there's at least 30% ethanol (vodka doesn't spoil)  and thickening should be sufficient if using a carbomer\n\nThe simpler solution if people start using more advanced formulas (like microemulsions) is to shake them off: that's how you can mix oil and water (for a while), and that's how you can rehomogenize an emulsion that has separated\n\nYou have extremely good intuitions and research skills. If you want to dig more into microemulsions, I will be very happy to help you, but unless you don't have a lot of E2, the skin flux of the usual methods discussed here should be enough for most of the uses",

        "body": "Wow, thanks for the heads up. Publically I say my personal recipe uses orange oil. But in actual fact, I use eucalyptus oil as a penetration enhancer (1:1 substitute for orange oil). I don't publically share this, since eucalyptus oil isn't tried and tested like orange oil is. This is... very concerning... For me specifically. This probably doesn't matter for everyone else, but it's very concerning for me. Perhaps that's why my estradiol dosage is so high. What I think is 8mg per day, is actually substantially less... Hmm.\n\nOne thing I don't understand is why their ethanol-eucalyptus oil solution is a microemulsion. Correct me if I'm wrong, but eucalyptus oil is soluble in ethanol. Emulssifying shouldn't be necessary?\n\nReading through the paper, it is good it notes estrone is the main degredation product here. For a while I had actually doubted that, ever since talking to the chemist in that old post you linked. But since this paper notes estrone was the most common degredation product of the estradiol in the solution, I'm inclined to think the chemist was wrong.\n\nJust beneath that, the paper proposes the mechanism behind this degredation is hydrolysis. I.e. The steroids may be reacting with the water droplets in the microemulsion, and degrading. My spray is annhydrous ethanol. I never bothered to dillute it to 70% ethanol out of laziness, it appears that may have saved my whole batch. In any case, I doubt this issue applies to conventional estrogels, even ones with a significant water content. This is because we don't make microemulsion gels here. We make miscible, homogenous gels/sprays. We don't do emulsions.\n\nThe paper confirms my assumption that eucalyptus oil and ethanol synergise with one another to have a brilliant antimicrobial effect together.\n\n\"... On the other hand, this fact \\[The presence of cineol, a component of eucalyptus oil\\] may cause skin irritation.\" Not in my experience. My spray is 5% eucalyptus oil (v/v) and it's very easy on my skin. Nowhere near as harmful as orange oil. And the paper concurs eucalyptus oil is an effective penetration enhancer\n\nThanks for that u/Ljb66882 that was a good read! Thanks for bringing this to my attention.\n\nAlso here's a download link to the paper for anyone interested: [https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2006.08.003](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2006.08.003)\n\nEdit: My batch of spray is maybe... 8 months old now?

With invisible sunscreen, you gotta know till when you to massage the sunscreen. I feel with other sunscreens, you've an idea on how long to blend or massage. With invisible sunscreen, if not applied properly, it starts pilling off.\n\nThe texture was matte, so probably it felt on my face for a while post application. My biggest issue with this was that it irritated my eyes if I accidentally brushed over anywhere near my eye area (I didn't directly touch my eyes). And seeing as it happened multiple times, I think i was turned off this product, wanting to never purchase it.\n\nWhich won't be an issue coz I don't see this product anywhere.

It's a steal for its price. Very lightweight, blends easily , gives a matte finish but doesn't feel that it's sitting on your skin (like many matte products). \n\nIf your skin type is combination leaning to dry side, this won't be sufficient for you. As it states, it's great for oily skin as it feels nothing when you apply, and works wonderfully for Summers. \n\nCons: Tbh, None. It's not as great as some other moisturizers that I've used, but for the price, it's a great product.\n\nI might repurchase it again unless I get some k-beauty products on good discount.\n\n**3)Vaseline Gluta Hya Antioxidant SPF 50 PA+++ Sunscreen**\n\n**Price:** 699/- for 175ml\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Disodium Phenyl Dibenzimidazole Tetrasulfonate, Triethanolamine, Dimethicone, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Hydroxide, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Cystine, Glycine, Sodium PCA, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glutathione, Cyclopentasiloxane, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Polysorbate 20, Perfume, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Cyclomethicone, Petrolatum, BHT, Tocopherol\n\n**Texture:** Serum like lotion\n\n**Fragrance:** Yes\n\n**My Experience:** It's a wonderful sunscreen at a very decent price. \n\nPros are that it's  very lightweight, has a serum like texture that blends in seconds. It's claim of serum bursting into water and absorbing quickly, is true. It always gives a very dewy and shiny finish.\n\nCons - Very sticky, though it does feels normal after a few minutes. \nIt doesn't prevent tanning. My hands are quite tanned, and since its texture is like a serum, I did use quite a lot of product while applying it on my hands. There was no pilling, but no saving from tan.\n\nI would repurchase it for other seasons like winters or monsoons. For now, I've purchased Nivea sunscreen again, my HG for body sunscreen.\n\nDo share your experiences if you've tried these or similar products.\n\n",

    "body": "**Uhm, what the heck are you talkin' 'bout?**\n\nHi AB! I'm a super long time lurker, first time poster. I hope I've followed all the rules!\n\nHere is the deal:\n\nSo, I have been on the hunt for a daily mist that does more than just \"this makes my skin so hydrated throughout the day!\" That's nice and all, however the reality is: It **should be** hydrating as I'm literally spraying my face and saturating it with liquid. In most of the more famous \"thermal water\" mists, its literally just water and pressure.\n\n\n**a note** I'm not bashing water mists, I own one! I think they are great for what their purpose is, pure hydration. I just find it easier to put some bottles water in a fine mist spray bottle, tbh.\n\n\n**So, what are you getting at here?**\n\nI have skin that (like many of us here) isn't flawless, spotless perfection. So I have been on the hunt for a mist that does more than simply hydrate, be cause we all deserve a mist that can help us with skin problems too, right? I think that some of the issue is, when looking for a mist, we all just assume that **hydration is all we are supposed to get from a mist** & that just didn't sit right with me. I feel like we should at least get a little bit more. Whitening/brightening effects, acne control, sebum control, pore minimizer, etc. I wan't all a mist has to offer!\n\n\n**You said you were on a hunt, did you find anything? Or are you just smack talking?**\n\nThis is why I'm here. I found a few mists that I would like to share and hope to get some recommendations for more! I hope to compile some type of list, so any and all suggestions are welcome. I would especially love some mists from brands that we may not see that often because I'd love to broaden my horizons!\n\n\n**Here are the mists I found so far and their ingredients:** (I hope anyone can add to this)\n\n\n**BENTON Honest TT Mist**\n\nIngredients: Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tee Tree) Leaf Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Extract, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycerin, Altharea Roea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Poly Glutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Psidium Guajava Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract\n\n\n**ELENSILIA Escargot Botanic Garden Bee Venom Lavender Mist**\n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Sodium Citrate, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil,Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Chloride, Chlorphenesin, Adenosine, Magnesium Sulfate, Citric Acid, Glycosaminoglycans, Bee Venom, Honey Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, Propolis Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Polygonum Multiflorum Root Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Extract, Phellinus, Linteus Extract, Angelica Gigas Root Extract, Morus Alba Bark Extract, Paeonia Lactiflora Root Extract, Sophora Angustifolia Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Galactomyces, Ferment Filtrate, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil\n\n\n**Snail White SYN-AKE Mist**\n\nIngredients: Snail secretion filtrate,deionized water, SYN-AKE (dipeptide diaminobutyroyl benzalymide diacetate) Alpha arbutin, dipotassium glycyrrhizate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Morus nigra fruit extract, rubus idaeus (raspberry extract) Prunus Avium (sweet cherry extract) fragaria vesca (strawberry fruit extract\n\nHonorable mention: I have **TFS Bamboo Water, sebum control mist.** I like it, it controls some oil, hydrates and doesn't have a strong scent. All around, a good buy and I use it occasionally. I can't find the ingredients for it and the bottle I have is in korean.\n\n**Elizavecca Hell-Pore Water Up Peptide EGF Mist One Button**\n\nThis is tough to find ingredients for but I have a summary thanks to u/Perpetuallydrifting\n\nFormulated with Squalane, western flower rose watercollagen, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil and humectants that moisturize and leave skin dewy, it's also infused with a adenosine, niacinamide Complex that supports Whitening and wrinkles.\n\n**MISSHA First Treatment Essence Mist** rec'd by u/snailslimeandbeespit\n\nIngredients: Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Saccharomyces/Panax Ginseng Root Ferment Filtrate, Propanediol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Niacinamide, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Betaine, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Piper Methysticum Leaf/Root/Stem Extract, Beta Vulgars (Beet) Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Cornus Officinaus Fruit Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgars Extract, Cassia Alata Leaf Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Trethylehexanoin, Pentylene Glycol, Glycerin, Peg-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydrolyzed Corn Starch, Raffinose, Polyquaternium-51, Water (Aqua), Tromethamine, Lactobacillus Ferment, Adenosine, Ethylhexyglycerin, Acetic Acid, Lactic Acid, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**DIY Mist of Holy Snails Snowbang Essence** rec'd by u/snailslimeandbeespit (decanted into a fine mist sprayer)\n\nIngredients: Ingredients: Distilled Water, (Abronia Villosa Leaf Extract, Agave Americana Stem Extract, Blue Lotus Extract, Calendula Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Chamomile Extract, Evening Primrose Root Extract, Fouqueria Splendens Stem Extract, Ginger Root Extract, Ginkgo Biloba Extract, Ginseng Extract, Goji Berry Extract, Green Tea Extract, Helichrysum Extract, Hibiscus Extract, Horse Chestnut Extract, Iris Florentina Extract, Licorice Root Extract, Mushroom Extract, Pumpkin Seed Extract, Opuntia Coccinellifera Flower Extract, Yucca Brevifolia Root Extract), Hydrolyzed Oats, (Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6, Ceramide EOP, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthum Gum), Glycerin, (Water, Caprylyl Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Wasabi Root Extract, Ginger Root Extract, Garlic Bulb Extract), (Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methyparaben, Propylparaben), Disodium EDTA \n\n(Non-AB) **MARIO BADESCU Facial Spray With Aloe, Herb and Rosewater** rec'd by u/margotmargot11 and u/scaperoute\n\nIngredients: Aqua (Water, Eau), Propylene Glycol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Rosa Canina Extract, Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme) Leaf Extract, Fucus Vesiculosus Extract, Gardenia Florida Fruit Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Polysorbate 20, Parfum (Fragrance), Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Chloride, Citronellol, Geraniol, CI 17200 (Red 33), CI 42090 (Blue 1).\n\n**Nature Republic Bee Venom Mist** rec'd by u/mamukizzy\n\nIngredients taken from NR site: Water, Macadamia ternifolia seed oil, glacier water, bee venom, honey extract, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, salicyclic acid, butylene glycol, citrus nobilis (mandarin orange) fruit extract, gardenia florida fruit extract, angelica archangelica leaf extract, houttuyniacordata extract, acoruscalamus root extract, foeniculumvulgare (fennel) fruit cindiumofficinale root extract, chamomillarecucita *matricaria) flower extract, viscum album (mistletoe) extract, camellia japonica flower extract, peg-60 hydrogenated castor oil, tocopheryl acetate, phenoxyethanol, 1,2-hexanediol, caprylyl glycol, tropolone, disodium edta, oleaeuropea (olive) furit oil, canangaodorata flower oil, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf oil, lavandulaangustifolia (lavender) oil, pelargonium graveolens flower oil, pinussylvestris leaf oil (tea tree) leaf oil\n\n**A small note:** Please let me know if you want me to add websites and prices.

It's probably the most finely-misted spray I've ever come across for anything though, but the issue with that is that it's *so fine* that it requires me to spray it continuously around my face for a good 5 seconds to get a good layer on, instead of just a few spritzes.

It’s incredibly lightweight and doesn’t live shiny finish, it’s semi-matte. It has a light creamy gel texture. It is very easy to reapply. It contains fragrance, but it’s very subtle and goes away quickly. It never makes me look like a greasy mess, there i salso no pilling under makeup! Most importantly, it never irritates my skin. There was no irritation, I noticed that it actually calms down the redness and helps with healing my acne scars.\n\nI can confidently say that it quickly become my HG sunscreen!",

Niacinamide is high on the list along with a lot of hanbang which include the famous ginseng ingredients(6 fermented years). It has floral scent to it. Texture is light and absorb well.  It has Triethanol amine  which some said it is dangerous but it is not a problem for me.  No paraben.( press sample ,no affiliate link)\n\n[Hansaeng Cosmetics RIN Bi-gyeol Soo Cream](http://beautyfaceskin123.blogspot.com/2016/07/review-on-hansaeng-cosmetics-rin-bi_28.html)\nIt has the same hanbang ingredients(fermented 6 years ginseng) in the cream with the same smell but with different kind of texture. It is pretty light and calming. The jar is of course luxurious and looks like a blue pearl. Niacinamide is lower than the essence but it is still high. No paraben but contains Triethanol amine  to adjust the ph.

But the physical store still has the label claiming all the Goku-jyun Alpha products have retinol.\n\nHowever, the [Hada Labo SG website](https://www.hadalabo.com.sg/antiageing-1) only lists **one** product in the Goku-jyun Alpha range as having retinol. I will have to check again to see if the Anti-aging + 3D Gel Moisturiser actually has retinol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have several questions:\n\n1. Why is a different version of the product being sold in Singapore? (If it's because Singapore has tighter restrictions on retinoids, why are other products containing retinyl palmitate sold normally?)\n2. Why are stores selling the Lifting+Firming Lotion (Rich) as having retinol, when it actually doesn't?\n3. Is this incompetence, or intentionally false/misleading marketing?\n4. Are there other regions selling the non-retinol version of the \"red\" range?",

Because even japanese snacks like pocky and the drink pocari sweat are from those countries. The real legit ones in japan all have a MADE IN JAPAN at the back. For legit products they actually import it from Japan, and for the sake of local people they slap on a sticker over it with the translation. Meaning when you tear of the outer plastic, inside is the untouched japanese packaging with full on japanese.\n\nWhenever I see the entire packaging is changed, and in english, I'm very suspicious of where it came from. Whether it's locally made or what. I don't know if you know the brand but when I checked Singapore's Fancl, it looked different from the one I know. The different color, the english words, I don't know where it's from but it's not the japanese one. I don't care if the ingredients are the same I just don't like it. I think the Melano CC is from Thailand because of the different packaging. And the period pads Laurier, the ones in english are locally made. Only the shiawase suhada ones are real, because it's the original with a translation sticker at the back.",

    "body": "What are your thoughts on brands who through the years alter their ingredients into a product that no longer resembles their original.\n\nWhen Bare Minerals came out, they touted themselves as a healthy makeup, no toxins, “so healthy you can sleep in it” and all that stuff.\nAll their products were just minerals and no fillers. Powder products only. I didn’t like them - but I respected their vision.\n\nThey sold to Shisedo and then they came out with Bare Skin. A liquid foundation that was fitting in with their theme.\n\nBare Skin Ingredients \nActive Ingredients: Titanium dioxide 11.0%. Inactive Ingredients: Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Coconut Alkanes, Silica, Stearalkonium Hectorite, Lecithin, Glycerin, Maltodextrin, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Jojoba Esters, Propylene Carbonate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Soil Minerals/Syringa Vulgaris (Lilac) Leaf Cell Culture Extract, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol. May Contain: Mica, Iron Oxides, Titanium Dioxide.\n\nThen they released Complexion Protection, another liquid\n\nComplexion Protection Ingredients \n\nACTIVE INGREDIENTS: Titanium dioxide 6.2%\nINACTIVE INGREDIENTS: water, coconut alkanes, propanediol, squalane,\ntrehalose, isostearic acid, glycerin, silica, agar, caprylic/capric\ntriglyceride, globularia cordifolia callus culture extract, salicornia\nherbacea extract, melilotus officinalis extract, coco-caprylate/caprate,\nbutylene glycol, lauroyl lysine, sodium hyaluronate, succinoglycan,\npolysorbate 60, cellulose gum, polyglyceryl-4 laurate/succinate,\nsorbitan sesquiisostearate, magnesium stearate, magnesium hydroxide,\nmagnesium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, potassium\nsorbate, phenoxyethanol. may contain: titanium dioxide, iron oxides.\n\nTHEN most recently they released Bare Pro -sigh-\nWater, Cyclopentasiloxane , Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Butylene Glycol, Silica, Peg-10 Dimethicone, Bis-Butyldimethicone Polyglyceryl-3, Bambusa Arundinacea Stem Extract, Sodium Glutamate, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Sorbitan Sesquiisostearate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Methicone, Papain, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Algin, Tocopherol, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Phenoxyethanol. May Contain: Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxides.\n\nNot terrible, but I feel like this is totally the opposite of what Leslie intended for her brand.\n\nWhat prompted this entire thing, was they just released a new Blush called Gen Nude and it felt soooo different from Bare. I turn it over and look at the ingredients. I was shocked!  All of us in the store working were so surprised to see Bare release this.\n\nMy ingredient lists go from their original blush - 4 ingredients. To the Ready Blush which is still pretty good and then we go to Gen Nude!\n\nLoose Blush Ingredients \n\nBismuth Oxychloride (CI 77163), Mica (CI 77019), Carmine (CI 75470),\nIron Oxide (CI 77491)\n\nReady Blush Ingredients \n\nMica, Lauroyl Lysine, Boron Nitride, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate,\nCaprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Corallina Officinalis Extract,\nOctyldodecyl Stearoyl Stearate, Alaria Esculenta Extract, Tocopherol,\nCamellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Calcium\nKetogluconate, Silica, Carmine (Ci 75470). May Contain: Titanium Dioxide\n(Ci 77891), Iron Oxides (Ci 77491, 77492, 77499), Manganese Violet (Ci\n77742).\n\nGen Nude Blush Ingredients \n\nSynthetic Fluorphlogopite, Diisostearyl Malate, Dipentaerythrityl Hexahydroxystearate, Lauroyl Lysine, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Triethylhexanoin, Sorbitan Sesquiisostearate, Hydrogen Dimethicone, Dimethicone, Tocopherol, Barium Sulfate, Silica, Alumina, Tin Oxide, Chlorphenesin. May Contain (+/-): Mica, Carmine (Ci 75470), Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Iron Oxides (Ci 77491, Ci 77492, Ci 77499), Red 7 Lake (Ci 15850).\n\n4 Dimethicones/Polymers\n\nThey started on QVC saying they would never use synthetic ingredients - and here we are.\n\nI will say the blush looks beautiful on the skin and could compete with any blush out there. So I can understand why they made these changes. However, they haven’t adjusted their marketing and image for these new changes.  They have clientele who have been using Bare since the first day and who refuse to use anything else because Bare is the only thing that won’t bother their skin/is natural/is safe....etc. \n\nThis isn’t a post about Bare, but I am using them as a example as the blush really threw me for a loop. \n\nHow do you feel about brands who not only evolve (as all brands must) but also change what appear to be their core values to remain relevant?",

Even that felt like a sell-out to me...and to see how far they've come now is a whole different level of disappointment. I loved that they had a focus and \"priorities,\" and now that they've done a 180 on those I feel like they've really sold out. Personally I refuse to buy anything other than the loose powder products from them on principle (lol...maybe that belongs on the \"petty\" thread but I don't care).\n\nHonestly I can't think of another brand that had such strong guiding principles to begin with and then tossed them all to the side in pursuit of profit. I don't have a problem with brands changing their focus somewhat (like how UD used to be more alternative makeup and now they're very mainstream), but when your focus is based on \"principle\" and you abandon it completely I really lose respect for you as a brand.",

Since then I’ve found some products that work really well for me and which haven’t been mentioned on this sub before, so I decided to share my shelfie and write some reviews.\n\nI'm happy to hear your opinion about the products or my routine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Skin type**\n\nDry and sensitive, some general redness, not acne-prone.\n\nMy skin reacts to most artificial fragrances and some essential oils. \n\nI also prefer to use products with “natural” ingredients and try to avoid parabens, PEGs, micro plastic and mineral oil as much as possible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Products (from left to right):**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch** \n\nINCI: AQUA, CENTAUREA CYANUS FLOWER WATER, DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS HYBRID OIL, CETEARYL WHEAT STRAW GLYCOSIDES, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM BENZOATE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, STEARIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, TOCOPHEROL, LACTIC ACID\n\nPrice 11 € for 200ml, available at Müller drugstore in Germany\n\nThis gentle cleansing milk is one of my holy grail products. All other cleansers that I’ve tried before where either super drying and/or made me break out. This one isn’t drying at all and yet leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. Only on days when I wear a lot of makeup I need to do an additional oil cleanse. I like that the formulation is not too watery, so it’s easy to spread on my face. It doesn’t have a noticeable smell. The bottle lasts a long time for me, usually over 6 months even with daily use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme**\n\nINCI: HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL, ETHYLHEXYL STEARATE, CERA ALBA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, KAOLIN, ZINC OXIDE, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND) OIL, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice 2 € for 50ml, available at Rossmann drugstore \n\nThis water free balm with oils and beeswax is a thick and oily formulation, similar to a cold cream. I sometimes use it on cold and dry winter days as a thin layer between my daytime moisturizer and sunscreen. I’m not sure if it truly qualifies as an occlusive cream, but in my experience it does help with preventing moisture loss in dry weather. It takes a while to get absorbed into the skin. A little goes a long way and when you apply too much your face is going to shine like crazy. I noticed that when I use this cream several days in a row my skin texture starts to feel a bit smoother than usual. The beeswax smell is nice too. It works well under makeup as long as you give it enough time to dry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dermaveel  (OTC pharmacy cream, made by HEEL)**\n\nINCI: ECTOIN\\*, AQUA, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PANTHENOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, SQUALANE, TOCOPHEROL, OLEA EUROPAEA FRUIT OIL, HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, VANILLA PLANIFOLIA FRUIT EXTRACT, ALCOHOL DENAT., CARBOMER, SODIUM CARBOMER, RHIZOBIAN GUM, CORYLUS AVELLANA BARK EXTRACT, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, C12-16 ALCOHOLS, PALMITIC ACID, CERAMIDE 3\n\n\\*Since this cream is a medical product, its active ingredient (Ectoin) is listed first, even though it’s not the main ingredient.\n\nPrice about 10 € for 30ml in online pharmacies \n\nSo this is a medical product for people with neurodermatitis that was recommended to me by my dermatologist. It has a thick, slightly oily consistency but doesn’t take too long to get absorbed into skin. The smell is slightly chemical. Its active ingredient, Ectoin, is supposed to protect skin cells from environmental stress factors and help with skin barrier restoration. It is also used in other products such as eye drops and nasal sprays.\n\nNow I don’t know enough about skincare to judge how solid the research behind this patented molecule is. When my skin was a bit over exfoliated a few months ago, my experience was that Dermaveel was in fact better at repairing my damaged skin barrier than other moisturizers that I tried.\n\nI only use this cream during the winter months; it’s too heavy for warm summer days, even for my dry skin. I use it as a daytime moisturizer a few times per week; I find it a bit too pricey for everyday use. Unfortunately it does sometimes pill up under my makeup foundation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Manuka Repair Creme/Miel de Manuka Crème Réparatrice (OTC pharmacy cream, made by French brand Comptoirs & Compagnies)**\n\nINCI: MEL, AQUA, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, MACADAMIA TERNIFOLIA SEED OIL, GLYCERYL STEARATE, SQUALANE,SODIUM STEAROYL GLUTAMATE, LEVULINIC ACID, PHENETHYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, BISABOLOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM LEVULINATE, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice about 10 € for 40ml in online pharmacies\n\nThe reason why I bought this was simply that I really wanted to try a Manuka product. It contains 40% GMO 300 Manuka Honey. This isn’t exactly the highest GMO rating, but it’s the best price-performance ratio I could find. Despite its 40% honey content it has an average moisturizer consistency, not sticky, dries fast. The smell is amazing! Very sweet, smells of honey and beeswax.\n\nWith my dry skin I found it not hydrating enough as standalone moisturizer, though it might work for normal to oily skin. I apply this in the evening (few times a week) in combination with my usual moisturizer (TO NMF). On the next morning my skin is smooth and soft; feels slightly exfoliated and overall texture seems to be improved. Manuka honey, or honey in general, is said to have exfoliating properties. Manuka also has anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial effects though I can’t really comment on that since I luckily don’t have any breakouts at the moment.\n\nOnce or twice I made the mistake to use the Manuka repair cream on the same evening as my AHA exfoliator- which resulted in slightly flakey skin on the next morning. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dado Sens Sun - Sonnencreme SPF 30**\n\nINCI: AQUA \\[WATER\\], DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE (UVINUL A PLUS) , ALCOHOL, ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE (UVINUL T 150), BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE (TINOSORB S), GLYCERIN, ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE (OCTISALATE), SUCROSE PALMITATE, DISTARCH PHOSPHATE, PANTHENOL, TITANIUM DIOXIDE (NON-NANO), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CANDELILLA/JOJOBA/RICE BRAN POLYGLYCERYL-3 ESTERS, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM STEAROYL LACTYLATE, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, BENZYLIDENE DIMETHOXYDIMETHYLINDANONE, ALLANTOIN, POLYHYDROXYSTEARIC ACID, SODIUM ALGINATE, CALCIUM ALGINATE, GLYCINE SOJA OIL \\[SOYBEAN\\], ALUMINA, STEARIC ACID, ECTOIN, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, LECITHIN, TOCOPHEROL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE\n\nPrice 20 € for 125ml, available at Müller, Douglas\n\nThis is my favourite sunscreen ever! Definitely a holy grail candidate. Sunscreens have always been a bit problematic for me, for two reasons: 1: I need to use a product without acrylates, which unfortunately are an ingredient in nearly every sunscreen formulation ever.  2: I’m a bit picky about sunscreen filters; I’d rather not use problematic filters like Octocrylene, Octinoxate, Oxybenzone and Homosalate. And now I finally found something that works for me!\n\nDado Sens Sonnencreme SPF 30 has a thick, creamy consistency, perfect for my dry skin but it is probably too much for oily skin. There is no noticeable white cast, however I’m pale as ghost anyway, so results might be different for darker skin tones. It leaves a small amount of shine but I’m not too bothered by this. Smell is slightly chemical (different from usual sunscreen smell) but not very strong.\n\nThe downsides are that it has only SPF 30 and contains alcohol. I don’t find it drying though. What I like best about it is that it has great filters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, PROPANEDIOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ARGININE, ASPARTIC ACID, GLYCINE, ALANINE, SERINE, VALINE, ISOLEUCINE, PROLINE, THREONINE, HISTIDINE, PHENYLALANINE, GLUCOSE, MALTOSE, FRUCTOSE, TREHALOSE, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SODIUM LACTATE, UREA, ALLANTOIN, LINOLEIC ACID, OLEIC ACID, PHYTOSTERYL CANOLA GLYCERIDES, PALMITIC ACID, STEARIC ACID, LECITHIN, TRIOLEIN, TOCOPHEROL, CARBOMER, ISOCETETH-20, POLYSORBATE 60, SODIUM CHLORIDE, CITRIC ACID, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, TRIETHANOLAMINE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, PHENOXYETHANOL, CHLORPHENESIN\n\nPrice 10 € for 100ml, available at Douglas\n\nI actually don’t want to write too much about this one, there are already tons of reviews on this sub. It has fairly good INCIs, doesn’t dry or break me out and is cheap – that’s all that I want in a moisturizer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), LACTIC ACID, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PROPANEDIOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE CROSSPOLYMER, TASMANNIA LANCEOLATA FRUIT/LEAF EXTRACT, ACACIA SENEGAL GUM, XANTHAN GUM, ISOCETETH-20, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL\n\nPrice 7 € for 30ml, available at Douglas\n\nThis is the first acid exfoliator I ever bought, so I can’t really compare it to other products. After a short purging period it got rid of the tiny closed comedones I had all over my face within about 6 weeks.  I like it a lot and use it about twice per week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Timeless Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin C Serum**\n\nINCI: WATER, MAGNESIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE, ALOE BARBADENSIS, GLYCERIN, HYALURONIC ACID, MATRIXYL 3000™, BENZYLALCOHOL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID\n\nThis is usually not available in Europe. I found it at my local TK Maxx store for 10 €. Bought it because I wanted to try Vitamin C. The lightweight, watery formulation is nice. It doesn’t have any noticeable smell.\n\nI’ve been using this for 8 weeks now and don’t really see any difference. When it’s empty I’m probably going to replace it with a more potent Vitamin C product from The Ordinary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Salthouse Totes Meer Therapie - Beruhigende Maske Akut** (Picture only shows lower half of sachet)\n\nINCI: AQUA, CELLULOSE GUM, GLYCERIN, PANTHENOL, PROPANEDIOL, MARIS SAL (DEAD SEA SALT), PROPYLENE GLYCOL, MAYTENUS MACROCARPA (CHUCHUHUASI) BARK EXTRACT, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE POWDER, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) LEAF EXTRACT, CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA FLOWER EXTRACT, PHENOXYETHANOL, CITRIC ACID, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL ALCOHOL\n\nPrice 1.25€ for 2x7ml, available at DM drugstore\n\nThis is a gel mask with Dead Sea salt and other calming ingredients. It calms down irritated skin and reduces redness. Most of the time it doesn’t completely get rid of the redness, but there is a visible difference. A hydrating, oil free formulation which I think is suitable for all skin types. The smell is slightly sweet but otherwise neutral. As usual, one of those “single-use” sachets is enough for at least three applications. It’s currently not a permanent part of my routine, but I use it whenever my skin gets irritated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Schaebens Augen & Lippen Maske**\n\nINCI: AQUA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, DIISOSTEAROYL POLYGLYCERYL-3 DIMER DILINOLEATE, GLYCERIN, CERA ALBA, ZINC STEARATE, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, CITRUS LIMON PEEL OIL, GLYCINE SOJA OIL, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA WATER, PANTHENOL, RETINYL PALMITATE, TOCOPHEROL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, UBIQUINONE, ALCOHOL, BENZOIC ACID, CITRAL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE, LACTIC ACID, LIMONENE, MAGNESIUM SULFATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, SORBIC ACID\n\nPrice 0.60€ for 4x1.5ml, available at DM, Rossmann\n\nThis is the only product with essential oils that I put on my face. It works surprisingly well for my sensitive skin. Even though it is advertised as an eye-and–lip mask and the instructions say to take it off after 10 mins., I use it as an overnight leave on mask for my whole face.\n\nIn the morning my skin feels plump and well hydrated. The mask reduces very fine lines overnight. Not permanently of course, but the effect does last at least a day for me.\n\nWhen I use this mask everyday my pores start to clog up after a while, so I make sure to not use it too frequently. 2 or 3 times a week is completely fine though. It’s also super cheap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Current Routine**\n\n**AM**\n\n\\-wash face with water\n\n\\- moisturizer: either TO NMF or Dermaveel\n\n\\- on cold days:  Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme\n\n\\- sunscreen: Dado Sens  Sun Sonnencreme SPF 30\n\n**PM**\n\n\\- Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch\n\n\\- one of the following:\n\n* TO NMF\n* TO LA 5% + TO NMF\n* Timeless HAC Serum + TO NMF\n* Manuka Repair Creme + TO NMF\n* Schaebens Augen und Lippen Maske as leave on overnight mask on whole face",

    "body": "**Review (Long Term Usage; 1+ years)** I have been using a few CeraVe products for more than an year. Putting down all the reviews at one place.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/21mqpuxa4p7c1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6152cd7496bcfdc6354819d50cab1872dd769b28\n\n**About me**: 25 F; I have combination skin with an oily T zone in summers and dry cheeks and nose in winters. I don't like strong fragrance in products, and I stay away from DIYs\n\n**Skin concerns**: Cystic acne; scars, hyperpigmentation *and* *crying* from the cystic acne\n\nAccording to the brand, All CeraVe products are formulated to be fragrance-free.\n\n*Category 1: Cleansers*\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cream-to-Foam Cleanser**\n\nTexture: Just like its described. It’s a creamy lotion texture out of the bottle. When you add water to it, it foams up and washes off like any other foaming cleanser. No noticeable fragrance.\n\nApplication: I use it two ways. First, if I want to take off any light makeup I rub it all over my dry face and it melts makeup off, then I add water it it and cleanse. Second way, I use it as a regular cleanser taking a pump in palm adding water to it and rubbing it all over my face, washing it off with water\n\n**10/10. Excellent. No notes. HG**. Already on 6th bottle. **WRP Forever**.\n\nIngredients AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, SODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE, COCO-BETAINE, SODIUM COCOYL ISETHIONATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, PCA, PPG-5-CETETH-20, PEG-100 STEARATE, PEG-150 PENTAERYTHRITYL TETRASTEARATE, PEG-6 CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC GLYCERIDES, PEG-30 DIPOLYHYDROXYSTEARATE, CI 77891 / TITANIUM DIOXIDE, ASPARTIC ACID, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, CARBOMER, GLYCOL DISTEARATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, GLYCERYL OLEATE, GLYCINE, TRIDECETH-6, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, THREONINE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, SALICYLIC ACID, SODIUM PCA, SODIUM LACTATE, ARGININE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SERINE, SODIUM BENZOATE, VALINE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, PROLINE, ISOLEUCINE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, ALANINE, PHENYLALANINE, COCONUT ACID, COCO-GLUCOSIDE, CHLORPHENESIN, DISODIUM EDTA, HYDROXYETHYL UREA, CITRIC ACID, HYDROXYETHYL ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, HISTIDINE, ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, POLYQUATERNIUM-53, POLYQUATERNIUM-39, POLYSORBATE 60, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZOIC ACID\n\n**CeraVe** **Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser (4% Benzyl Peroxide)**\n\nTexture: Translucent lotion-y texture, It’s runnier than the Cream to foam cleanser. Foams up well on wet face.\n\nApplication: It’s a wash off BP product. I use it 2x a week. I apply on face, neck and underarms. I leave it on for 5min and wash it off with water. I think it works better this way. If I leave it on for too long it does dry out my skin.\n\nI use it as a body wash too. It helped me with active acne on my face and back. I find it Better than other BP bodywashes and facewashes I tried. It doesn’t strip my skin. I do use a thick moisturiser after this.\n\n**9/10**. I cut one point for the packaging; It leaked on a flight once. **WRP**\n\nIngredients BENZOYL PEROXIDE 4%\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENTS: WATER, GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, COCAMIDOPROPYL HYDROXYSULTAINE, SODIUM C14-16 OLEFIN SULFONATE, XANTHAN GUM, POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, NIACINAMIDE, GLYCOLIC ACID, SODIUM CHLORIDE, SODIUM CITRATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, PROPANEDIOL, CITRIC ACID, TETRASODIUM EDTA, DIETHYLHEXYL SODIUM SULFOSUCCINATE, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZOIC ACID\n\n*Category 2: Serum*\n\n**CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum**\n\nTexture: Off-white runny lotion texture. Spreads easily. Not sticky, layers well under other products in my routine. No added fragrance.\n\nApplication: I started with using it twice a week and built up to every day. I use the sandwich method and layer between essence and a moisturizer. I don’t like it. It didn’t do anything for me. I noticed no difference in my skin except a slight smoothing effect. I find it to be a non-offensive beginner retinol.\n\n**5/10**. Excellent packaging. All Retinol products should come in a pump like this. **WNRP**\n\nIngredients: AQUA/WATER/EAU, PROPANEDIOL, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), CETEARYL ETHYLHEXANOATE, NIACINAMIDE, AMMONIUM POLYACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE, DIPOTASSIUM GLYCYRRHIZATE, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, DIMETHICONOL, LECITHIN, SODIUM CITRATE, RETINOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, ALCOHOL, ISOPROPYL MYRISTATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, CITRIC ACID, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\n*Category 3: Moisturizers*\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturising Lotion**\n\nTexture: Super light gel cream texture. Applies like a dream on my skin. No noticeable fragrance.\n\nApplication: I apply it after Hada Labo lotion. Used it throughout summer, great stand alone moisturizer. It was the only niacinamide product I was using at the time. I don’t like it for colder weather as my skin becomes drier. Excellent in hot weather at night. Helps oil control and the usual niacinamide things. It might feel heavy if you have super oily skin.\n\n**10/10.** No Nonsense night moisturizer in a pump bottle!!! **WRP**.\n\nIngredients : AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, NIACINAMIDE, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), CETEARETH-20, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, POLYGLYCERYL-3 DIISOSTEARATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\n**CeraVe Moisturizing Cream (White Tub)**\n\nTexture: Thick and gooey. The only CeraVe product that has a strange plastic/fevicol smell. The brand says there is no added fragrance so maybe it's just me. \n\nApplication: Applies smooth. Feels super super heavy on my face. I could just feel it sitting heavy on my skin. It didn’t give me any CCs. I used the rest of the tub as a body moisturizer. Great as a body moisturizer.\n\n**4/10.** The tub packaging too is disappointing. **WNRP.**\n\nIngredients: AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, CETEARETH-20, [PETROLATUM](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/petrolatum), POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, TOCOPHEROL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\nSorry for any mistakes. Let me know if I've missed any points. I'm new to reviews and English is hard.\n\nIf you have any questions about the products, please do ask.",

YMMV. not repurchasing.\n\n**Human Nature Ceramide Skin-renewing Night Cream**\n\nIngredients:\n\n[*Aqua (Water)*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water)*,* [*Glycerin*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin)*,* [*Cetearyl Alcohol*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol)*,* [*Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil)*,* [*Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/simmondsia-chinensis-seed-oil)*,* [*Glyceryl Stearate Citrate*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate-citrate)*,* [*Isoamyl Laurate*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/isoamyl-laurate)*,* [*Ceramide NP*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ceramide-np)*,* [*Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/aloe-barbadensis-leaf-juice)*,* [*Glyceryl Caprylate*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-caprylate)*,* [*Gluconic Acid*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/gluconic-acid)*,* [*Hydrolyzed Jojoba Esters*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-jojoba-esters)*,* [*Sclerotium Gum*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sclerotium-gum)*,* [*Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylic-capric-triglyceride)*,* [*Dicaprylyl Ether*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dicaprylyl-ether)*,* [*Tocopherol*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tocopherol)*,* [*Citric Acid*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid)*,* [*Sodium Citrate*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate)*,* [*Fragrance*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum)*,* [*Potassium Sorbate*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate)*,* [*Sodium Benzoate*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate)\n\nused this on the first 2 weeks of october, only at night, and my skin was at its best. i pair it with retinol and rest nights. did not give me new pimples. been using it again since the weekend and the new blemishes have started going away esp some fresh red marks.\n\ni personally think the formulation is oily skin and clog-prone friendly. it's a lightweight cream with wide spreadability and dries down quickly. if fragrance is a personal ick or your skin is sensitive then steer clear from this. it smells like bubble gum. i personally don't find a problem with it though. will definitely repurchase it!",

For example, in a shampoo with the ingredient list mentioned below, how would Dimethicone and sodium laureth sulfate behave?

        "body": ">Conventional shampoo technology using anionic surfactants and cationic conditioners results in charge interaction and complexing of he ingredients. Neither shampoo nor conditioner achieves the desired result. The successful solution was to incorporate charge neutral dimethicone conditioning ingredients, suspended as microfine droplets within complex crystal lattices, into anionic surfactant shampoo technology. The same solultion has also been applied to amphoteric surfactant systems. This provides complete cleaning, and hair conditioning fully equal to separate conditioners without the problems of build-up. This was achieved by keeping the dimethicone in suspension throughout the shampoo process. During rinsing, excess water breaks the crystalline lattice and allows deposition of the dimethicone droplets onto the hair. Full cleaning and conditioning are, therefore, achieved in one application. Dimethicone build-up is not encountered as subsequent washes first remove soil and previously deposited dimethicone. Neither do neutral dimethicones show any interactions with sebum. \n\n[(Rushton, Gummer & Flasch, 1994)](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/211278)\n\nOne of the authors is affiliated with Proctor and Gamble.\n\nAs to why it doesn't appear to leave build up, the same article states that \"no significant shift compared to untreated hair was found showing that dimethicone does not build-up on the hair surface with continued washing\" and that \"the level of dimethicone deposited onto virgin hair was found to plateau after 5 washes...and remained constant for in excess of 50 washes.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> since shampoo is primarily focused on the scalp does the silicone deposit on it? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure, but I would guess that it might. Silicones are used in skincare though, so I am not sure why that would be a concern:\n\n>The major drawback to pure petrolatum as a moisturizer is its greasiness, which most patients find unaesthetic. This can be minimized by lowering the petrolatum concentration and adding dimethicone, known as an astringent moisturizer,to improve product aesthetics. **Dimethicone is the second most common active agent in moisturizers today** because it too is hypoallergenic, noncomedogenic, and nonacnegenic.4 Dimethicone is one of a family of silicones that form the basis of all oil-free moisturizers and facial foundations......Dimethicone can provide many other skin benefits as an active agent besides moisturization. It can function as an emollient, making the skin smooth and soft to the touch by filling in spaces between the desquamating corneocytes.\n\n(emphasis mine)\n\n[(Draelos, 2010)](https://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/Abstract/2010/02000/Active_Agents_in_Common_Skin_Care_Products.38.aspx)",

This was my first sunscreen I bought after leaning about photoaging! My first baby! And we were off to a good start. It’s a white watery gel-like texture, light weight, invisible, but quite shiny (some might call this a dewy finish, but I prefer a skin-like finish). A good poster child for the typical Asian sunscreen, I guess. It is not water resistant, and you'll notice this as you sweat throughout the day: It’s like your sweat becomes heavier since it mixes with the sunscreen (you can’t see this of course, but it sure feels like it). I was also worried about touching my face throughout the day, because I felt I might rub the sunscreen off. I can’t remember it ever stinging my eyes, but I’m not entirely sure. The biggest drawback for me was the prize and how inaccessible it is in my country. At this point in time, I also hadn’t learnt about the proper amount of sunscreen you have to use, so I was probably underapplying, and the sunscreen can therefore have appeared lighter-textured in my memory. It contains a lot of fragrance and many ingredients, in general, so that could be irritating. A little bit of science: If you look at the UV filters, there are several UVB filters; many UVB (290-320 wavelength/nm) filters also “bleed into” and filter some UVA II (320-340) as well. The Uvinul A plus filters both UVA II and I (340-400), but it’s also the only UVA filter in this sunscreen, and it’s also the last ranking UV filter on the ingredient list, even though I’ve read that the upper limit for Uvinul A plus is 10% (of the total product). So, is there enough UVA protection? I don’t know, but it’s probably okay since the Pa is four pluses, so I wouldn’t worry too much about it. Packaging is nice and it has a pump, and you get 75 ml, not only the standard 50 ml.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Avène Hydrance OPTIMALE UV RICHE Rich hydrating cream**\n\n* \\- **SPF 20, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **40 ml/1.35 Fl.OZ**\n* \\- **Probably suitable for darker skin tones**\n* \\- **France**\n* \\- **Ingredients:** AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA).

It does not have high enough UV protection, and it is not designed to be used as a sunscreen, and therefore you will end up underapplying. I bought it because I was looking for a day cream at the time. I wanted something for my dry skin and this day cream worked in that regard. But never did I ever apply close to the amount of sunscreen you have to apply to get the labelled SPF and UVA protection. It is on the heavier side, so applying a quarter teaspoon to your face would not feel nice. Trust me. And even then, you’d only get SPF 20. I would not recommend anyone to use this product as a daily SPF product. It also contains fragrance even though it says it’s suitable for sensitive skin.\n* \\- **Score:** 2/5\n\n**NIVEA SUN UV FACE ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS SPF 30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

I must have gone though three of these. It has a lot in common with the MAKE P:REM one, and it also shares some of the same problems. It has a similar texture: white watery-gel, which turns translucent on top of the skin. It’s like a glycerine-rich moisturiser. I think it’s less shiny as well – more skin-like finish. The problem arises when you sweat: your sweat starts feeling even heavier than normal. I think I experienced some eye stinging with this sunscreen (nothing major), largely caused by it not being water resistant. It’s important to note that the reason it is so cosmetically elegant is also why it’s not water resistant. I was also scared to touch my face and accidently rub it off while wearing this one, too. It’s smells like sunscreen. If you’ve ever purchased a NIVEA sunscreen, you’ll know what I mean. And the fragrance doesn’t go away immediately either. My biggest problem at the time, was also that I wanted to find a SPF 50 sunscreen, and this one is only SPF 30. I think I’ve recently seen a SPF 50 version of this since, so if you live in Europe, I guess it’s worth giving it a shot. Looking at the ingredient list now, I see that it contains a lot of avobenzone. Avobenzone has a bad rep, but you cannot deny how effectively it protects against UVA when photostable. Avobenzone on its own is not photostable and will start degrading (and be used up) when exposed to the sun or UV light. In this sunscreen, however, (and most non-American sunscreens) it has been stabilised by another UV filter: In this case by Tinosorb S. I think this sunscreen might have much higher UVA protection than the EU requirement, which makes sense since it’s advertised as “ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS”.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Piz Buin Ultra Light Dry Touch Face Fluid SPF 30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Sweat and water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

This sunscreen survived me walking all around Madrid for a week in the middle of summer. Boom. What a trooper. The texture is a thick liquid, not a cream, so the opening is narrow so you can pour some into your hand or tilt your head backwards and pour it directly on your face. It dries to an almost powdery finish – it truly is dry touch. If you have dry skin, you should probably moisturise beforehand. It was also easy enough to reapply when I was out and about in Madrid; So, layering it wasn’t a chore. If you don’t apply it evenly it might dry down with some flakes even – that’s how dry it is. But I didn’t feel like it dried out my skin in the process, but that is of course a very personal observation. I would have been perfect if it was SPF 50, a little less expensive, and fragrance free. If you’ve ever tried a Piz Buin sunscreen, you’ll recognise their trademark fragrance at once: masculine and sunscreen-like. It does bring back good memories of summer and beaches for me personally, though.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**THE BODY SHOP Vitamin E Day Lotion SPF30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

I could barely open them in broad daylight, and I had to go back home and wash my face to get it off. Do not, under any circumstances apply this close to your eyes.

I have very pale skin (and am therefore really scared of “universal tints”), but it blended perfectly into my skin tone, perhaps with the slightest bit of coverage. Since it’s a mineral sunscreen, I’m sceptical if it’ll blend into darker skin, even with the tint, so that’s something to keep in mind. It might also have photo flashback, you have been warned. Even though it is silicone based, I wouldn’t describe it as “silicone-y”, if you know what I mean; it has a skin like finish. However, I don’t think I ever applied enough of it to truly know what its finish is like… First and foremost: the packaging. When I bought it, they still used a dropper – I repeat a dropper. This did not work, as the product would spill over, clump up at the inner edges of the bottle’s mouth, etc. And since it clumped up at the sides, I honestly don’t know if I’ve lost some of the UV protection of the product, since it’s no longer a completely homogenous liquid. They later changed the dropper to a pump, but it’s still embarrassing that they ever sold it with a dropper. What were they thinking? You also spend quite a bit of time applying it evenly on your skin, due to its consistency and tint. You kind of have to apply it like a foundation. Since it’s only 30 ml, it means that you should be finishing one of these in less than a month – and only if you’re just applying it to your face. At least it doesn’t have any fragrance! It does have an iffy smell to it, which goes away. Taking into consideration the cost, the packaging (even though it has improved) the fact that it’s not a SPF 50, PA++++ product, you’re left with a very mediocre sunscreen. It could however serve as a daily serum on top of your sunscreen, if you’re very extra.\n* \\- **Score:** 3/5\n\n**Altruist Dermatologist Sunscreen SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

With the EU’s regulation of UVA protection (in a nutshell the UVA protection has to be 1/3 of the SPF), you could, in theory, end up with SPF 30 sunscreens that had higher UVA protection than your SPF 50 sunscreen. And as a consumer, you simply wouldn’t know the difference. Anyway, Altruist SPF 50, has perfect UV protection, and no fragrance and such. In theory it’s the perfect sunscreen. I mean, look at all those filters (seriously why are there so many, did the chemists make a bet or something?) But in practice? Not so much. First and foremost, if you have darker skin, this might leave a white cast due to the titanium dioxide. Some people have mentioned this in their reviews and some people have also mentioned it stinging their eyes (I can’t remember noticing this). Secondly, the reason I didn’t like it, is because of the texture. It’s the same sort of texture as the MAKE P:REM and NIVEA mentioned above, just less cosmetically elegant. I thought it would dry down or sink into my face, but it never did. I would wait for 20 minutes, and I would still be sticky and a little bit shiny. What worked was putting a lot of translucent powder on top, then I would finally achieve a more skin like finish. Pro tip: Translucent powder can actually make most sunscreens bearable. Since it didn’t dry down, I felt as I would rub it off if my face touched anything. Maybe this sunscreen would work for people with dry skin? Since applying this sunscreen, waiting, applying powder, would take such a long time, I ended up just using a different sunscreen. And I guess that says it all. It also has a “chemical” smell to it, but that didn’t bother me. It might not have worked for my face, but it’s still a good sunscreen for the rest of the body.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Skinnies Sungel SPF30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, broad spectrum, PA++++ (PPD 16+)**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

This sunscreen utilises a new technology called Organogel™. It contains no water, and thus it doesn’t have to dry down, and you only need 1/5 the amount of a normal sunscreen. You heard that right: 1/5! So, you only need a pea-sized amount for your entire face! But I used a little bit more than that, because real peas are actually very small, so when people say pea-sized, they usually mean 2-3 real peas. A photo from their website illustrating what they meant by pea-sized confirmed my suspicion. But it’s still a very small amount! The texture is that of a see-through slightly orange-y gel. It’s oily, but it doesn’t move on your skin (also when you sweat). And it’s completely see-though so I can with confidence say it’ll suit every skin tone. It doesn’t completely dry down, though, but it does seem to sink into your skin a little bit, if you wait a couple of minutes. You can feel the gel on your skin when you touch it, but you wouldn’t notice you had anything on otherwise. Since it isn’t water based it also feels sturdier than the others I’ve tried, so I wasn’t as scared of it rubbing off when touching my skin. I think it might work very well as a primer. It has a slight “chemical” smell, it also doesn’t contain any perfume or any nonsense like that. It’s on the pricier side, but one 100ml bottle is actually the equivalent of 500ml of normal sunscreen, when you think about it, so I think the prize is justifiable. This was the sunscreen I kept on using when the Altruist one wasn’t working for me, by the way. It’s definitely the quickest sunscreen to apply of all the sunscreens I’ve ever used. A con is that is a little bit difficult to gauge if you are using enough, and that you’ve applied it evenly. Turns out there are two versions of this sunscreen: An American one and a New Zealand one. I somehow ended up with the American one, and it has worked just fine for me. The NZ version uses non-FDA approved filters, but it still has the same UVB and UVA protection listed, but I would still recommend you buy the NZ version, since there must be a reason why they chose to not just use the same formulation as the American one, right? Since I bought my bottle, they have also released many new products, like an SPF 50+. If the SPF 50+ behaves the same way as this one, I think I might have given it a score of 5/5. But keep in mind that it does not have a dry-touch finish (more of an immovable oily finish), but at least it has a sturdy one.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**The Balm BALMSHELTER TINTED MOISTURIZER (Shade: Lighter Than Light)**\n\n* \\- **SPF 18, broad spectrum**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **64 ml/ 2.15 Fl.

Note that this tinted moisturiser is much lighter than any of The Balm’s other products labelled “Lighter Than Light”. It’s really is a pale shade (it appears darker before you spread it over your skin), and it blends perfectly into my skin: I’ve never seen a tinted moisturiser or BB cream this fair before. However, it is so sheer, that the tint almost doesn’t matter. A little goes a long way, and that’s why you shouldn’t really use BB creams, tinted moisturisers and foundation as UV shields. I intended on using this on top of my sunscreen, but since it has next to none coverage, I never find myself reaching for it. If you’re pale as I am, and you want to experience the novelty of owning a tinted moisturiser, this is a good pick. No fragrance, and I haven’t used it close to my eyes.\n* \\- **Score: 2/5**\n\n**La Roche-Posay ANTHELIOS SHAKA ULTRA-LIGHT SPF 50+**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50+, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), PPD 42**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

This sunscreen was bought in Europe. America/Canada/Australia/Asia might have a different version of this sunscreen, because of the country’s different restrictions on UV filters and sunscreen criteria (especially American sunscreens). These versions are not always equal, both in UV protection and cosmetic elegance. It also turns out that I have bought two versions of this sunscreen: A new and an older version. I actually bought the newest version first – and I loved it. I couldn’t understand how people hated it (the skincare community is very split when it comes to the Shaka fluid). Of course, everyone’s skin is difference and can have a lot to say on how a sunscreen feels and behaves on the skin. It’s a fluid, so you have to shake it thoroughly. It takes a little bit longer to apply, since it’s a fluid. It dries down matte, and you can’t see that you’re wearing anything. Easy peasy. Its biggest downfall is the prize (I bought it on sale) and that it only comes in a tiny 50ml, so you can’t buy it in bulk, so to speak. But this was the newest version (as of this year)… and then I ended up accidently buying the older version online (which might still be in production?), and oh boy, was that a different experience! Not dry-touch, but oily! They looked so similar, but I instantly felt the difference on my face, because it didn’t dry down. Absolutely horrible in comparison, I felt so gross. You can tell the new version from the old from the packaging: The newest version has “ANTI-OXYDANT” written underneath the “UVB + UVA” text. It has a similar texture as the Piz Buin mentioned above, but I personally think the Piz Buin is superior in texture: even more dry-touch. But the shaka outshines almost all sunscreens in terms of UVB and UVA protection, and it doesn’t have any irritating fragrance to boot. I thought this would be my final HG sunscreen, because it couldn’t get any better in terms of UV protection and cosmetic elegance.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5 (new “ANTI-OXYDANT” version, 2019) (old version: 4/5, because it still has great UV protection, okay?)\n\n**EVY TECHNOLOGY SUNSCREEN MOUSSE SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I found it. Perfect texture, high UV protection, and relatively affordable. It also comes in a 100 ml bottle, not a 50 ml, which I appreciate. According to EVY, their sunscreens work differently than other sunscreens, because they don’t lay on top of your skin and form a film, but instead they sink into the skin (stratum corneum, I presume). Because of this, they’re very water resistant and sturdy. You shake the bottle, turn it upside down, and squeeze out a golf ball-sized blob of mousse. (This mousse holds its shape pretty well and you can play with it.) Then I just rub the mousse into my face: first it turns into a light-weight white cream… and then it disappears into the skin. After a couple of minutes, there is no trace of it, but if I’ve applied to much there might be some stickiness. It certainly feels like it sinks into the skin, because it’s very hydrating. The other sunscreens I’ve liked, I’ve liked for their dry-touch finish, but with EVY I don’t need to worry about it, because I can’t feel it on my face when I touch (well, technically my face feels like it’s been hydrated) and it doesn’t do anything when I sweat. A Youtuber reviewed EVY and said that the Boots star system is only marketing – it’s not. While we have a universal measurement of UVB: SPF, we’ve later realised that UVA also causes skin damage and cancer, but we still haven’t been able to agree on one universal measurement or requirement. The Boots Star Rating system with a maximum of 5 stars requires much higher UVA protection than the European Recommendation, where the UVA protection only needs to be 1/3 of the SPF. Gothamista, however, really liked EVY. It has no fragrance, but a light aerosol smell that goes away. Because of the packaging, no preservatives are needed. It also contains some antioxidants. I’m already on my third bottle of EVY, and I will continue to purchase it in the future.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5\n\nSome sunscreens I’ve heard good things about and might want to try one day: Anessa sunscreens, Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50 PA ++++, Ultrasun sunscreens, Bioderma Photoderm Max Cream SPF50+.",

It has glycerin as a top ingredient, the same as Mac Fix+ which people use to \"foil\" or help shadows stay better.\n\nHope you enjoy! Just testing a theory! \n\n*DISCLAIMER AND WARNING*\n\nIdk if it's exactly eye proof. It says keep out of eyes, but you should really keep alot of crap out of your eyes. I use urban decay all nighter mixed with shadows and that says keep out of eyes. Also, if you use it as a primer, it could potentially get in your eye.\n\nSo.. FYI, don't squirt it in your eye unless you... Really want to?? \n\nI haven't used it on my eyes yet until I look at the ingredients a bit more thoroughly. I also am not advocating you to do so.

    "body": "Everyone’s talking about the skincare items for May’s Glam Bag X they all look very nice and high end.  Since I have nothing better to do I thought I would do some analyzing of the skincare items, will they actually do anything for your skin? Let’s have a look.  So far I think the ones we’ve all seen are: Herbivore Prism Mask, Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream, Rodial Pink Diamond Cleansing Balm, The Route Party Peel, Kopari CBD Balm.  There may be more skincare items but these are the ones that are confirmed. \n\nThe three most coveted items are easy to see, Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream, Herbivore’s Prism Mask and Rodial Cleansing Balm so I’ll focus my analysis on these 3 items since I happen to own all of them as well. \n\n- Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream RV $100\n\nHas the highest RV and I’m guessing most people are aiming for this, the packaging is gorgeous from the way you unbox the cream to the jar itself, makes a great gift.  Now onto the ingredients:\n\nWater, Homosalate (sunscreen filter), Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ethylhexyl Salicylate (sunscreen filter), Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane (Avobenzone, the only FDA approved sunscreen filter that has sufficient UVA protection, however it’s not stable hence why sunscreens has to be reapplied), Octocrylene (sunscreen filter) Cetyl Alcohol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Steareth-21, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Carbomer, Dimethiconol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Hydrolyzed Viola Tricolor Extract, Allantoin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Disodium Edta, Tocopheryl Acetate, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Sodium Hydroxide, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Michelia Alba Leaf Oil, Sodium Lactate, Coco-Glucoside, PEG-8, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Plumeria Rubra Flower Extract, Ascorbic Acid, Citric Acid, Nicotiana Sylvestris Leaf Cell Culture, Linalool, Citronellol, Geraniol.\n\nI know the label doesn’t mention this but this moisturizer actually has SPF15 and other UVA filters, most of the top ingredients are all sunscreen filters/stabilizers.  The sunscreen filters that are in the moisturizer are mostly weak ones or are in low concentration like Avobenzone, so this wouldn’t be my sunscreen pick for going out in the sun.  \n\nThen there are the usual occlusive ingredients like silicones and other ingredients which will give the skin a silky smooth finish, of course having Shea Butter gives it a more thicker texture, most of the ingredients that can’t be pronounced are common preservatives/emulsifiers (ingredients that help water and oil mix properly so they don’t separate)/ingredients that help stabilize the formula, most of these ingredients are in normal moisturizers, you won’t find some of them in most “clean beauty” products, however there’s nothing unsafe/toxic about these ingredients which have been in cosmetics for a long time.  \n\nIn terms of beneficial ingredients for the skin, it’s got the common humectants like glycerin, dimethicone, butylene glycol, hyaluronic acid, aloe vera, that attract and hold onto moisture.  Besides the oat kernel extract and Shea butter most of the other ingredients like rose hip oil, cameilla seed oil, sunflower seed oil, etc aren’t in high enough concentrations for the skin to derive any nutrients from them but they accomplish the task of softening the skin.  The BioNymph peptide that’s talked about the description of the cream is “Nicotiana Sylvestris Leaf Cell Culture”, fairly new ingredient it’s a natural peptide, can’t find any studies on it besides the ones coming from the manufacturer.  Obviously those studies show it’s magic protects the skin against anything oh and it also diminishes wrinkles in 2 weeks....sure.  \n\nFinal thoughts on the product: I bought it because of the hype and nice packaging, it does accomplish what a moisturizer is suppose to do, trap and prevent the loss of moisture, most people expect too much from their moisturizers IMO and that’s why companies are creating ridiculous ingredients like bioNymph peptide in order to look special.  I think this moisturizer was originally suppose to be a makeup primer with higher SPF protection but they couldn’t stabilize the Avobenzone, cos it’s a very tricky sunscreen filter and also the ingredients at the top all seem to be suggest this would be a more lightweight product in terms of texture.  The last part of the cream with all the thickening and beneficial ingredients for skin almost came as an after thought.  It’s fairly scented, the last 3 ingredients are all fragrance, but I don’t mind scented products and enjoy the way this smells.  It’s not as heavy as most of my other moisturizers since I have dry skin and like super thick creams. Most people will likely use this at night but I wonder if it’s okay to sleep with sunscreen filters....\n\n- Herbivore Prism Mask RV $58\n\nIngredients list: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit/Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Salix Nigra (Willow) Bark Extract, leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Populus Tremuloides Bark Extract, Gluconolactone, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Sodium Phytate.\n\nMy analysis copied from a reply:\n\n“I have the Herbivore Prism Mask and Serum I bought both when I was still a newbie when it came to skincare ingredients/formulation.  Now that I’ve had to learn more about skincare cos of the constant crap we receive in beauty boxes, I would not recommend the Prism Mask. It uses “natural AHAs” we’ve all seen it before in other products like sugar cane extract, sugar maple extract (maple syrup, very Canadian), lemon extract etc. MANY of these “clean beauty brands” will treat these fruit extracts the same as glycolic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, etc. However they’re completely DIFFERENT!\n\nYes most AHAs are derived from fruit extracts like glycolic acid comes from sugar cane, tartaric and malic comes from maple syrup extract etc, however these acids has to be derived in a lab first, on it’s own these extracts has no PROVEN exfoliation abilities.  Maybe there’s a tiny bit of exfoliating action but because AHAs acids needs to be at the right pH level to work anywhere from pH of 2 to just under 4, from looking at the ingredients of the Prism Mask it’s definitely passed that pH (just a guess, maybe I’ll test the pH later). The closer an AHA exfoliating product gets to the pH of 2, the more free acid value it has. As an example everyone’s favourite lactic acid treatment Sunday Riley GG has only 5% concentration of lactic acid and yet why is it so effective and be loved? It’s because the pH of GG is just around 2.5ish (I tested it with pH strips and got values between 2 and 3 so I’ll just avg it out), at that pH level it can access almost all 5% of the lactic acid in the formula. As another example a product like Saturday Skin’s 10% Glycolic Acid Toner at first looks very promising but when tested the the pH level was between 5-6, making the 10% claim useless since acids can’t do much exfoliating at those pH levels, and the toner can’t access the 10% of glycolic acid and use it properly, making the free acid value basically zero.  When it comes to exfoliating products the percentage of acids doesn’t mean much, it’s all about the pH level and free acid value, if you look at Skinceutical’s Glycolic Overnight Cream on the packaging it doesn’t say this cream contains 10% glycolic acid but rather the free acid value is 10% glycolic.  \n\nAs for the 5% BHA claim, again it uses willow bark extract cos it’s a “clean natural” ingredient, Willow Bark extract contains salicin which only becomes salicylic acid when it’s orally ingested cos of the enzymes in our stomachs, I’m assuming no one wants to eat this mask. Salicylic acid is derived from willow bark extract in labs using a complicated process, thus when applied topically willow bark extract is actually a very good ingredient for inflammation, it soothes the skin, helps with redness etc. It’s good for the skin just not for exfoliating. Lastly the law prohibits any OTC product from having more than 2% salicylic acid (BHA), so these brands get around this by putting 5% BHA on the label hoping people will think 5% willow bark extract is the same as 5% salicylic acid, obviously they’re two completely different ingredients. It’s actually a very good hydrating mask though.”\n\nAlso forget to mention this has zero preservatives not even the new ones that are supposedly so much safer and not toxic, I guess the antibacterial properties of leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate can assist in preserving the product however I’m not a big fan of mold and bacteria so if you do receive this please make sure to check the batch code and when it was manufactured \n\n- Rodial Pink Diamond Cleansing Balm RV $59\n\nIngredients list: Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG-8 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Cetearyl Alcohol, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Germ Oil, Polysorbate 20, Glyceryl Dibehenate, Tribehenin, Glyceryl Behenate, Parfum (Fragrance), Tocopherol , Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Mica, Diamond Powder, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Geraniol, Limonene, Linalool, CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide), CI 75470 (Carmine)\n\nIt’s not really a balm texture, if you’re use to using those K beauty cleansing balms with the sherbet texture or the Farmacy one that will transform from balm/oil to milky emulsion this is different.  When it comes out of the tube it has a oil in gel texture, it removes all my makeup but I don’t wear heavy or waterproof makeup.  It’s heavily scented so maybe not the best for sensitive skin.  It washes off cleanly and comes with a muslin cloth, honestly there’s not too much to say about a cleanser.  I bought it cos I’m a sucker for pretty packaging, it’s nice that it’s in a tube so good for traveling/weekend trips, again the main draw back is the fragrance.\n\nTL:DR - they all make great gifts, as far as skincare benefits....meh.",

        "body": "I currently own the La Neige mask and I honestly don't find it very moisturizing. Someone in r/AsianBeauty mentioned that it's meant as the final step in an AB routine, meaning it is formulated to lock in multiple layers of hydration that you've put on earlier. So if you aren't doing the AB first treatment essence/hydrating toner/essence steps, you might not get the full benefit of it and despite me using an FTE and toner, I think that's definitely what I'm suffering from. I should also mention that I have normal/dry in winter skin, so I tend to need heavier moisture and occlusives.\n\nIf you have oily or combo skin, La Neige may provide the moisture you're looking for! If you're normal/dry, I'd recommend looking for something more intensive, because the La Neige mask might not meet your expectations, especially after using trentinoin.",

    "body": "So I recently bought the Avéne Tolerance Extreme Cleansing Cream and had been using it as a dayrime moisturizer (I also had a sample of the Tolerance Emulsion which is exactly the same except for the lack of Carbomer at the end of the ingredient list, they felt basically identical to me) and at first it seemed great for my super sensitive but also acne prone skin, no pore clogging ingredients, no preservatives, nothing irritating, perfect right? Well after a week or 2 I started to break out more around my chin and even on my nose where I don't usually break out. After a month I went back to my previous moisturizer (Eucerin Eczema Relief cream) which had caster oil in it (comedogenic level 2 ingredient) and the breakouts seem to be dying down... \n\nI always see Squalane listed as an almost perfect oil for our skin, is it possible to cause breakouts though? Just curious other people's experiences with it? Thanks!",

I got it for Rs. 575/-.\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Carbomer, Arginine, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, Disodium EDTA, Pentylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Tripeptide-1, Hexapeptide-9, Hexapeptide-11, Copper Tripeptide-1\n\n**My Skin Type:** Combination skin with an oily T-zone\n\n**Usage:** Since Past 6 months\n\n**My Experience:** I absolutely enjoyed using this toner for the past few months. Here's why, this has a lightweight texture, thicker than water but thinner than a serum/gel, that gets absorbed on your skin easily. My skin never felt sticky or greasy on application. It used to get absorbed within a few minutes, even when I mistakenly applied it excessively. \n\nIt's a very hydrating. Due to seasonal change, my skin had become very dry. Whenever I applied this toner, I instantly felt a calming effect on my skin, and it helped lessening the dryness for a while. Obviously it ain't enough as you need a hydrating Moisturizer to go along with it. \n\nThis one has fragrance, but it wasn't too overpowering. If you're someone who can tolerate a little fragrance, you'll be okay. \n\nMy favourite part is how easy it's on your pocket. The price might appear a bit high, but the quantity makes up for the price. As listed above, I've been using the toner since last 6 months daily, still 30-40% is left. \n\n**WRP:** Maybe Yes. Why Maybe? Coz I'm a victim of FOMO who wants to keep on trying new skincare items. If I'm able to stick to one product, I can see SNP toner becoming a part of my regular routine.\n\n**FINAL VERDICT:** A fantastic but underrated product.",

This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less 😖 if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation.

I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop 😭. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :( but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nrating : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uglx4tvptp691.jpg?width=3027&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1edc1b4cadce02af8a7cdc6b1c061b01ce3df5ce\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sjk70mlqtp691.jpg?width=3234&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9624dd3003686cc5cf39097b7f271e1643502dd5\n\n**ingredients list** :  Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/​PPG-10/​1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool 🤤 only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure!  in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty 😖 I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao 😌 so you can guess I go out a lot heheh. I feel like this one is getting over sooner than others in my ss ki theli 😫 but either way, if you find a good deal on it, blindly add this to your cart and order it. you wont be dissappointed!\n\nrating : 5/5 and WRP on reduced mrp only.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand that's all I have to share with you all today! there are so many other ss I want to try like the BOJ one and the Beplain nonnano one, but I want to finish my current stock before buying anymore! do feel free to ask any questions related in the comments and I hope you enjoyed reading these!",

I love physical sunscreens for indooors mainly due to the whitecast, I’ve been using the Neutrogena Sheer zinc for a while because it not only gives me a sun protection but also soothes my skin and reduces oil production. But the biggest drawback is it’s whitecast :/ and I totally get you when you mention the white cast around mouth. The Neutrogena one makes me looking like a ghost all day.",

    "body": "🦋 **Skin type:** Oily, slightly dehydrated\n\nSensitive (inflammation and acne-prone, malassezia/fungal acne, slow healing), ever present PIH+PIE\n\n🦋 **Climate:** Mumbai monsoon. Ranges from slightly cool to slightly warm, humid.\n\n🦋 **Current routine:**\n\nAM - Himalaya Neem Purifying face wash > \nDIY 15% vitamin C Serum in aloe base > \nEpisoft AC SPF30/Vilvah Melt-in-milk SPF30\n\nIdeally. In reality, I've been sick for the last couple months and just rinsing my face with water and not doing anything else. Only doing my PM routine, and very proud of it 😂\n\nPM - Himalaya Neem Purifying face wash > Aziderm gel 20% (prescription product) OR Minimalist 10% glycolic serum > wait ten minutes, then mist face with plain water (+ apply a drop of glycerin on Aziderm nights) > Nykaa SKINRX Ceramide Barrier Repair Deep Nourish Night Moisturizer for Oily Skin\n\n🦋 **Age:** Early 30s\n\n🦋 **Usage timeline:** From mid-June to mid-August, so two months. Two pumps for the face and neck, every night. Edit: just finished the product, so it lasts a little over two months with this usage... kinda fast, considering other moisturizers I've reviewed last longer 🤔\n\n#✨️Ingredient list: \nPurified Water, Methylpropanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Carbomer, Glycerin, CERAMIDE 1,2,3,4,6II, Lecithin, Oat Bran Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Gluconate, Glucono-Delta-Lactone, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Extract, White Tea Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Wheat Amino Acids, Soy Amino Acids, Arginine HCL, Serine, Threonine, Cetyl-PG Hydroxyehyl Palmitamide, Cholesterol, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nIt's only after I'd opened and used it once that I realized there's literally only water and methylpropanediol (solvent and preservative booster) above the 1% phenoxyethanol mark 🙃 So the \"deep nourish\" part of the product name... well, we'll get to that 😂\n\nNotably silicone-free, fragrance-free and fungal-safe.\n\n🦋 **Price:** MRP ₹449 for 50g, currently available for ₹315 (always at reduced price)\n\n#✨️Texture, consistency and fragrance\n\n[Texture and packaging shots here.](https://imgur.com/a/as3rro6) Fragrance-free.\n\nIt's a translucent white gel-cream that is not particularly hydrating. Absorbs fast and doesn't leave a feeling of residue or coating. Definitely lightweight ✅️ You can see it holds it's shape when pumped out, and isn't at all runny. Spreads easily on damp skin (2 pumps covers face and neck), but not so much on totally dry skin. I wouldn't reccomend using it on totally dry skin, because as I said. It doesn't add any hydration to speak of.\n\nThe Chemist at Play 1% Salicylic moisturizer ([my review here](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/SCXCQY8NP4)), for example, is also a gel-cream, but thicker. That one does give a feeling of a slight barrier on the skin, the Nykaa one doesn't. \n\nIn that sense, it leaves a similar unnoticeable film to the One Thing Centella Soothing cream ([my review here](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/WHL98iN3am)), but is _even_ less hydrating (the One Thing product is also a gel-cream, and also not particularly hydrating). \n\nIt's not at all like a water gel/aloe vera gel, or \"water-bomb\" gel moisturizers like the Neutrogena Hydroboost. Those are all more hydrating. Hope all the comparisons give you some context ☺️\n\n🦋 Packaging - an airless pump bottle with nozzle and cover. Lightweight, easy to use and dispenses well 👍🏼\n\n#✨️Effects\n\nIt sinks in quickly and leaves a totally imperceptible effect afterwards. No residue, no stickiness, no coating feeling... feels like you didn't apply anything 😂 BUT, it does perform as a moisturizer. Prevents dehydration etc. So for people with truly oily skin, it's actually a much appreciated effect! \n\nDoesn't have any visible soothing effects that I noticed - but my skin is well-managed, even the sensitivity. Barrier products don't show dramatic results on healthy skin, so products like this one and the One Thing Centella Soothing cream are hard to review 😅 \n\n#✨️My experience and final thoughts\n\nIt does contain all the good ceramides and percentage is waaay low, as are all the other beneficial ingredients. But they don't need to be high up to have the intended effect. Whether or not they do... your guess is as good as mine 🤷🏽‍♀️ The product didn't break me out, and served it's purpose - to provide light moisturization.\n\nI was initially really annoyed when I tried it though 😂 It's the marketing terms they used! \"Deep nourish\" and \"night cream\". I would expect a product with a _little_ more thickness (even for a gel-cream) and SOME hydration if it's supposed to be those things. So the product itself I like, but I don't think it lines up that well with some of the terms they use. Like, this isn't a \"night cream\"  by any stretch of the imagination. It's a gel-cream moisturizer you can use at night. \n\nIf I needed extra moisture (on my non-AHA nights), I did have to use a drop of glycerine after spraying my face with water. Otherwise my skin would be slightly dehydrated in the morning. Considering that's in humid weather, this moisturizer is no way gonna be enough in winter 🤔 \n\nPeople with even slightly dehydrated skin will probably need to use some type of hydrating product underneath this. MAY work for combo skin in really hot weather, but again, isn't gonna give you hydration, just very light occlusion. \n\nAll in all, a solid product. Works for the target demographic. Would reccomend for oily-skinned people like me, who find that moisturizer often breaks them out.\n\n🦋 **Repurchase status:**\n\nI'd rate it a 4.5/5. WRP.\n\nAlthough I always try something new, and intend to try the Sebamed Face Care Gel next. Docking 0.5 points for not living up to marketing terms - my expectations were SO off from the reality 😂 But after actually using it awhile I realized the product itself is good.\n\nIt's more affordable and accessible than the One Thing Centella soothing cream, and I'd actually consider it kind of a dupe... if it was a teeny bit more hydrating 🙃 Very similar in utility, at least. \n\nHope this was interesting and/or helpful ☺️ Byee!\n\nEdit: the Nykaa SKINRX Hyaluronic Acid Hydra-X Night Moisturizer For Oily Skin is also a fungal-safe option I wanna try at some point - it has glycerin and MCT oil listed above phenoxyethanol, so I'm guessing it's a little more substantial. Not super intuitive to have a barrier product/\"night cream\" be lighter than a \"hydra-x\" product... but who knows, that one might be good, too!",

    "body": "So I've been testing this product over the past month, and since I haven't seen any other reviews of it I figured I would write one myself!\n\nI have combination skin with dry cheeks and an oily t-zone, and my skin is dehydrated from tret. I am very acne prone, and also very prone to PIH. I started using tret in november of last year, and had 5-6 weeks of purging consisting of cystic acne on both cheeks, which resulted in pretty bad PIH. My persistent acne has since cleared up, but I still get random spots that pop up here and there, and they usually end up in PIH regardless of whether or not I picked at it. For reference, here is my full routine:\n\nFANCL mild cleansing oil (PM)   \nCosrx low ph cleanser  \nEpiduo (AM)  \nCosrx bha liquid (PM)    \n.025% tretinoin (PM)  \nMissha FTE Intensive  \nMuji light toning water  \nNR white vita capsule essence    \nNR snail solution emulsion  \nCosrx honey sleeping pack  \n\nBoth the Missha FTE and the NR emulsion contain niacinamide, but they didn't make a significant difference in fading my PIH, which is why I decided to try out the capsule essence. For some reason, I can't find the product on the nature republic website right now, but when I last checked the site it states that the product contains 5% niacinamide! The product packaging also states 5%. The other products in the white vita line, if I remember correctly, contain 2%.  \n\n\n**Edited to add** Ingredients: Water, Niacinamide (5%), Methylpropanediol, Betaine, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Piper Methysticum Leaf/Root/Stem Extract, Phellinus Linteus Extract, Articum Lappa Root Extract, Pancratium Maritimum Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Extract, Nymphaea Alba Flower Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Tranexamic Acid, Panthenol, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Gelatin, Carbomer, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Tromethamine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-51, Glycosyl Trehalose, Glycerin, Cellulose Gum, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Raffinose, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Disodium EDTA, Lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Calcium Alginate, Agar, Gellan Gum, Propanediol, Acetic Acid, Dipropylene Glycol, Lactic Acid, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Zinc PCA, Sodium Palmitoyl Proline, Inositol, Bisabolol, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate, Bioflavonoids, Ascorbic Acid, Tocopherol, Hesperidin, Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate  \n\nThe essence is a clear, slightly runny gel. You can see tiny bead-like capsules in the bottle, but they aren't so noticeable when you pump out the product and apply it. It sinks in quickly and provides light hydration. There is a slight tackiness after it absorbs, but it goes away after I apply the rest of my routine. The essence does contain fragrance, but the scent is surprisingly very subtle and clean. I barely notice it, unlike with the other NR products I've used. Also the essence came in a set with mini versions of the white vita toner and emulsion (I don't think NR sells the essence by itself, although some other online sellers might). Unfortunately they both contain alcohol, which I am sensitive to, so I couldn't test those.\n\nSo, does the essence work? For me, yes! I've noticed that over the past few weeks, my PIH is fading much faster than usual. The stubborn marks all over my cheeks have become noticeably lighter. Now that the PIH is finally going away, I barely need to use concealer for them. I haven't introduced any other products over the past month, so for now I'm attributing the improvement to this essence. I'm hoping this improvement continues, and if it does, this essence might find a permanent spot in my routine.\n",

Also, except the fact that they used too many extracts/fragrances,  they use pretty safe stuffs like pentylene glycol and methypropanediol for solvents. Betaine is a nice moisturizer, and sodium hyaluronate and Argan are also added. Even though negligible amount, Retinyl Palmitate & Vitamin C is there as well. This is a serum with excellent ingredients. Amazing!!\nAgain, Thanks for sharing!! I would definitely go online, and order it. \n\nLove, \n\nRandy",

Re'equil one is available in only one size, 100gm for Rs 350.\n* *Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:* DAM- HG/WRP, RE'EQUIL: WNRP.\n\n**Experience:** \n\nHello all\n\nUsually I use lighter moisturiser but winters had me looking for an apt moituriser for my skin, since it gets dry and skin tends to become flaky. I was earlier using Simple Light moisturiser and Disguise Cosmetic's Sorbet, but both of these were proving insufficient for winters, hence decided to try DAM and Re'equil.\n\nAs you can see both of them have beautiful ingredients, though Re'equil one has fragrance (it is the last ingredient, the smell is mild and nice) while DAM is fragrance free.\n\nFor my skin type, I require a small amount of both of these  moisturisers. Though Re'equil is heavier- it is a cream albeit not a thick one, while DAM is lighter comparatively and has lotion like consistency.\n\nI started with using DAM during the morning routine. Needless to say, my skin did not feel dry at all. There was no need for reapplication either. It also did not react with my skin. So overall, I am very satisfied with this. Might this be love? Probably.\n\nRe'equil one I used in my PM routine. Now this moisturiser and I go long back because back in June, I got this for my younger sibling, who has a dry-dehydrated skin which is also prone to blackheads, whiteheads and acne. I wanted her to start looking after her skin a bit so I got her a bunch of products, one of which was this. It suited her nicely, though it is another matter altogether that she was never consistent with her routine. I guess skincare enlightenment has to occur on its own to a person for one to really get invested in it. Sigh. \n\nI also would use it occasionally then, and it did feel a little heavy on my combination skin so I decided to use it during winters. Cut to November, I started applying it in my nighttime routine. However after a couple of days, I could see some acne on my forehead. It probably clogged my pores. I stopped using it for some time, and the acne receded (my skin is not acne prone). I thought I should give it a try again, and once more I could see tiny acne on my forehead. I have since then decided to cut it off my routine. It is a great moisturiser, very nourishing. As mentioned, it works for my sister, but unfortunately it is not for me. \n\nRe'equil's finish is more matte, and it can be seen and felt immediately while DAM can feel slightly greasy on immediate application but sinks in fast and also provides a nice, smooth finish.\n\n**Conclusion**: So for the past one week, I have been using DAM in my AM as well as PM routine and I am more than satisfied. I think DAM is going to be my HG for winters atleast. Not sure how it is going to fare in summers, that remains to be seen. Hope this is helpful for folks looking for winter moisturisers. :)",

There's a lot of good info about the new formula on Stratia's Instagram but I'll recap some of it here.\n\n**Ingredient lists (Peptides/Growth Factors are in bold):**\n\n* Stratia Interface (Old Formula): Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Squalane, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Panthenol, Ethoxydiglycol, Propylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Rosa Mosqueta (Rose) Hip Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, **Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-27, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide-78, Palmitoyl Octapeptide-24, Copper Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-14, Heptapeptide-15 Palmitate**, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Lactic Acid/​Glycolic Acid Copolymer, Disodium EDTA, Polyacrylamide, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Tocopherol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Laureth-7, Diazolidinyl Urea, Xanthan Gum\n* Stratia Interface (New Formula): Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Squalane, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Panthenol, Ethoxydiglycol, Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Dimethicone, Rosa Mosqueta (Rose) Hip Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lecithin, Acetyl Glutamine, **Sh-Oligopeptide-1, Sh-Oligopeptide-2, Sh-Polypeptide-1, Sh-Polypeptide-9, Sh-Polypeptide-11, Copper Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-14, Heptapeptide-15 Palmitate**, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Allantoin, Bacillus/Folic Acid Ferment Filtrate Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lactic Acid/Glycolic Acid Copolymer, Disodium EDTA, Polyacrylamide, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Tocopherol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Laureth-7, Diazolidinyl Urea, Xanthan Gum\n* Drunk Elephant Protini: Water/Aqua/Eau, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Bacillus/ Folic Acid Ferment Filtrate Extract, Nymphaea Alba Root Extract, **sh-Oligopeptide-1, sh-Oligopeptide-2, sh-Polypeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-9, sh-Polypeptide-11, Copper Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-14, Heptapeptide-15 Palmitate, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Alanine, Arginine, Glycine, Histidine, Isoleucine, Phenylalanine, Proline, Serine, Threonine, Valine, Acetyl Glutamine, Coconut Alkanes, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Aspartic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Sodium Lactate, Sodium PCA, PCA, Sorbitan Isostearate, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, Polysorbate 60, Lactic Acid/Glycolic Acid Copolymer, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Isomalt, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Chlorphenesin, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, Sodium Benzoate, Phenylpropanol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Symphytum Officinale Callus Culture Extract.\n\n**General info + thoughts I have on comparisons between the two:**\n\n* Stratia reformulated Interface because some of the peptides in the old formulation were discontinued. According to their IG, they used this as an opportunity to upgrade the formula and have now incorporated a different mix of peptides and have also added growth factors (the ingredients that start with Sh-). This makes the formula quite similar to Protini, at a lower price point.\n* Comparisons:\n   * The two formulas now contain the same mix of growth factors, as well as Copper Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-14 and Heptapeptide-15 Palmitate. The main difference now between the two formulas is that Protini contains Matrixyl 3000 (Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1 and Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7), while Interface doesn't. Protini also has a diverse mix of amino acids in their formula (alanine, arginine, glycine, etc), while Interface does not.\n   * Stratia mentions that their peptides are \"encapsulated,\" which allows the Interface formula to be used alongside other actives (like Vit C, retinoids, acids, etc). Traditionally, from what I've read, peptides are finicky and work best on their own while not being used with other actives. Stratia says that their encapsulation technology allows Interface to be used at any time, and with any active. Protini does not claim any sort of encapsulation (to my knowledge).\n* I haven't tried the new Interface formula, but I have tried the old Interface formula as well as Protini. On IG, Stratia said that the new Interface formula texture should feel exactly like the old one, just with improved long-term benefits. Formula-wise, the old Interface feels a bit more lightweight than Protini. Neither are heavy-duty moisturizers and if you have dry skin, you may need to layer an oil or something heavier duty on top at night. In terms of differences in my skin - peptides/growth factors are more of a long-game, and in my experience, don't produce quick improvements in my skin that I can notice (like with AHAs or retinoids, for example). I use peptides because of their long-term benefits for the skin.\n\n**Questions I have:**\n\n* I'm wondering how much of an impact the \"encapsulation\" technology in Interface will truly make a difference in terms of it being able to be used with other actives - I'm not a product formulator so I'm not sure about the science behind this. At the moment, I avoid using peptides with any other active (I use them on nights when I'm taking a break from tret or acids). If the peptides in Interface truly are protected and can be used with actives (as Stratia claims on its website), then it truly is a game changer in terms of simplifying ones routine. Does anyone have more insight about encapsulation? Can peptides truly be \"protected\" from other actives?\n* Does the addition of amino acids in the Protini formula make a difference for anti-aging benefits?\n* Does anyone have experiences with the new Interface formula? Please share! :)\n\nFeel free to add any thoughts / info about these two products! Thanks everyone!",

I highly recommend typing her name next to protini in tiktoks search bar. It was a great help to me when I was trying to understand how this complex actually gets into the skin.",

First of all, there is so much sodium in it that it will actually over-cleanse your hair and leave it very dry — something I don’t recommend for anyone with textured hair or normal/dry skin conditions. If you have colored hair (highlights, single process, etc) DO NOT USE THIS. All the money you paid your stylist will go down the drain, as shampoos like this have pH levels way beyond the natural pH of our hair and skin, which can cause more harm than good.

    "body": "I've been lurking around in this sub for quite some time but I had yet to contribute to it. Now, the time comes. \n\n\nFirst of all, I'll tell y'all my skin type so you get an idea of how these two products may work on you. I have sensitive combination skin, it was originally very dry but with summer my T-zone is starting to get oily. I have a little fungal acne (self-identified though, I never went to pro for this) and rosacea type 1. I redden really easily and my veins show up, my skin breaks out easily at products or even... my computer or phone screen. I'm a computer science major. It's a review but if someone got some tips it'd be nice >>' \n\n\nLet's go for the review! \n\n\n**Muji Light Toning Water (High moisture)** \n\n* Ingredients: Water, DPG, glycerin, PEG-32, diglycerin, glycosyl trehalose, hydrolysis hydrogenated starch, hyaluronic acid Na, allantoin, grapefruit seed extract, polyquaternium -51, purslane extract, BG, phenoxyethanol, PCA-Na, Na-citrate , citric acid\n(Fragrance free, Non-staining, Mineral oil free, Mildly acidic, Paraben free, Alcohol free) \n\n* Packaging: Some may find it cheap/too simple but I like the minimalistic style! \n\n* Application: It feels like water, only a bit thicker. Because of that, it's very easy to apply with cotton, patting with the tips of your fingers or making a mask soaked with it. It's a pretty light product and my skin absorbs it quickly! The scent is pretty mild too. \n\n* Benefits: It does a good job at hydrating my skin without breaking it out and the pH is very close to the one of our's skin so it feels good after using a cleanser. It made my face plump and soft. \n\n* Price: It's affordable but I find it on the pricier side for a student without many resources (France's price). The benefits are there but they're 'WOW' either, but I recommend it for those who use 7-skin/layer method. \n\n* Overall: A solid 4/5 \n\n\nMuji's toner made me trust the whole sensitive line as the ingredients are few and look fine. Totally safe, right? So I bought that moisturizing milk as my skin is very dry and the toning water is not sufficient. \n\n\n**Muji Moisturizing Milk (High moisture)**\n\n* Ingredients: WATER,OLEA EUROPAEA (OLIVE) FRUIT OIL,DPG,GLYCERIN,PEG-32,ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE,PENTYLENE GLYCOL,GLYCOSYL TREHALOSE,GLYCERYL STEARATE,SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS (JOJOBA) SEED OIL ,HYDROLYZED STARCH,PEG-75 STEARATE, BEHENYL ALCHOL,POLY SORBATE-80,ALLANTOIN,POLYQUATERNIUM-51,PURSLANE EXTRACT,CITRUS GRANDIS(GRAPEFRUIT) FRUIT SEED EXTRACT,CARBOMER,ARGININE,BG,XANTHAN GUM,TOCOPHEROL,SODIUM ACID CITRATE ,PHENOXYETHANOL\n\n* Application: The scent's a bit stronger than the one of the toning water, some say it smells like glue and I agree. Still, it's mild and doesn't bother me. As for the texture, it's quite sticky and I felt like it just sat on top of my face. Depending on your skin type it may give you a glowy effect for the whole day or make you look like you bathed in oil— for me it was the second case. It should be used as a night moisturizer just before sleeping. If you rub the part where the milk is applied it becomes...chalky? Powdery? Kind of like when you rub a sunscreen with strong white cast. \n\n* Benefits: I was very disappointed. After using the moisturizing milk for three days my skin broke out and I spotted acne on my forehead and the skin around my nose was clogged. The break out wasn't very strong though, I think it's a good product for those with very very dry skin and without fungal acne issues. I looked up on Cosdna and saw that Ethylhexyl Palmitate is an ester which feeds the yeast on your face so... No good for fungal acne. \n\n* Price: Same as for the light toning water, it is a bit expensive in France and affordable in US. \n\n* Overall: It's not a bad product and I feel like it may be good for other people, however, the texture is sticky and feels greasy. For the price, I advise to try something else and avoid it completely if you have fungal acne or oily skin. 2/5 \n",

You can check out my comparative review for winter moisturisers [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/kjuvbt/comparative_review_cetaphil_dam_vs_reequil/).\n\nThe title mentions a lot of moisturisers I know, but all of them have been used in the past one year or so. Summers are icky and choosing a moisturiser has become harder for me. Should I even use one when my skin is wetter and saltier than the Indian Ocean at the moment? idk friends, you tell me. When it is extremely humid and I am stepping out, I do not use a moisturiser. I use a hydrating toner (klairs supple) and sunscreen (I have reviewed all of them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/o9jpj9/sunscreen_comparative_review_neutrogena_innisfree/) )\n\n* *Skin Type:* Combination, oily at the T zone. At the moment, extremely oil at the T Zone, esp during high humidity days.\n* *Current climatic conditions:* Continental, hot and humid at the moment\n* *AGE:* 27 yo female\n* *Usage timeline:* More than a month for all the moisturisers except the FormulaRx one.\n\n1. **Neutrogran Hydroboost Gel:** I do not honestly recall what I was using before I began using this. It is a silicone rich light gel and spreads easily. The texture is light and it does not feel heavy on the skin, though it does not get fully absorbed either. When I used it last year, it seemed okay but did not impress me much. The fragrance was high, which further put me off of it. **I bought it for 800 bucks but I just checked and it now retails for a whooping 1000 bucks for 50gm on Nykaa**. That is honestly too much for this blue jar. I have also seen influencers raving about it calling it \"ocean in a jar\"....Sorry, have they seen the state of the oceans? It is all kachra these days. While the gel is neither ocean nor kachra, **I did not repurchase it and will not do so**, simply because it is way below the mark for me. However it did not break me out.\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\n[Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Dimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Dimethicone/​Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone-vinyl-dimethicone-crosspolymer), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Polyacrylamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyacrylamide), [Cetearyl Olivate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-olivate), [Sorbitan Olivate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitan-olivate), [Dimethiconol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethiconol), [C13-14 Isoparaffin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c13-14-isoparaffin), [Dimethicone Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone-crosspolymer), [Chlorphenesin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/chlorphenesin), [Carbomer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/carbomer), [Laureth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-7), [Sodium Hyaluronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-hyaluronate), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [C12-14 Pareth -12](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-pareth-12), [Sodium Hydroxide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-hydroxide), [Blue 1](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-42090)\n\n**2. Simple Light Hydrating Moisturiser:** I got introduced to this moisturiser through this sub and I really like it! It is hydrating and occlusive as well. Its consistency is somewhere between a gel and a cream- but it is not as light as an emulsion, it is slightly leans towards the lotion side. I usually use it in months that are neither too hot, nor too cold. That is February, March and then September, October and November. In colder months, my skin remains dry despite using it and in hotter and humid months, this feels a little heavy for my combination skin. **I love it over all and it is definitely a no frills, value for money moisturiser, retailing for 430 bucks for 125ml on Nykaa. WRP.** Did not break me out.\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\n[Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Paraffinum Liquidum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/paraffinum-liquidum), [Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyglyceryl-3-methylglucose-distearate), [Dimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone), [Cetyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-palmitate), [Cetyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-alcohol), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Caprylyl Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylyl-glycol), [Carbomer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/carbomer), [Potassium Hydroxide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-hydroxide), [Tocopheryl Acetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tocopheryl-acetate), [Bisabolol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bisabolol), [Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-c10-30-alkyl-acrylate-crosspolymer), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Pantolactone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pantolactone), [Borago Officinalis Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/borago-officinalis-seed-oil), [Potassium Carbonate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-carbonate), [Pentylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentylene-glycol), [Urea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/urea), [Lactic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/lactic-acid), [Sodium Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lactate), [Serine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/serine), [Sorbitol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitol), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Allantoin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/allantoin)\n\n**3. Etude House Soon Jung Moist Relief All in One Gel-** This is the one I am using at the moment and it satisfies my currently very oily Tzone perfectly. It does feel a tad bit less for my cheeks but all the sweat makes for it lol ;\\_; . I tried the emulsion as well in the hopes of meeting all my needs but it feels sticky to me.It seems like I cannot have it all ;\\_;\n\nCompared to HydroBoost, this is way lighter! It is almost watery when applied on the skin.The ingredient list is impressive but I dont know if it has done anything extra special for my skin. It is good enough and that is perfectly satisfactory for me. I don't think it has any occlusives and it mainly just hydrates my skin. So i use it in my AM routine, and use the sunscreen over it. Hopefully that should trap all the moisture in, right? (insert Anakin and Padame meme). I love it and will buy it for summers, especially for the hot and humid months of May, June, July and August. I don't think it can satisfy my skin's needs in the other months. **It retails for 1200 bucks for 120 ml and is available only on Nykaa afaik. WRP.** Has not broken me out either.\n\n**Ingredients:** Water / Aqua / Eau, Propanediol, Panthenol, Silica, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Glyceryl Caprylate, Butylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Ethylhexylglycerin, Madecassoside, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Tocopherol\n\n**4. The FormulaRx Barrier Relief Lightweight Gel Cream:** This is a new kid on the block and the company does not have a good reputation here and rightfully so. I did not want to buy from them but then I sold my soul and compromised my morals all because its emulsion like texture seemed exactly what I wanted and felt it would suit my skin. Sorry heavenly father, I will do better. That said, the texture really is all that. It has ceramides and what not (=niacinamide). The texture is exactly how the long ass name describes it as- a cream-gel, g(j)elly cream etc etc. Also I have only used it only for a week, during my PM routine so these are strictly my first impressions. It sinks in nicely, given you are able to take out the desired amount from the metallic tube. Because often, you wont be- it will squirt out way more than what you need, the packaging is aesthetic but really inconvenient. Even the tube arrived all dented and pichka hua. Overall it is a good moisturiser that I will perhaps continue to use in my PM but I have not yet made my mind whether I'll repurchase it or not. **It retails for 799 bucks for 50gm and I feel it could have been priced lower.**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, caprylic/ capric triglyceride, glycerin, niacinamide, propanediol, cetearyl alcohol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, sodium hyaluronate, colloidal oatmeal, panthenol, allantoin, ceramide np, ceramide ap, ceramide eop, phytosphingosine, cholesterol, linoleic acid, sodium lauroyl lactylate, xanthan gum, butylene glycol, carbomer, tocopherol, phenoxyethanol, dimethicone, disodium edta, linolenic acid, ethylhexylglycerin.\n\nI hope these reviews are helpful! As always, these are my personal impressions and YMMV. So please take it with a pinch of salt. Additionally I have reviewed Disguise Cosmetic's C+C Sorbet [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/jyao20/disguise_cosmetics_cc_sorbet_review/).\n\nAnd yet,  [I still haven't found what I'm looking for](https://youtu.be/e3-5YC_oHjE). I actually did find something that suited me through most months- the Sulwhasoo Essential Balancing Emulsion. The texture and consistency are wonderful. Sinks in nicely. I don't feel dry or greasy. Moreover it brightens up my face. I absolutely love it. Unfortunately I only had a sample size which got over pretty soon ;\\_; I have been tempted to buy the full size but guys, does it make sense to spend 4k on the full size of this emulsion?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**edit(copying this from my comment below)**:  *Unfortunately today i woke with a painful zit. I do not get zits. So either it is because of the formularx moisturiser or the mangoes I am eating everyday. I guess karm ka phal ekdum mil gya.*\n\n It could be the ceramides because I have broken out a little because of them earlier too. Too soon to say it is this moisturiser. Will update here if I find anything conclusive.",

I don't necessarily believe in spending less or more based on the type of product. If it's something that absolutely fits all your bills and you know it won't make you want go buy anything else since it matches you to perfection it's better on getting that one than mindlessly trying to try multiple other products which anyways you wil be spending on. But if it's out of budge liek way off then keep your search on😅 for me it's cleansers. Ppl spend thr least on it but for me the perfect cleanser was something I badly needed. Found one expensive yes but saves me from buying or being tempted to buy anything else. Also I don't buy the other products in expensive range because I am happy with how the ones I already own function",

This serum has a thick viscous texture (almost like Hadalabo Gokujyun Premium) but a slightly slippery oily feel (no problem for acne, but just a note that it's better after watery serums) and my neck area in particular which is an issue for me already has improved to my satisfaction. I'd definitely be interested in trying their other serums now at this point. Very nice thick bottles that are opaque and protected from light. And at least if the performance of their peptide serum is any indication, I would cautiously speculate that their formulations may be effective too. But if you do end up testing their vit c and niacinamide serum out you should post an update for us with your results! I'm pretty curious about this brand too.",

Ordered on 23 May, received on 2 June.|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy Opinions:  \nI have combination skin and I do not use a moisturiser in the morning. I just wash my face and put on a sunscreen ([review](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/idcnxg/reequil_ultra_matte_sunscreen_review/)) and step out. When I am back home after work, I again cleanse and this is when I slather on a moisturiser. This is why I needed a thick moisturiser to ensure my skin gets its needed dose in one single application.  \nI tried out the DermaCo first. The delivery was slow and I did not like the fact that the tube had to go through crazy temperature differences during its long delivery time. I understand that the delay was probably due to the lockdown but when I wrote to DermaCo about this and suggesting that they sell through amazon as well, since their delivery network is better, all I got was scripted responses which were no where related to my concern. So not a fan of their customer service. As mentioned, this cream did absorb more easily than the Reequil. The huge problem is the Fragrance! I do not have sensitive skin and this is the first time that fragrance has affected me in a negative way. My eyes would get super irritated after putting this on. Trust me, I have tried everything to try and prevent this - never putting it close to my eyes, closing my eyes during application, covering my eyes with a sleeping mask during application etc. lol. Alas, nothing worked and the irritation continued. To be fair, the irritation level was different everyday - somedays it zinged a lot, on others it wasn't much. But it was always after putting this cream on! It could very well be any other ingredient that caused the irritation but I think it was the fragrance. I stopped using it after about a month.\n\nOrdered the Reequil as a replacement through amazon and delivery was in 2 days. With this cream the absorption is a bit of concern, it does take time to get into the skin. I figured that it works much better on moist skin. So I wash my face and just pat off the excess water before application. I have been using this since 1.5 months now.\n\nBoth these creams are moisturising enough. The reequil leaves a bit of oily layer on the skin - its not too much but definitely present. The DermaCo pretty much disappears after application.I have not had any break outs with either of them and no other irritation other than the eye thing with DermaCo.Both of them claim to be non-comedogenic as the whole formulation but both contain ingredients that can clog up the pores, as mentioned in the ingredients breakdown.\n\nFor now, I am happy with the Reequil based on my current requirements.",

I have hooded lids (full Korean).\n\n**Fragrance is not a deal-breaker for me in wash-off products, although I am wearier of essential oils than I am of synthetic fragrance. Will be bolding main fragrance ingredients.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kzfesai0y6251.jpg?width=425&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df6aa8bee3c981d106a4ee4e3d071a26002ea80a\n\n**Cost:** 8 oz - $24 (Ulta)\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Coco-Glucoside, Coconut Alcohol, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Glycerin, Carbomer, Isopropyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Citric Acid, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, **Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil,** Propylparaben, Triethanolamine, **Amyris Balsamifera (Amyris) Bark Oil, Bulnesia Sarmientoi Wood (Vera Wood) Oil, Cymbopogon Martini (Palmarosa) Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens (Sweet Scented Geranium) Flower Oil, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Oil, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Mimosa Tenuiflora Bark Extract, Ormenis Multicaulis (Wild Moroccon Chamomile) Oil, Piper Nigrum (Pepper) Fruit Oil, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Oil,** Fd&C Yellow No. 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n**Texture:** A pale yellow, milky, lightly foaming cleanser of medium thickness.\n\n**Efficacy:** Acceptable as a one-step travel cleanser. Pretty good at removing sunscreen and makeup if you take the time to massage it in. Felt like a godsend before being completely spoiled by AB first cleansers. That was when I thought a little bit of waterproof mascara being left over giving me slight raccoon eyes when I woke up in the morning was \"acceptable\" and \"as good as it's gonna get\".\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** No. Has gentle surfactants but **it also has TWELVE different essential oils.** One of which is endangered and need active conservation according to Wikipedia, which I personally don't feel comfortable using:\n\n>*Bulnesia sarmientoi* was listed as [endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species) in the 2018 publication of the [IUCN Red List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List), due to the [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation) of [Gran Chaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Chaco#Conservation_issues) and a strong global demand for its wood, extracts, and [essential oils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil) since 2001.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulnesia_sarmientoi#cite_note-IUCN-1) IUCN estimates indicate that over three generations the global population will decline by around 50%.\n\nRequires much more massaging to remove waterproof makeup which may be harsh on sensitive skin and cause more redness.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy. Not too strong.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No, it's a 2-in-1. However, it does not always get rid of everything on the first try, so another cleanse may be necessary.\n\n**Repurchase?** No. It did not bother my sensitive skin too much, but I'm cutting out all essential oils from my skincare + not effective enough as a first cleanser.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Naive Botanical Olive Cleansing Oil 230mL / 7.8 oz\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ovky561y6251.png?width=207&format=png&auto=webp&s=fecf9195af66872bce90dabfe904de2a500678a5\n\nI found out about this [here, ranked #4](https://my-best.net/15468). I wanted something with the highest cleansing power that washed off cleanly & is affordable.\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $14 on eBay before pandemic started. A little less than $7 in Japan. Even at double the price for me in the US, I have had this since **July 2019** (June 2020 now) and I am only *halfway through* it because of how incredibly effective it is with small amounts. I would run out of other cleansing oils relatively fast because of how much it takes to remove all my layers of waterproof makeup. Am shocked tbh.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, ethylhexyl palmitate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, glyceryl tri (caprylic acid / capric acid), PEG-8 glyceryl isostearate, sorbeth tetraisostearate-30, olive leaf extract, olive fruit oil, squalane, BG Water, cyclohexane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid bisethoxy diglycol, **perfume.**\n\n**Texture:** A cleansing oil of medium thickness, not overly greasy. Smooth, spreads very easily. Not super thin like something like Kose Softymo Speedy.\n\n**Efficacy:** Not drying at all on my very dry skin. SUPER effective at removing waterproof sunscreen and makeup. Takes absolutely NO TIME AT ALL, which is very different from other cleansing oils that required me to massage it in for a while. Color me beyond impressed. This is honestly the best first cleanser I've used so far. ZERO residue of any trace of makeup after removal.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes and no. It did not bother me personally but it does contain fragrance. I'm unsure if the current ingredient list is accurate as the Japanese ranking site states it contains essential oils but the list from Yesstyle does not.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy, woodsy. Not so strong that it is super bothersome.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Absolutely. As soon as it becomes affordable again when the pandemic dies down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Moistage W Cold Cream 270g / 9.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tcxvpzp1y6251.jpg?width=249&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0996cc355ecab1a721c0c6316ef76089e89c8b6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q416df74y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd8cd5a3d8cf58c3c0822eb9da142611c5826bc\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $16 on eBay. Currently about $19 on [Yesstyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/kracie-moistage-w-cold-cream-270g/info.html/pid.1069419619). Very cost-effective bc of its huge size.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, water, polysorbate 65, microcrystalline wax, glycerin, DPG, glyceryl stearate, dimethicone, stearoyl glutamate Na, stearic acid, polysorbate 80, beeswax, xanthan gum, olive oil, squalane, hydrogenated castor oil hydroxystearate, silk extract , Ethanol, hydrolyzed collagen, cetearyl alcohol, EDTA2Na, methyl paraben, ethyl paraben\\*\\*, perfume.\\*\\*\n\n**Texture:** A rich, thick white cream.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a huge NO from me, dawg. This is terrible. It barely removes anything waterproof and leaves a heavy residue. However, if you're the type of person who doesn't mind using a more stripping cleanser afterward to wash this off, or using a washcloth, I guess I can see it as being, um. Acceptable?\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** It is gentle but slightly fragranced. No reaction from my skin other than disgust at being left in a thick film after wash off.\n\n**Scent:** Very light floral.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** YES.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter 76g / 2.7 Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/znms9m83y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45f6d28d2958c8133b26a2ab363b88bcf71d065e\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $13.65 on Amazon. Currently [$14.85 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F165210/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea  (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, **Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene,** Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Citric Acid.\n\n**Texture:** A thick, opaque white balm, not overly greasy or waxy.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a good first cleanser. Quite travel friendly but I have not traveled with it in weather that would melt it so I don't know if it would leak through. It removes everything quite well, no complaints here. It still is not as good as the Kracie botanical olive one, takes longer to break down sunscreen and makeup, and may leave behind a slight amount of waterproof mascara if you aren't thorough enough with massaging/letting it sit on the skin long enough to melt everything.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Has not bothered mine, but fragrance is pretty strong. \n\n**Scent:** Strong floral. Although not strong enough to CHOKE on like some Korean products - those of intimate with Korean skincare - you know what I'm talking about. /sideyes my mom's side of the skincare in the bathroom\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** No, I don't like the scent and the packaging. It's hard to close properly on first try. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# (Not A First Cleanser But) [Equate Eye Makeup Remover](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Beauty-Oil-Free-Eye-Makeup-Remover-5-5-oz/39139097) 5.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfnqtmh5y6251.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05638b521fa8a76a4fe2673625e2b750241a492f\n\n**Cost:** $4 \n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Chloride, Dipropylene Glycol, Poloxamer 182, Allantion, Tetrasodium Edta, Benzalkonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cucumber (Cucumis Sativus), Fruit Extract, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium Phosphate. \n\n**Texture:** You gotta shake it before use. Watery but has silicone slip and thickness. \n\n**Efficacy:** I've used this as a first cleanser with a cotton pad in a pinch on extra lazy nights. It pretty works well to remove things pretty well although it WILL leave a residue obviously that you have to wash off. Honestly can't really tell the difference between this and the Neutrogena one and it's cheaper so. I use it to remove eyelash glue and waterproof mascara that I put on them. \n\nIt doesn't magically whisk away a mess of water-resistant lash glue residue + waterproof mascara on top of THAT (i don't really think anything can) but it's adequate, cheap, fragrance-free, oil-free and prolongs the wear on my beloved Miche Bloomin falsies (Girly Flair is the most popular bc of Pony Makeup but that style is horrible for me - it's SUPER fragile and breaks so easily compared to the other styles) by 10x. \n\nI just pour some in my palm and poke the lashes in a little puddle of it for a bit till the mascara comes off and then remove the glue with my fingers afterward. I don't wash them off afterward and whatever residue it leaves behind does not interfere at all with the next coat of mascara I put on them lashes.\n\n(Gonna write a separate review, but FYI - I prefer [DUO quick drying lash glue](https://www.ulta.com/duo-quick-set-lash-adhesive-clear?productId=pimprod2003529) in the purple label more than the super famous Japanese [D-Up Eyelash Fix](https://www.amazon.co.jp/D-UP-%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A2%E3%83%83%E3%83%97-4946324013622-D-U-P-%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC/dp/B0012VQTO2/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=d-up&qid=1590969259&sr=8-5) that's touted as #1 globally. I find that it's SOOO much quicker drying than D-Up and makes the lashes stick BETTER, longer, and stands stronger to tears. Plus it's latex-free too, for sensitive eyes. And way cheaper! I regret getting extra back ups of the D-Up thinking it'll be the best thing ever. There are still some cons that D-Up has an upperhand on, but I'll talk about that in that review post.)\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell yeah. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMini-Review on the **Garnier Skin Active Micellar Cleansing Water (Pink Cap):** This was just a sample so I ran out of it pretty fast but I remember being surprised that it actually was pretty effective at removing waterproof makeup. Scent-free, I quite liked it I think. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water, For Waterproof Makeup (Blue Cap), 13.5 Fl Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4fb7kb6y6251.jpg?width=556&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b56036478b358bd5043af8f80652b63a71cb7f9f\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $6.59 on Amazon. \n\n**Ingredients:** AQUA/WATER, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, ISOHEXADECANE, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DECYL GLUCOSIDE, POLYAMINOPROPYL BIGUANIDE. F.I.L.# D178190/1 \n\n**Texture:** Watery, greasy. I hate this. I got it mainly to remove waterproof sunscreen from my neck and chest at the end of the day without taking a whole damn shower. Leave a very unpleasant, greasy residue that I cannot stand on my skin. No. \n\n**Efficacy:** I only tried removing my makeup with this several times and it was okay I think. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Definitely. \n\n**Repurchase?** No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Sensibio H2O 500 ml / 16.7 fl oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3q1ucyc8y6251.jpg?width=443&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffe3ed17780adf84d930a94d27ae29416decdc52\n\n**Cost:** $15 on Amazon.com\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (aqua), Peg-6 Caprylic/capric Glycerides, Cucumis Sativus (cucumber) Fruit Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Propylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Cetrimonium Bromide. \n\n**Texture:** Watery, very light! Refreshing. Doesn't leave a greasy gross residue like above. I still splash water on top of the skin before toweling off and I still can feel a slight film. Ideally, I would like to wash it all off bc Lab Muffin says it's still not the best to leave surfactants on the skin, but most nights I can't be bothered and it shouldn't be *that* bad if people in places with harsh water just leave it on the skin, right? \n\nI guess a way to deal with that would be to wipe away using a toner/water/spray with a cotton pad or something but idk, that's more unnecessary garbage I feel. And more rubbing sensitive skin. \n\n**Efficacy:** This is fairly new. Got it for the same reason as the Garnier blue cap. It removes my waterproof sunscreen from my neck just fine with a baby wipe or cotton pad. But for everyday, I much prefer a cleansing oil to reduce the amount of tugging and rubbing on my skin as well as disposable wipes or pads. I tried it for removing waterproof mascara from my falsies like the Equate one, but it was okay, similar, but not as good and not as \"conditioning\" on my falsies to keep them soft. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** For me, yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** Yes! \n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext on my Wish List!!:\n\n\\- Muji Sensitive Cleansing Oil 400 ml\n\n\\- Muji Mild Cleansing Oil 400 ml \n\n\\- Muji Mild Milky Cleansing 200 ml \n\n\\- More cleansing gels (first cleansers NOT second cleansers) (I've tried Kikumasamune one before and I really liked that one for heavy, non-waterproof makeup days! Also Innisfree Jeju Bija cleansing gel - but this dried my skin out a bit when used as a LONE first cleanser but for some odd reason was fine when followed up with an actual second cleanser! So strange. That was years ago tho. Much earlier than Kiku.)\n\n\\- DHC Deep Cleansing Oil\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------\n\nHope that helps! \n\n(Ugh I have so many review posts and other posts I wanna write and I can't get them off my mind but I gotta wait for the big sunscreen & ceramide/pseudo-ceramide/urea creams review posts bc I'm so damn extra and gotta wait til I can take more Before & After photos months apart and compare winter vs summer performances. /eyeroll \n\nBUT I WANNA TALK ABOUT MORE SKINCARE RIGHT NOOOWWW SDKFJSD32kfd#@! But don't want to make claims or claim favs without *absolute* thorough testing either.. Sigh, the struggle!!!)",

Does it wash off clean when you emulsify it or is a second cleanse necessary?",

AB is my fav skincare sub and I love talking with everyone in it and contributing but the mods are making it really hard for me to want to participate anymore.\n\nI’ve been part of AB ever since it was a very small sub under various accounts/anon and it’s hard for me to have my “home” be taken away like this.",
