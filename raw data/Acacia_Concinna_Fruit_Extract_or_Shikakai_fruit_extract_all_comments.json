At least that's how I understood the article.\n\nAlso, I think there were indeed recipes that called for several ingredients but I do know that some of these can be used on their own. Arappu is said to be good for ageing ladies who worry about their hair turning grey. I'm used to shikakai (powdered, mixed with water) as it's convenient to travel with. It doesn't small as pleasant, but it definitely seems to keep my hair cleaner than commercial shampoos do.\n\nSimilarly, there are multiple powders derived from plants or earth (like multani) that have been used for cleansing one's skin.",

        "body": "This luscious mane belongs to none other than Whitney White, known as Naptural85. At over one million subscribers, Naptural85 is the largest type 4 natural hair Youtuber on the site. \n\nWhitney started her natural hair journey, roughly 9 years ago. Her hair was 4a/4b at the time, but since has loosened out to a simple 4a. Whit, as her fans affectionately call her, has fine-stranded, medium porosity hair. Many of those who view her cite her incredible density as what drew them to her videos.\n\nStarting with what is known as a TWA, or \"teeny weeny afro\", Whitney has since grown her hair to waist to tailbone length. Whitney prefers to make her own products, showing particular affinity to clay washes, homemade oil mixes, black soap and aloe vera. However, she has no aversion to store-bought synthetic products, and doesn't seem to credit her hair growth exclusively to her own products. Whitney has recently released her own haircare line, [Melanin Haircare](https://melaninhaircare.com/collections/all-products). While the line currently only has a twisting cream and an oil blend, both Whitney's original recipes, she is planning to release other products like cleansers, conditioners and stylers.\n\nIn this video she tries a concoction of shikakai, amla, and sweet potato as a cleansing cowash. Shikakai and amla are both known for being part of Ayurveda. Shikakai, due to its low PH, is often used for shine, and is an effective gentle cleanser, while amla is often used to counteract the curl loosening of henna treatments and to give a browner tint to henna dyed hair.",

Different clays work differently, so you might experiment with different ones to see if your hair might be happier. It's my understanding that clay deposits minerals on your hair, not removes them. People use this to add strength and flexibility. The general guideline is that alkaline washes shouldn't be used more often than every 4 days. \n\nShikakai can be drying by itself. That's why it's traditionally mixed with amla. It's also often mixed with reetha/aritha/soapnut to help broaden the saponins effect. Again, it's very cleansing all by itself.\n\nI'd encourage you to perhaps try these ingredients by themselves before mixing them, so you know how they behave and how your hair reacts to them.",

I was thinking of just doing either the bentonite clay or the shikakai but i need would prefer the cleansing effects of both. With that i was worried it might be a little drying and while i would prefer to use aloe, i dont have any atm, i have some on the way but it will be a few more days.

I let the herbs steep for 15 minutes after which I filter them through a fine cloth tea bag and transfer to an applicator bottle. While it did a wonderful job of cleaning my scalp & roots it left my hair dry and dull. The ACV rinses were making it worse. I omitted the ACV altogether and just used the tea, but before washing my hair I applied a very small amount of jojoba oil throughout my strands. These saponifying herbs washed out just enough oil so that my hair didn't feel greasy or weighed down and looks shiny and healthy when fully dry. I can go a full five days between washes with this routine, which is a record for me. \n\nTl;Dr the jojoba oil is creating a slight protective layer on my strands to shield them from the drying effects of a tea rinse",

However if a person has flaxen / golden/blonde hair they have genes that produce eumelanin hindered or switched off - I think no herb can override that : e.g. They can't turn dark brown from flaxen blonde because of Reetha or Shikakai.\n\nThe herbs can deposit greenish brownish residue if hair is porous ,bleached or over styled and appear murky dirtier shade on blondes  \n\nI use all Ayurvedic herbs and my golden red streaks for example just became richer they never turned darker.\n\nIf they still worry about colour why not use Moroccan clay and just add a  teaspoon of both  Shikakai and Reetha for extra clean & conditioner and a bit of chamomile perhaps?",

I absolutely loved shikakai, it drastically reduced hairloss or scalp sensitivities and I'd recommend it to anyone willing to lose their blonde color. \n\nPS: I've chatted a whole bunch about this to different people, and heard a lot from those who use soapwort for laundry have also had their whites transform in browns after a couple washes... \n\nVery interesting answer, but i just wanted to chime in. My hair got really dark really fast, and 4 months later it hasn't got back to its natural light (getting there though, and also not using aggressive shampoo)",

If there's anyone in Bombay who knows of any local supplier or market in townside/southern part of the city please do let me know.\n\n Am also looking to buy Arappu powder, will try the nearby Arya Vaidya Shala, else have found a supplier online selling it for about 200 Rs/Kg, which seems not too bad, although I have seen it being sold for much much cheaper at cities down south for retail, so any intel on that would also be great.\n\nAlthough the powders are pretty easily available online, I did find a huge difference in the efficacy of the concoction when I used Amazon bought stuff compared to the powders that I had bought a long time ago from my Granny's local market in Rajasthan. since Ive run out of both, I'm looking to replenish it asap before the monsoons properly kick in.\n\nTIA guys!",

It started with some reddish hues and in a couple washes turned to dark brown (and the strands which used to be my most blonde/lightest strands have a red/ginger hue)...\n\nI used to use cassia obavata (\"blonde henna\") powder about 15 yrs ago, and decided to start again and my hair became quite reddish. I never had that effect in the past, if anything it turned them golden... but i mix it with a different apple cider vinegar than i used to, and use distilled water (i used to use tap water). Also i often store it in the fridge, if that plays any effect? It can't be cassia, right? I'm so confused.\n\nAt the same time, I started Shikakai. I wonder if it's the culprit? Ever heard anything about it changing hair color? I mix it in water, shampoo and rinse within a single minute, i definitely don't leave it on...\n\nAnd lately i've used Alma. I don't think it's the problem because i started later. Any blonde out there using alma powder regularly? Like shikakai, i leave it only a minute.\n\nAny input of light-haired head would be so appreciated!! It's hard to test because it takes ages to fade and tbh i loved shikakai i don't want to stop using it...\n\nThank yooooouu :)",

I don't understand, i would love just to use this product :(",

It may take a few weeks, so stick with it if you can.  A henna that I like is the \"Jamila\" brand, or \"Zenia\" (might be a little cheaper for your initial \"try-it-out\" stage). You can find these on Amazon. And since your hair is black, the \"color\" you choose won't make much difference.  BUT learn from my mistake, and NEVER buy black henna!!  It's not found in nature.  It has an added chemical called PPO in it that can burn your skin.  If you ever want to darken the tint of henna, add indigo powder to the shikakai/henna mixture.  The result will be less red, and more brown - depending on the proportions added.  This is useful for when you start to get grey hairs!",

But if your product contains silicones, heavy waxes and petroleum based ingredients, I think it's doubtful that shikakai would work on them.\n\nYou may want to look into low poo product that can be mostly rinsed away with just water. r/curlyhair has an extensive list of good low poo and co-wash products and a bot you can paste ingredient lists into to see if a different one qualifies. \n\nIf you wish to have a more natural hair routine, you may want to give up the hairstyle that requires it to be glued in place and find something that more suits both you and your hair. \n\nI have 3b superfine ringlets and find that my own sebum is the only product I need to give them sealing, structure, definition and some support. No, my hair isn't glued in place for a week, but I can easily go 3-4 days between resets, which can be as simple as just getting my hair wet and setting my curls again. I can't do some things that those with product heavy routines can do, but I can also do things that are a hard stop no for them, so it's a trade off and one that I'm happy with.",

The beautiful and sometimes frustrating thing with no poo is that it‚Äôs fairly simple if you want it to be, but some things that work for some people don‚Äôt work for others.\n\nShikakai is typically a universally workable wash method.  Shikakai and amla on their own usually cover all washing and conditioning needs for most hair.  If you have specific problems you‚Äôre dealing with, you may need to employ specific steps like deep conditioning, or cold water.  Otherwise, it‚Äôs simply 1-2Tbsp shikakai, 1tsp amla, either steeped as a tea until cool then use the liquid without the powder that settles at the bottom, or used as a paste.  Apply, scrub, rinse, don‚Äôt use hot water.

    "body": "A while ago there was this post about Shikakai: https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/5osssf/ill_leave_if_im_not_welcome_but_just_wanted_to/?st=iyakxqbw&sh=b0233377\n\nMy mom discovered it by accident the same day as me from her friend and bought it immediately, so I got the chance to try it and here's my first impression for anyone who's interested. Please, take in consideration I probably messed it up a little :D\n\nFirstly, it smell really strange. Not bad - actually at first smell I really like it, the second not that much but it's definitely something I have to get used to. The Khadi Shikakai (that's the name of brand/product I was using) is powder and you have to make a paste of it. Depends of how long your hair is, one should use one to two spoons and mixed it with hot/boiling water. I used hot because I'm dumb and boiling should be probably used, there are different information on the container itself and the website of the product. I also used too much water so it was more \"liquidy\".\n\nIt should be applied everywhere, not just the scalp. It doesn't make foam and if you ever used rye flour as a shampoo it feels really similar. The paste (or liquid in my case) should sit on the hair for 10 to 15 minutes. \n\nWhat surprised me was after washing it out, my hair felt a bit like after conditioning. It felt much smoother then after regular shampoo or rye flour. But I used conditioner nevertheless. For me personally the bits of the herbs were hard to wash out, even harder then the flour I used before.\n\nI surly will use it more in the future and since my hair are still wet I cannot say if it made any noticeable difference. But after seeing hair of my mom, they certainly seemed more shinier and hydrated(?). It's quite hard to describe but that's how it seemed to me.\n\nIf you have any questions I'll try to answer them. Also sorry for any mistakes, English isn't my native language.",

I dump some into a plastic cup, get in the shower, and mix it by hand. Sometimes if I have the time, I'll use a little funnel to prep a few little plastic travel bottles I bought, so I can take them into the shower to fill & use as an individual wash.\n\nI've been doing this for several months, and my hair seems to love it. My scalp is a bit flaky, but I think that's seasonal more than it is cleanser related.\n\nMy issue is that I feel like I'm spending a lot of time & money doing this every time I wash my hair (approx. 3x per week). Am I using too much? If I use any less, my hair feels greasy. Is there a more money saving and/or time saving way I can continue using shikakai, without involving 5 more ingredients into the prep work? The few sources I've seen that mention shikakai are either Indians who use it on a rare occasion as a treatment rather than a standard shampoo, or other people who create elaborate concoctions with EOs and other ingredients.\n\nI just want a simple, quick, and fairly inexpensive way to use shikakai to clean my hair.

Stir it till it's well mixed. Let it cool to at least body temperature (aka safe to touch). Then apply to your hair while still a little bit warm. Let it sit for (at least) 10-15 min. Then rinse.\n\nThe amount of water I'm not sure about. It should become yoghurt-like so I think you need very little water.\n\nI believe it's two tablespoons if your hair is about shoulder-armpit length. And you may need more if your hair is longer unless you mostly apply it on your scalp you won't need as much. So if you only clean your scalp, maybe just one table spoon is enough.\n\nThis is all based on what I've read. Now I think of it, I wanted to try Amla myself. Might as well order it.",

Sometimes it works great, sometimes it doesn't though I do the exact same thing.\n\nA weird thing that happened the last time I tried it was before I went out for the evening. When my hair dried it looked greasy and flat. I thought \"crap\" but didn't have time to wash again so I tied my hair up and went out. The morning afterwards I woke up and it looked amazing. Like it just been washed. Which is weird.\n\nSo I'd like some expert help, for example, is it better as a thick paste? More liquidy? I've heard it's  to slowly add water while massaging to activate the saponins, is this true? \n\nThanks in advance! \n\nPS I've done the \"transition period\" of getting my hair used to non chemical alternatives to shampoo. I've been doing it for quite some time now. Started with baking soda, learnt that was not great for hair so moved to chickpea flour, then sidr powder, now shikakai.",

I follow my grandma‚Äôs routine to a tee so here it is: prepare the reetha amla and Shikakai (I get the mixed powders from my local Indian grocery store), I swish it around in a little water. I then LIGHTLY oil the ends of my hair. And then I massage the preparation into my hair. I massage for a good 3-5 minutes depending on how lazy I am.\n\nMy grandma usually adds hibiscus powder for conditioning but I use regular conditioner. After I rinse the ‚Äúshampoo‚Äù off, I lightly pat dry my hair with a micro fibre towel and either add a drop of oil to my ends OR leave in conditioner.\n\nMy grandma doesn‚Äôt add anything, she just washes and that‚Äôs it. I used to have hair fall initially where I started this natural routine too, but just for a week at most. It‚Äôs all normalised now and my hair is very healthy. It‚Äôs important to just keep going and make sure you don‚Äôt have any other product buildup or dust/dirt or sebum building up on your scalp.",

Shikakai is a wholesome component as its leaves and young nodes are often consumed. The shikakai fruit pods are parched in direct sunlight and made into a fine powder for usage. The much older generations used henna and shikakai for beauty purposes, especially for hair. This traditional and natural hair remedy has gained immense momentum and many brands are incorporating this natural ingredient into their products. In this blog, we will be exploring a few of the ultimate benefits of [shikakai powder for hair](https://www.kirpalexport.com/products/shikakai-powder/).\n\n**Benefits of shikakai powder for hair**\n\nThe following are some of the ultimate natural benefits of shikakai powder for hair\n\n¬∑ Fights of dandruff\n\nThe anti-fungal properties of shikakai nourish your scalp and stop the constant itching and dryness of the scalp.\n\n¬∑ Heals minor scalp wounds\n\nThe natural power of shikakai has calming benefits which soothe an irritated scalp either from the weather or unhealthy practices. It helps to heal small cuts or wounds.\n\n¬∑ A good detangling helper\n\nMostly frizzy wavy or curly hair has detangling problems. It is very rare for straight hair people to have tangles unless they have split ends or haven't combed in a couple of days.\n\n¬∑ An affordable product that lasts longer \n\nShikakai is a lot less expensive and a natural alternative product that yields the perfect benefits for hair\n\n¬∑ Completely beneficial for your hair \n\nThe natural properties of shikakai make your hair softer by providing nourishment which imparts stunning shine to the hair strands.\n\n¬∑ Natural shampoo\n\nThe natural shikakai powder in itself doesn‚Äôt lather up much as stated in the blog before.",
