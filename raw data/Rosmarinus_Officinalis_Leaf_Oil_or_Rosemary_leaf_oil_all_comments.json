    "body": "I have been a long time devoted user of the Round Lab Mugwort Calming Cleanser, and would consider it my HG. I can't even remember how many tubes of it I've gone through. Recently I've noticed that it's started going up in price (last time I bought it I had to pay $26 CAD), and it's become increasingly hard to justify that price for a cleanser. So when I saw this Bring Green Artemisia pH Balancing Foam at my local kbeauty shop for $13.99 CAD I had to try it!\n\n\nSkin type: combination, dehydrated, acne and clog prone\n\n\nRound Lab Ingredients:\n\nWater, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Butylene Glycol, Coco-Betaine, Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Artemisia Vulgaris Extract, Aspartic Acid, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl Glycol, Polyquaternium-67, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Malt Extract, 1,2- Hexanediol, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Allantoin, Madecassoside, Panthenol, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid\n\n\nBring Green Ingredients:\n\nGlycerin, Purified Water, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Lauryl Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Artemisia Capillaris Extract (8,000ppm), Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Malt Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Lavender Oil, Citrus Nobilis (Mandarin Orange) Peel Oil, Rosemary Leaf Oil, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Orange Peel Oil, Polyquaternium-39, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder (800ppm), Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Ethylhexylglycerin, Linalool, Limonene \n\n\nBoth cleansers claim to be pH balanced at 5.5 and gentle on the skin. That I will say is true, I never had irritation using the Round Lab, and in the 4 times I've used the Bring Green I didn't either. They both leave my skin feeing properly cleansed without being stripped or dry. \n\n\nTexture wise I prefer the Round Lab. It has a slightly thicker texture which foams up to a nice rich foam. However at times it can take a little extra effort to rinse away. The Bring Green does foam up just as well, but it isn't as rich of a foam. It contains very tiny visible bits of mugwort, but they're so small you don't feel them. It also rinses away much cleaner and faster. \n\n\nIn terms of scent the Round Lab doesn't really have one, it smells very faintly of mugwort. The Bring Green however has a light citrus scent due to the essential oils, but it isn't overpowering and doesn't linger once rinsed. \n\n\nOverall I think I might end up switching to the Bring Green. Although the user experience might not be as pleasant as when using the Round Lab, for almost half the price it's definitely worth keeping in my routine.",

    "body": "Long time lerker and first-time poster. \nGender & Age: 31F\nClimate: UK \nSkin Type: dry, dehydrated, sensitive, eczema, reactive.\nSkin concerns: fine lines & wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, large pores, closed comedones (sometimes).\n\nAmuse-¬†PhytoncicaTM LHA Reboot Toner: This was my first LHA toner and I enjoyed using it. My skin doesn't respond well to most BHA & AHA toners so I mainly stick to PHA's, but I wanted to try LHA. This was probably gentle enough to use every night, but I think exfoliating that much is overkill personally. I used it every other night, it had a light watery consistency, and it didn't sting or burn my skin. My skin would look decongested, clearer and smoother the next day. \nVerdict: Get on my face now.\n\nCOSRX Advanced Snail Radiance Dual Essence: I enjoyed this product but not as an essence. I would use a more hydrating essence and then use this in my serum stage. It has a goopy consistency but does sink into the skin nicely and adds hydration and a little moisture, but I didn't notice any other benefits. On its own, it wasn't enough hydration for me.\nVerdict: S'nice \n\nMary & May 6 Peptide Complex Serum: I'll be honest, I never really know whether peptides are doing anything, but I continue to use them in the hope I'll still look 30 when I'm in my 60's (jk). This has a light water-like consistency that absorbs easily into the skin. It didn't irritate my skin, but I didn't see any noticeable improvements.\nVerdict: Meh\n\nPyunkang Yul - Calming Moisture Barrier Cream: This is a really nice creamy facial moisturiser that left my skin feeling comfortable and well-maintained. As the weather got colder, I noticed this wasn't really cutting it, but in the autumn, it was just the right amount of thickness and moisture. \nVerdict: S'nice \n\nDr.Ceuracle - Cica Regen Vegan Sun SPF50+ PA++++: The competition for sunscreens is very high. I already have so many favourites that perform so well. This is a decent sunscreen and it does the job. It's not too greasy, a little bit moisturising, does not feel heavy on the skin, and doesn't leave a white caste (which as a dark-skin Black woman I very much appreciate). The only thing I did not like was the Rosemary leaf oil - but that was my fault for not reading the ingredients. ( Yes,  I accidentally set the corner of it on fire with a candle) \nVerdict: Meh\n\nPsa VISIBLE IMPROVEMENT Peptides & Niacinamide Serum: Unfortunately, this broke me out and I was not able to continue using it. This has saccharomyces as one of the ingredients, which I've since realised my skin reacts very badly to.\nVerdict: It's a no for me \n\nJordan Samuel - The Matinee Cream Cleanser: A very gentle, non-drying, non-stripping cream cleanser. This left my skin feeling so good. It's a true cream cleanser, as in it doesn't change consistency when water is added. I feel dry-skinned folk would really enjoy this one. It is pretty pricey for a cleanser but I think that it is reflective of the quality and the brand's size. It doesn't however beat my HG - Isnstree yam root vegan milk cleaner.\nVerdict: Get on my face now\n\nCOSRX Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream: This is another one I was not able to finish. I think this was my first gel cream. I have since learnt gel creams do not work for my skin, they are far too lightweight for my dry skin. I tried to use this in many different ways, as well as in the summer but it just never worked and my skin would be dry within a few hours. After being open for way longer than the recommended time it developed a smell and I didn't feel safe putting it on my face.\nVerdict: It's a no for me",

While they are not the exact products of Beauty of Joseon, some of the ingredients are similar but of course not exactly the same.  Some of the products are particularly popular in Korea at the moment because Hanbang and plant based?\n\n[KIcho Sheep Oil](http://beautyfaceskin123.blogspot.com/2016/07/review-on-kicho-sheep-oil-cream.html)\n-this product is free from T.E.A, artificial scents, mineral oil, isopropyl alcohol, paraben, urea, heavy metals and formaldehyde.   Since it is anti aging product and is for dry skin, it contains a lot of plants extract(8 types of berries), essential oil, beeswax, silicone, shea butter hyaluronic acid and oils(grapefruit,lemon, orange) Dimethicone is the second ingredients after water.   So, it can be clogging if you do not like those ingredients.  The moisture lasted whole day.  There are ceramide, lanolin, collagen and sea water. No butylene glycol. (press sample, no affiliate link)\n \n[Hansaeng Cosmetics RIN Bi-gyeol Soo Essence](http://beautyfaceskin123.blogspot.com/2016/07/review-on-hansaeng-cosmetics-rin-bi.html)\nThis is a hanbang skincare from Korea. Niacinamide is high on the list along with a lot of hanbang which include the famous ginseng ingredients(6 fermented years). It has floral scent to it. Texture is light and absorb well.  It has Triethanol amine  which some said it is dangerous but it is not a problem for me.  No paraben.( press sample ,no affiliate link)\n\n[Hansaeng Cosmetics RIN Bi-gyeol Soo Cream](http://beautyfaceskin123.blogspot.com/2016/07/review-on-hansaeng-cosmetics-rin-bi_28.html)\nIt has the same hanbang ingredients(fermented 6 years ginseng) in the cream with the same smell but with different kind of texture. It is pretty light and calming. The jar is of course luxurious and looks like a blue pearl. Niacinamide is lower than the essence but it is still high. No paraben but contains Triethanol amine  to adjust the ph.

Cloudy and milky when mixed well from shaking.\n\nTexture: watery oily essence, requires cotton pad for wiping off sunscreen/makeup\n\nCleansing power: did not live up to claims, refer to photos for tests on foundation, eye makeup and lip colours in comments\n\nMoisturizing: yes, skin does feel moisturized after even without additional skincare (but im oily in tropical climate so cannot attest for dry skin and climate)\n\nPore care: does not clean as well as advertised and very minimal tightening observed\n\nConclusion: WNRP, it‚Äôs a fun treat for those who wants to try something new but there are definitely better alternatives to cleansing water at the same or even lower price points.",

However, it's when I got into the many extracts...plant extracts. They use the scientific name so it was really hard to find some translations for those. I left them as they are so if someone else has the translations for those that would be so helpful. I know some might not be right so please take this with a grain of salt. I used a lot of sources to try and translate this. Naver was the most helpful because sometimes a picture would show up with that ingredient and the English name would be in there as well. Also some ingredients were thankfully translated from other products and they showed up. I typed them all in from the insert I received with the product so if you want the full picture just let me know and I'll attach the ingredients picture.\n\nPurified water, glycerin, Dipropylene glycol, Triethylhexanoin, butylene glycol, sweet almond seed extract, 1,2-hexanediol, Dimethicone, Maitake mushroom fruiting body extract, Maltodextrin, Lactobacillus/Ampelocissus Martini Fruit/Lavender Flower/Rosa Canina Fruit/Rosemary Leaf/Sage leaf/Thyme Leaf Extract Ferment Filtrate, Acetobacter/Aspergillus/Lactobacillus/Leuconostoc/pediococcus/Saccharomyces/Zygosaccharomyces/tangerine/Citrus Madurensis Fruit Extract/citron/apple/banana/papaya/pear/persimmon/watermelon/peach/plum/fig/quince/loquat fruit/apricot/date/pumpkin/chestnut/wild grape/ raspberry/ Momordica Grosvenori /goji/soybean/red soybean/Canavalia Gladiata/rice/barley/Adlay/ÎèåÌîºÏî®/Ï°∞/millet/daylily flower/cabbage leaves/stem/ Morus bombycis/perilla frutescens/sweet potato/taro/Chinese yam rhizome/Ïù¥Î¶¨Îç∞ÏïÑ ÎùºÎØ∏ÎÇòÎ¶¨Ïò§Ïù¥Îç∞Ïä§/ Kelp (Laminaria Japonica )/ ÎÑ§ÎßàÏãúÏä§Ìã∞Ïä§ Îç∞ÏãúÌîºÏóîÏä§/ brown seaweed/ Radish / turnip / carrot / burdock root / lotus / onion / Lilium auratum stem scales/licorice/grassroots/sesame/ginkgo nut/bear fruit/carrot seeds/ginseng/fruit of the silvervine/ Hericium erinaceum/plum/ Akebia Quinata Fruit/Japanese Hawthorn Fruit/Cornus/Longan Fruit/ Houttuynia cordata/mugwort/bamboo leaf/ground ivy/chamomile flowers/Horsetail/Cassia seed/Dandelion/Isodon japonicas/ÌôìÌôî/ Plantago asiatica/yacon/garlic/ginger/beet/Vietnamese coriander/turmeric/Oga tree roots/pine nuts/shiitake mushroom/auricularia mushroom/vitis rabe ruseuka fermentation helianthus tuberosus/potato fermentation extract, beta-glucan, panthenol, betaine, Í∏ÄÎùºÏù¥ÏΩîÏã§Ìä∏Î†àÌï†Î°úÏä§ (trehalose lycopene), lime oil, rosemary leaf oil, grape leaf oil, hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, squalane, ÎîîÌéúÌÉÄÏóêÎ¶¨Ïä§Î¶¨Ìã∏Ìó•ÏÇ¨C5-9Ïï†Ïî®ÎìúÏóêÏä§ÌÑ∞,  propylene glycol, hydroxypropyl ethyl acrylate/sodium acrylic co-polymer, glycerol acrylate, acrylic acid copolymer, carbomer, acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate cross polymer, tromethamine, trisodium EDTA, mica, titanium dioxide, red iron oxide, polysorbate 60, limonene\n\n\nEDIT: Here are the missing ones.

Vitamin E is solid but in loads of products, the retinyl esters (including palmitate) have limited research backing them so I always want to see a percentage. Not sure why bisabolol is listed under the oil base, it's one of the key actives in German chamomile. Bisabolol and calendula have antimicrobial activity.",

This is the first time I've ever experienced an infestation and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just wanted to share that during this ordeal I was bitten literally everywhere (yes, all the places you don't want to think about) EXCEPT my face. I can only attribute this to the overpriced face oil I was using: Kiehl's Midnight Recovery Concentrate. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was actually annoyed when I received this as a Christmas gift, since I felt like it was a strong hint from my sister in law that my skincare game was subpar, but now I am a devotee. Can't speak to the anti-aging properties since I feel like this bed bug ordeal has aged me 10 years, but it is a great smelling way to keep nasty critters off your face. Looking at the ingredients, it has a lot of crossover from natural bug sprays: \n\nCAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE  \nDICAPRYLYL CARBONATE  \nSQUALANE  \nROSA CANINA FRUIT OIL  \nOENOTHERA BIENNIS OIL / EVENING PRIMROSE OIL  \nSIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS OIL / JOJOBA SEED OIL  \nCORIANDRUM SATIVUM OIL / CORIANDER SEED OIL  \nTOCOPHEROL  \nLAVANDULA ANGUSTIFOLIA OIL / LAVENDER OIL  \nPELARGONIUM GRAVEOLENS FLOWER OIL  \nLINALOOL  \nROSMARINUS OFFICINALIS LEAF OIL / ROSEMARY LEAF OIL  \nCITRONELLOL  \nGERANIOL  \nLAVANDULA HYBRIDA OIL  \nCUCUMIS SATIVUS EXTRACT / CUCUMBER FRUIT EXTRACT  \nCURCUMA LONGA EXTRACT / TURMERIC ROOT EXTRACT  \nLIMONENE  \nCITRAL  \nSCLAREOLIDE  \nROSA SPP / ROSE FLOWER OIL  \nJASMINUM OFFICINALE EXTRACT / JASMINE EXTRACT  \nHELIANTHUS ANNUUS SEED OIL / SUNFLOWER SEED OIL\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, just sharing my endorsement for this stuff if you're trying to save your face and neck from bedbugs.

Anways, I am almost 21 and I've been pulling my eyebrows for few years already and I've even started pulling out my eyelashes. My father doesn't have eyebrows and eyelashes anymore and I can always see him trying to pick at non-existent hairs which then heavily triggers my trichotillomania on top of me being already stressed and anxious. Unfortunately, he gets angry at me when I tell him to stop doing that so now I'm trying for who knows what time stop pulling all by myself but few months of no pulling is the maximum for me. I'm so tired of spending hours in the bathroom looking at mirror and getting insane urge to pull everything that \"doesn't seem right\" even though I'm fully aware that I should stop doing that and that weird satisfaction at the end is definitely not worth it. My eyebrows and eyelashes were naturally on the darker, thicker, coarser side and people even used to compliment them, but now all I'm getting is people asking why I'm not filling them up or shaming me like my mother, but even all that shame is not enough for me to completely stop (instead I just end up feeling even more miserable). Is it too late for me to regain back what I've lost because right now they are thin, patchy, light and almost looking non-existent? I'm starting to let them grow once again (hopefully I don't relapse this time) and I've even installed some kind of habit tracking app. I also have some kind of lotion for stopping hair from falling out and making it grow even more with these ingredients: \nAQUA, GLYCERIN, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, TRIGONELLA FOENUM-GRAECUM SEED EXTRACT, ROSMARINUS OFFICINALIS LEAF OIL, PANTHENOL, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SODIUM BENZOATE, SODIUM LEVULINATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, LIMONENE, LINALOOL. Will those help me? Should I get another serum or castor oil? Are my hair roots actually destroyed? What else can I do? Since I don't know how to use makeup should I pay for those expensive permanent eyebrows instead? How fast do the hairs grow anyway? Sorry for all these questions and bad English and thank you kind people of this subreddit, your experiences made me realize I'm not alone and that maybe there's some hope for me as well!",

I‚Äôm 25 now. It‚Äôs true that at some point your hair follicles will stop producing hair if you pick a lot but it depends on the person. My hair still grows back and I have a very severe case. I just try to apply castor oil to my lashes and brows every day at night, if I can twice a day. I‚Äôm going to be honest with you, there‚Äôs no magic cure that will\nHelp and I‚Äôve been told by medical professionals that to some degree despite therapy and meds you will have to deal with it for the rest of your life. Don‚Äôt waste your money on expensive treatments, though the one I would receive if I had the money would be microblading (permanent brows). If you end up with literally no lashes as I have, I tend to stray away from serums in fear of them getting into my eye since there‚Äôs no hair there to protect it. Stick with castor oil for now. Lashes will grow back in 6 weeks but brows will take a little longer. It has taken me a long time to accept I‚Äôm stuck with this but fck others if they‚Äôre going to judge me off of that - that does NOT mean I‚Äôm not insecure or it doesn‚Äôt keep me from doing things because it does.

I wear headsets alot so I'm working on preventing acne around the ear cuffs which has mild out but I'm about to start trying to clean the ear cuffs every day or every otherday.\n\nIf anyone's struggling with acne and are lost with products try tiege Hanley so you get an idea of the products you need and can get a skin care regimen going. \n\nAlso to get the product to last a month dont use more than it says I try to use less just as much as you need because you cant buy the items separately \n\n Good luck my dudes\n\nNow... for reddits specs get ready for the copy n paste\n\n1.

AM‚ÄîMorning Facial Moisturizer with SPF 20, 0.75 oz.\n\nAwarded The Skin Cancer Foundation Seal of Recommendation!\n\nTrust us‚ÄîEven tough guys need to show their skin some love. Enter our Morning Facial Moisturizer. Formulated to hydrate without being oily, this anti-aging and sun-protection rock star won‚Äôt leave your face looking or feeling greasy.\n\nOur Morning Facial Moisturizer is a key component of each Tiege Hanley system and designed for the health of your skin. Dry skin is prone to redness, itching and even breakouts. AM is formulated to work in tandem with our other products that have been carefully crafted to create a unique, highly effective and foolproof system when used habitually.\n\nActive Ingredients\n\nOctinoxate 5.5% - absorbs UVB rays\nAvobenzone 2.2% - protects from both UVA and UVB rays\nOctocrylene 2.0% - neutralizes UV radiation; boosts the effectiveness of Avobenzone\n\nKey Ingredients\n\nCalendula Extract calms and nourishes the skin\n\nPlantain Extract soothes the skin, promotes healing and minimizes risk of scarring\n\nLavandula Oil hydrates, reduces redness and fights off Cutibacterium acnes, an acne-causing bacteria strain\n\nRosemary Leaf Oil‚ÄØprotects the skin while also offering antiseptic properties\n\n\n\nACNE - Daily Moisturizing Acne Cream, 0.85 oz.\n\nOur Acne Cream is charged with Salicylic Acid, one of the best raw materials for fighting acne. Because Salicylic Acid is more effective in a moisturizer than a wash, ACNE is one of the best acne treatments available for men. This active ingredient sheds away the top layer of skin cells to visibly reduce the size of acne and blackheads. The moisturizer formulation enhances penetration while also minimizing dryness.\n\nOur chemist is a smart guy. Knowing that diet and excessive washing are NOT the answer to treating acne, he formulated an effective topical treatment that works as good as (or better!) than expensive dermatology treatments and harsh prescription products. The secret? Putting the active ingredient‚Äî Salicylic Acid‚Äîin a moisturizer so that it stays on the skin long enough to knock out acne.\n\nOur Daily Moisturizing Acne Cream is available in both our Acne 1 and 2 skin care systems and formulated to work in tandem with our other products that have been carefully crafted to create a unique, highly effective and foolproof system when used habitually.\n\nActive Ingredient Salicylic Acid - exfoliates the skin to unclog pores, reduces the appearance of acne scars and prevents future breakouts\n\nKey Ingredients Plantain Extract, KuKui Nut Oil\n\nPlantain Extract promotes wound healing, helps the skin regenerate, reduces the chance of scarring and aids in the overall reduction of acne\n\nKuKui Nut Oil moisturizes and protects without clogging pores\n\n\nNow the consistency of the products are light and creamy except for the scrub which smells like menthol and is thicker.\n\nThe acne doesnt have a smell but the am moisturizer and the wash have a herbal willowy smell, masculine.\n\nI've been using for 3 months it took like 2 month for me to adapt to doing it every day now I enjoy the smells and the product so much that I'll be using this for life unless I find a better product.\n\nMy facial acne has gone away but my chest acne hasn't which makes me think it might be a detergent in my clothes but I also dont use the tiege Hanley products on my chest except for a little bit of the acne.  But medically speaking acne on your chest is different then your facial acne I think I read somewhere so thinking something for facial acne will work on your chest may be fallible.\nAnd where the ear cuffs from where my headsets sits the acne is still there so I've been starting to practice cleaning my headset frequently like the past 4 days b4 writing this review. With isopropyl alcohol and  50/50.  But I used to get it in the the top part of my \"tzone\"???? Which too me from my understanding was above my eyebrows and In between my eye brows and hair line. \n\nThe packaging is in a 6x4x2 black box that says tiege when you open it theres green tissue paper and your product I throw mine away because its card board and dont want to worry about keeping it dry. Good for shipping bad for storage.\n\nThe pros are the stuff smells masculine feel really nice on your skin, doesnt over dry it. The cons are the usage amount, the instructions with the box say use a certain amount but I would use as much as you need and less then what they say. Also it might be wise to buy a non oily sunblock for your face in case the am moisturizer which is spf 15 I think runs out or to go back and forth. If you use the acne in the morning.\n\nRemember you cant buy the product separately which to me is the major con. That's why I would buy another product if I could find a set created by a same brand or company but at a retailer.\n\nThis set was $45 but that was the acne system level two. If you dont have acne but want to adopt a skin care system the $25 one used the same stuff except instead of the acne they provide a PM moisturizer which I cant attest too because I havnt used it.  But it has no SALICYLIC acid in so its probably easier kn your skin.  The higher levels of the skin care system have eye cream and firming serum which I know nothing g about havnt used it.\n\nJust remember theres two systems ACNE and SKIN CARE. which have almost the same base ingredients but the skin care doesnt have the SALICYLIC acid",

Generally things that contain silicone substances can buildup easily in hair, and will usually require a stronger surfectant to remove.\n\nThe amodimethicone would be water soluble if it had both trideceth-12 AND centrimonium chloride, but it seems to be missing the chloride part of the equation so I would say that is a likely culprit. \n\nAlso the divinyldimethicone/dimethicone copolymer is water insoluble, which needs a stronger surfectant to remove.",

    "body": "Hello,\n\nI've been following a simple routine consistently for about a month, just cleanser and toner w/salicylic acid, added a moisturiser for about a week, then switched that and added a spot-on acne gel. Just wondering if some products of the ones I have are better than others, if some might be a bad idea and need switching, and what to be looking to add in. Maybe some from The Ordinary? I understand I need to go slowly, so if you tell me 'wait a few weeks, then add [product]', I can do that. I am, Ok, tempted to try some kind of drastic acid peel-all-the-skin-dramatically-off treatment in the vague hope of getting to start with a cleaner slate, but I guess that's probably not wise?\n\nIf there's anything I should do with spacing/timing and order to use things in, please suggest that too, I'm just layering products. Should I still be using everything first if I'm going to put make-up on in the morning too?\n\nAge: 33\n\nSkin type: Combination I think, but so oily on face it might as well just be oily\n\nConcerns: Acne, probs. hormonal, suspect seb derm which may be related issue (have salicylic acid shampoo). Noticeable sebaceous filaments. Visible oiliness. Some redness. One very fine line, may be vertical frown line, may be a scar.\n\nMake-up: Only recently got any again, have rarely used it.\n\nSuitability requirements: Vegan\n\nOther notes: I quit using products before as a teen because it wasn't working. The only thing that has ever made a significant ongoing difference, as a happy and unexpected side-effect, was switching to a dairy-free diet. I really don't like that one fine line due to the placement. I get that 'pores are normal', but the visibility makes me want to do something drastic involving strong acid. I have nerve damage so anything I use is prone to feel tingly/burny, making it hard to use that as a gauge, but my skin doesn't actually seem very sensitive in terms of real reactions to products. Not sure it absorbs products well. I'm not using SPF at present because I'm most often housebound currently, but feel free to advise on how to add this in for times that's not the case.\n\nCurrent products:\n\n**Cleansers**\n\nPrevise Dermapothecary Purify Botanic Wash\n\nI've liked this. Noticeable improvement just from using it and the toner dabbed on the worst problem areas, it seems to have fixed the flaky itchy skin under my eyebrows, skin is softer. Possibly pretty much anything would've had the same result, admittedly. The instructions don't actually say to wash it off with water, so, eh...?\nDid not seem to help with removing new mascara, as it dawned on me that I was not actually sure *how* to remove mascara.\n\nIngredients: Water, Algae Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Xantham Gum, Pentylene Glycol, Helianthus Anthus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Quillaja Saponaria Bark Extract, Organic Cedrus Atlantica (Cedarwood) Oil, Organic Citrus Aurantium Dulcis Peel Oil, Diglycerin, Polyglycerol-2 Laurate, Citric Acid, Silver Citrate\n\nSukin Clearing Facial Wash\n\nNot yet used.\n\nIngredients: Water (Aqua), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Cydonia Oblonga Leaf Extract (Quince), Punica Granatum Fruit Extract (Pomegranate), Epilobium Angustifolium Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (Willowherb), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract (Green Tea/White Tea), Moringa Oleifera Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Glycerin, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Eucalyptus Citriodora Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Limonene, Linalool\n\n**Toner/Salicylic Acid**\n\nSukin Pore Perfecting Toner\n\nSmells satisfyingly medicinal, but results have varied from 'I'm almost sure this is helping' to 'I'm not sure this is doing a darn thing', which is possibly just usual breakout fluctuation.\n\nIngedients: Water(Aqua), Glycerin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cydonia Oblonga Leaf Extract(Quince), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract(Green Tea/White Tea), Zingiber Officinale(Ginger)Root Extract, Mentha Piperita(Peppermint)Leaf Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Eucalyptus Citriodora Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia(Lavender)Oil, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Salicylic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-6 Oleate, Sodium Surfactin, Sorbic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Limonene, Linalool\n\nSukin Spot-Banishing Gel\n\nI was hoping this would have the same kind of near-instant spot drying-out effect I remembered from the gels I'd used as a teen, but while it might be a little better, eh, not really, so far.

Have you tried simpler ‚Äúdermatology‚Äù brands like Avene, La Roche Posay, Cerave, Cetaphil or at a cheaper high street level Simple? It may be worth reading up about some of these, they‚Äôre a staple on subs like this and obviously not everything works for every person but a lot of people see results when using their targeted but quite sensitively formulated products. For example the Sukin moisturiser says it‚Äôs oil free, which sounds great if you have oily skin, but there are a lot of plant extracts which can be quite reactive on some skin so could be less than ideal. Also I know it sounds strange but being oily is often to do with being dehydrated and your skin overcompensating, so you don‚Äôt always have to shy away from rich moisturising products - I didn‚Äôt use moisturiser at all for years because I thought it would make oily ness worse, but the moment I started to use a plain moisturiser my skin (including spots) was so much happier!\n\nI am waffling now, basically I don‚Äôt have very wise or specific words for you but you are definitely taking the right approach but maybe products from different brands or with simpler formulas might help? It‚Äôs such a pain figuring this stuff out, I wish you luck!",

If it's entirely safe then I'm fine with the $30.

        "body": "Just some insight - Tea tree oil is great at ridding the skin of bacteria and such, if you have acne that's the best natural choice. Chamomile and lavender are anti-inflammatory - reduce swelling and redness. The tea tree oil soap you picked is good, but honestly I'd take a look at Thursday Plantation's tea tree oil soap or Desert essence's tea tree therapy soap (both in bar form). (see below as to why)\n\nI actually used Desert essence's thoroughly clean facewash for a bit and didn't really help my skin. The ingredients you listed aren't up to date if I remember correctly - the bottle I had had lots more variety in the way of oil extracts. IMO this takes away from the quality - keep it simple and search for products with higher Tea tree oil concentration - i.e. higher up on the ingredients list. For this reason I'm not a fan of the tea tree oil soap you posted from trader joes.",

I had a shower and washed my face with my usual cleanser (CosRX Low pH Good Morning Cleanser) and let my skin relax in the hot steam for a bit.\n\nOpening up the packet I was hit with a pretty strong scent, which, looking at the ingredients list, I think was the rosemary oil. It was very strongly botanical with that herb-y sharpness. The mask itself is a clear, slightly milky, thick serum. Almost immediately after I applied some to my face, it started stinging badly. And not in an 'ooo, so fresh!' sort of way. I washed it off right away with cool water, and it looks like I got it off quickly enough not to cause any lingering redness or irritation. I wouldn't have tolerated it for two minutes, much less thirty like the packet says.\n\nHas anyone tried this product or brand before? Did you get this same result? I use the Reverence hand cream and love it but this is the first real face care stuff I've tried from this brand. Everything looks so luxe and well-designed but if it's all too harsh for me... pout.\n\nThis is what Aesop says about it: *Intensely hydrating facial masque formulated to refresh, soothe, and replenish normal and dry skin. Once or twice weekly, apply an even layer over the face and neck and leave for up to thirty minutes. Gently wipe away excess with a warm damp cloth.*\n\nAnd the ingredients: water, glycereth-26, PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil, witch hazel water, niacinamide, ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP copolymer, coco-caprylate, pentaerythrityl tetraisostearate, phenoxyethanol, trideceth-9, bisabolol, PEG-5 ethylhexanoate, panthenol, rosemary leaf oil, lavender oil, benzoic acid, dehydroacetic acid, ethylhexylglycerin, chamomile flower oil, citric acid, sodium carrageenan, ginger root extract, sea salt, linalool, d-limonene.\n\nDoes anything stand out as a potential irritant or allergen? I'm not entirely sure what all I'm looking at, here, lots of words I'm not familiar with yet.\n\nI love this subreddit, by the way! I must check it every day... am learning so much! Thanks in advance for your thoughts. :)",

    "body": ">If you're looking for ways to support hair growth, especially in cases of male pattern baldness, several supplements can make a significant difference. These work by providing the body with essential nutrients, reducing DHT, and promoting healthier scalp conditions. Below, I‚Äôll outline the key vitamins, minerals, and plant-based supplements that can help men looking to combat hair thinning in 2024.\n\n# Key Vitamins for Hair Growth\n\n1. **Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)**\n   * **How it Helps**: Vitamin B6 supports protein metabolism, essential for hair health. It also helps regulate hormones, balancing the effects of DHT on hair follicles.\n   * **Sources**: Available in both supplement form and in foods like fish, potatoes, and bananas.\n2. **Vitamin B9 (Folic Acid)**\n   * **How it Helps**: Folic acid promotes cell growth and helps generate red blood cells, delivering oxygen and nutrients to hair follicles.\n   * **Sources**: Found in green leafy vegetables, citrus fruits, and beans.\n3. **Vitamin D**\n   * **How it Helps**: Vitamin D supports immune health and hair follicle function. Deficiency has been linked to alopecia, so maintaining adequate levels is essential.\n   * **Sources**: You can boost levels with sunlight, fortified dairy products, and supplements.\n4. **Vitamin E**\n   * **How it Helps**: Vitamin E‚Äôs antioxidant properties reduce oxidative stress on the scalp, creating a healthier environment for hair growth.\n   * **Sources**: Found in nuts, seeds, and green leafy vegetables.\n\n# Essential Minerals for Hair Growth\n\n1. **Zinc**\n   * **How it Helps**: Zinc supports protein synthesis and hormonal balance, reducing the negative effects of DHT. It also has antioxidant properties that protect scalp health.\n   * **Sources**: Oysters, beef, and pumpkin seeds are rich in zinc.\n2. **Selenium**\n   * **How it Helps**: Selenium‚Äôs antioxidant effects help reduce inflammation on the scalp. It also supports hair follicle maintenance.\n   * **Sources**: Brazil nuts, eggs, and tuna.\n3. **Copper**\n   * **How it Helps**: Copper promotes collagen production, which is vital for the structural integrity of hair follicles. It also aids in producing melanin, which gives hair its color.\n   * **Sources**: Shellfish, nuts, and whole grains.\n\n# Top Plant-Based Hair Growth Supplements\n\n1. **Saw Palmetto Berry Extract**\n   * **How it Helps**: Saw palmetto is a **natural DHT blocker**, commonly included in topical products and supplements. It reduces hair follicle sensitivity to DHT, slowing hair loss.\n   * **Usage**: This can be taken as a supplement or applied topically.\n2. **Pygeum Bark Extract**\n   * **How it Helps**: Another DHT blocker, pygeum bark extract, is rich in phytosterols that reduce the production of DHT, helping prevent further hair loss.\n   * **Usage**: Available in capsule form.\n3. **Broccoli Whole Plant Powder**\n   * **How it Helps**: Broccoli is high in **B vitamins**, particularly folate, which helps with scalp circulation and oxygenation. It also contains vitamin C, crucial for collagen production.\n   * **Usage**: Can be taken as a supplement or consumed through whole foods.\n4. **Tomato Fruit Powder**\n   * **How it Helps**: Rich in **lycopene**, this antioxidant improves scalp circulation and repairs cells, creating a better environment for hair growth.\n   * **Usage**: Can be added to food or taken as a supplement.\n5. **Maitake and Reishi Mushrooms**\n   * **How it Helps**: These mushrooms inhibit **5Œ±-reductase**, the enzyme responsible for converting testosterone to DHT. They also help manage stress, which can exacerbate hair loss.\n   * **Usage**: Available in powder or capsule form.\n6. **Juniper Berry and Rosemary Leaf Oil**\n   * **How it Helps**: These antioxidant-rich plant extracts promote a healthy scalp and hair regrowth. Rosemary also contains vitamin B6, which supports overall hair health.\n   * **Usage**: Can be applied directly to the scalp or taken as supplements.\n\n# FAQs About Hair Growth Supplements\n\n**Q: Can supplements alone cure male pattern baldness?**\n\n* **A**: Supplements alone cannot cure male pattern baldness. They are most effective when used in combination with **DHT blockers**, **topical treatments** (such as Minoxidil 5%), or **plant-based hair regrowth activators**.\n\n**Q: How long should I take supplements to see results?**\n\n* **A**: Hair growth is a slow process, and it can take **3 to 6 months** of consistent use to notice significant improvements.\n\n**Q: Should I consult a doctor before starting supplements?**\n\n* **A**: Yes, it‚Äôs always a good idea to consult a dermatologist or healthcare professional, especially if you have underlying health conditions or take medications.\n\n**Q: Are gummy hair supplements effective?**\n\n* **A**: Gummy supplements can be fun and easy to take, but they often lack the concentration of active ingredients needed to make a significant impact. Traditional capsules or tablets may offer better results.\n\n# Final Thoughts: The Best Approach to Combat Hair Loss\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking to promote hair regrowth and prevent further thinning, combining **vitamins, minerals, and natural DHT blockers** with proven topical treatments can provide significant benefits. While supplements can improve hair health, they work best when used as part of a **comprehensive hair care routine** tailored to your specific needs. Always consult a healthcare professional to find the best approach for you.\n\nDr. Harth",

Ok so I'll be honest that its the first time I've ever even heard of stuff like Tocopherol, Limonene, and Glyceryl Dihebenate so I might not be the most informed on those things, but as a general rule of thumb I don't trust things that sound like unnatural chemicals. All of the oils sound fine and the shea butter should be good too, but the rest of it sounds like it might be chemical heavy. Most of them are alcohols which might dry your beard out. Im not saying don't get it, it might be exactly what you want, but I would honestly look for something with all natural ingredients. Try just plain coconut oil, Its not my favorite, but it does the job if you don't have the money for something a little more pricey. If money isn't an issue look at Honest Amish, Beardbrand, and Grave Before Shave products. They have all natural ingredients and work very nicely.",

As long as the viscosity is low enough that means that if you just directly mix them everything should combine nicely, minimal stirring required!\nHowever, I'm not sure how great of an idea it is to mix products like this in general, there may be other factors that aren't clear just from the ingredients.",

You can get 10.56 % numbing cream which will be more comfortable.  You use a brush or spatula and spread it on and put cover with saran wrap for 45 to 60 mins.  Don't buy anything injectable off of Amazon, you don't know who it is coming from and you cannot verify it is safe.  Don't put anything on your freshly MN face for a minimum of 24 to 48 hours (even water). Maybe a mask or some arnica salve.  \n\n  \nExosomes are good to MN with but if you order Velatox and Ronas Stem Cells you will be healed in two or 3 days.",

I'll be going through the beginner's guide after this post, but I thought I would ask about this since I didn't see anywhere using the search feature.\n\n\"prsprwellness Root revive hair growth oil\" is the product. He claims this mix of ingredients is what reversed his hair loss so he decided to put it all into one bottle.\n\n**INGREDIENTS:**  \n  \nRicinus communis Seed Oil (Castor Oil), Cucurbita Pepo Oil (Pumpkin Seed Oil), Prunus Armeniaca Oil (Apricot Kernel Oil), Vitis Vinifera Seed Oil (Grapeseed Oil), Persea Gratissima Oil (Avocado Oil), Olea europaea Fruit Oil (Olive Oil), Nigella Sativa Seed Oil (Black Seed Oil), Emblica Officinalis Fruit Extract (Amla), Bacopa Monnieri Leaf Extract (Brahmi), Trigonella Foenum Graecum Seed Extract (Fenugreek), Mentha Piperita Leaf Oil (Peppermint), Rosmarinus Officinalis Leaf Oil (Rosemary), Lavandula Angustifolia Flower Oil (Lavender)\n\nI never trust products I see on social media, but I really wanted to ask about it to get a definitive answer, and maybe so others can run into this post later when they search it up :)",
