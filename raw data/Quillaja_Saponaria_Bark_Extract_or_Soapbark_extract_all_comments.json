I read your earlier post on Top 10-20 Cleansing Oils & Gels also. \n\nI'm looking to introduce a new cleanser to my daily routine and was playing with the idea of an oil cleanser.  So much choice, but this should make it easier.  Ideally, I'm looking for something without propylene glycol. butylene glycol, essential oils or added fragrance.  And no parabens - was shocked to see Phytomer still incorporating these!  The ATrue Black Tea Cleanser in your previous post looked interesting; simple list of ingredients, although ironically green tea is the first ingredient in the list, rather than black tea!  Aromatica Orange Cleansing Sherbet looks interesting, as does Clinique - so simple but effective.  Have you any idea what Kakadu (reference Sidmool) means??\n\nWhich do you use incidentally?

I think people are \"desensitized\" to the marketing/labeling w/r/t percentages of acids because of the Ordinary pushing their dumb MAX PERCENTAGE MINIMUM PH nonsense, but I bet this will be a nice starter acid toner, an alternative to something like the Pixi Glow Tonic with a bit MORE oomph (as the pH is lower.) I personally might try it out as an alternative to my CosRX AHA/BHA Toner (although they are not the same and the CosRX is more like the Pixi in that its more inert/less active.) I do already use a 14% glycolic product several days a week, so not sure if I want to put my money in another product that uses glycolic alone. I am excited by the yeast extract- I love everything with yeast. \n\nAlso so excited that neither product contains niacinamide, though I'm sure whatever she makes next will have it!",

I wonder how it'll be! It seems very gentle so far. Maybe I'll wake up tomorrow with smoother skin, ready to sweat it up again in this humidity!

I found *it*. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSkin type: normal-dry\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a low pH cleanser, you don't need much (I always use more than i should at night). Everytime I use it my face is visibily brighter, cleaner, fresher, all those adjectives. This cleanser makes me glow. AND if i have a pimple it's visibly reduced after just one use. The pimple's not gone but it is smaller and after 2 days *it is* gone. This cleanser does not dry me out at allllllll. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a godsend i need everyone to try it. I was kinda hesitant to try this because most of the reviewers I watched had oily skin but I honestly think any skin type can use this and see results. (I don't have every skin type so could be wrong. Edit: i was wrong) I don't think I'm gonna search for another cleanser like ever. I'm hesitant to call anything a HG but this is my HG. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIngrediants:  \n\nCamellia Sinensis Leaf Water, Water, Glycerin, Coco-Betaine, Methyl Gluceth-10, Ethoxydiglycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Sodium Chloride, Butoxydiglycol, Diglycerin, Glycereth-26, Xanthan Gum, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Powder, Quillaja Saponaria Bark Extract, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Cannabis Sativa (Hemp) Seed Oil, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Diethoxydiglycol, Coco-Glucoside, Caprylyl Glycol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Decyl Glucoside, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Butylene Glycol, Octanediol, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Citric Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sodium PCA, Disodium EDTA\n\n*\\* Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser contains 40% of Matcha and is formulated with pH of 5.0-6.0 (pH may vary by batch). All KraveBeauty products are vegan-friendly, cruelty-free, and formulated without fragrance, essential oil, colorant. The color of the product might vary by batch or even change over time. Rest assured, this will not affect the product’s effectiveness; it remains completely safe for your skin.*",

Other than that I have reviewed everything from the line and the hits have been the Beet Shield and Great Barrier Relief. One miss (for me) was the Oat So Simple Water Cream…and I’m sorry to say this cleanser is another.\n\nThe Match Hemp Hydrating Cleanser is a thick/jelly-like water based cleanser that focuses on mild cleansing while imparting some hydration to the skin. Featured ingredients here include Green Tea Leaf Water, Green Tea Leaf Powder, Hemp Seed Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Oat Kernel Extract, and Soapbark Extract. There are little “bits” of what I think is the Green Tea Leaf Powder floating around in the jelly here and there…which ads to the interesting look of this amber/green jelly.\n\nMy first impressions of this cleanser were pretty positive. I was intrigued by the texture…and that was only heightened when I applied it to damp skin. This jelly doesn’t really “break down” in water right away like a typical water based cleanser. Rather, it almost smoothes out and creates a really slippery/slidery (LOL) layer that is actually kind of fun to play with. After about 10-15 seconds or so…the Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser does foam up slightly and become more “traditional” in style. \n\nEven with the lower amount of foam or lather, I found this cleanser to be decent at removing any residual impurities left behind by my first step cleanser (or by itself in my AM routine). I even began taking to adding just a bit of this to a whip maker that I use…creating a much more intense lather. I usually only did this in my AM routine as that is when I take a shower (and the whip maker lives in the shower/I’m too lazy to grab it at night). Either way, I got pretty much the same result with both methods. \n\nAlthough I didn’t really feel like this cleanser was “hydrating” my skin…it didn’t feel like it was drying or stripping in any way. That was until about two-three weeks into the trial.\n\nI began to notice a slight dry/tight feeling around my jaw line and forehead after using the Match Hemp Hydrating Cleanser after a few weeks. It wasn’t an all at once/glaring problem, but maybe just after my AM routine and then a day or two later in my PM routine…I just felt like I couldn’t even make it to my actives or toner without feeling kind of dry. Of course other factors play in to the inconsistency…some days I had just exfoliated the night before and others I had maybe used a poor sunscreen during the day (hi Cell Fusion!). But where other pH balanced/gentle cleansers dont intensify the effect…over time the Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser did.\n\nBy then end of my trial I was really looking forward to moving this cleanser out of my routine. I don’t want to knock or “ call out” the scent here…but I am. Krave Beauty doesn’t use synthetic fragrance and this product is essential oil free as well which is honestly a great thing. But the scent that does come through (for me) is kind of “industrial” in a way LOL…I guess kind of like plastic. Its not unbearable by any means, but for me it wasn’t great. Each time I used this product I looked back to my time with the Sulwhasoo Snowise EX Brightening Cleansing Foam as a very fond (although essential oil filled) memory. \n\nAside from all of that (results, scent)…I think I just have to come clean and say I don’t think these thicker/jelly style cleansers are for me in general. I wrote my review of the Then I Met You Soothing Tea Cleansing Gel in 2018 and going back to it now I was shocked by how similar my review of that product was compared to what you’ve just read. “Texture is thick/unique, smells okay, made my skin dry after a while…”…literally the same flow and talking points (although I hope I have improved my skincare review game in that time). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dgkfl4slnmt41.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0629b1c0fd6de31259da451ee33d2fc741e91bf2\n\nSo, I’m not sure what it is. I could try cutting back to only one water cleanse a day or maybe I need to change how much I use (about a large pea sized amount…which probably only makes sense in my head LOL). Or, maybe the formulation of these thicker water based cleansers just doesn’t agree with my skin for whatever reason. Regardless, I just don’t see myself coming back to this product or being able to wholeheartedly recommend it. I have one more (actually two since I bought it during a 1+1 sale on Jolse) cleanser that from what I’ve seen matches this style…its the OneOSeven Low pH Chaga Cleanser and I’m hoping it will change my mind.\n\nAnyone looking for a gentle and effective hydrating cleanser with the added boost of antioxidants/calming (which the Matcha/Green Tea in this Krave Beauty cleanser offers) should really check out the Youth To The People Superfood Cleanser. To me, it is superior in nearly every way. I found that product to be very gentle and hydrating to the point that it almost doubled as a toner for me. The consistency, texture when lathering, and application were also much more my style (decent amount of lather from a thinner product). And, the fresh cut greenery/refreshing scent is really something special. All of that in a product that costs just slightly more per oz than the Krave Beauty Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser.\n\nI hear so many people rave about this product and it feels so wrong to go against the grain here. But I felt the same way about the Then I Met You cleanser…not for me.\n\nFull Ingredients List: \n\nCamellia Sinensis Leaf Water, Water, Glycerin, Coco-Betaine, Methyl Gluceth-10, Ethoxydiglycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Sodium Chloride, Butoxydiglycol, Diglycerin, Glycereth-26, Xanthan Gum, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Powder, Quillaja Saponaria Bark Extract, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Cannabis Sativa (Hemp) Seed Oil, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Diethoxydiglycol, Coco-Glucoside, Caprylyl Glycol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Decyl Glucoside, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Butylene Glycol, Octanediol, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Citric Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sodium PCA, Disodium EDTA\n\nWhere To Buy (Krave Beauty Site $16.00 USD): [https://kravebeauty.com/collections/shop-all/products/matcha-hemp-hydrating-cleanser](https://kravebeauty.com/collections/shop-all/products/matcha-hemp-hydrating-cleanser)",

This is going to be a very thorough post on my very bullish  prediction on Novavax (NVAX) and conspiracy theory on why it is nowhere  near where it should be. Please note that I am not a financial advisor  or telling you what to do with your money. I am just telling you where I  am going full ape.\n\nPreview:  This DD will cover a small biotech, NVAX, who currently has one of the  better vaccine solutions with the least amount of side effects to combat  covid-19 and its variants and somehow the world is unaware of this. Key  points bulleted below.\n\n\\* This is a more traditional alternative to the mRNA vaccines that contain genetic materials\n\n\\* Covid vaccine can be stored at normal refrigerating temperatures\n\n\\* Will have solution to combat Omicron variant by January\n\n\\* Emergency use approval in: 1.

Background**\n\nFor  those of you that are not aware of this company, simply put they are a  small biotech based out of Maryland. Prior to March of 2020 they  developed experimental vaccines for Ebola, influenza, respiratory  syncytial virus, and other emerging infectious diseases. Please note  'influenza' is where they had been working heavily prior to the covid-19  outbreak. In fact they had been working on Nanoflu (in a nut shell is a  more effective flu shot) which has shown to provide very effective  immune responses. When the world shut down and we got hit with the rona  they were in a good position to pivot and begin working on a vaccine to  save the world. You might wonder what is taking them so long? Simply  put, being a very small company with limited capital and resources they  couldn't compete with Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, or Moderna who just  so happen to be dominating the current market. However, the snails pace  development allowed them create a safer and more effective vaccine  versus the mRNA competition.\n\n**How does the Novavax vaccine work?**\n\nThe  Novavax COVID-19 vaccine contains a protein (made using moth cells)  plus an adjuvant (made from tree bark). An adjuvant is an ingredient  added to boost a person's immune response, creating higher levels of  antibodies.\n\nThe  Novavax vaccine uses a telltale piece of the coronavirus: the notorious  spike protein. All alone, the spike protein is harmless and can't cause  COVID-19. When your immune system encounters the lonely spike protein,  it produces antibodies against it. This gives you protection against  future COVID-19 infection.\n\n\"Unlike  mRNA vaccines, the spike protein is already premade in the Novavax  vaccine. It's a shortcut,\" explains Dr. Florescu. \n\nLike  other COVID-19 vaccines, Novavax does not cause COVID-19 infection. It  can't get you sick. This vaccine doesn't contain either live or  inactivated virus.\n\nHow did they get the spike protein?\n\nThe Novavax method uses moth cells to make spike proteins:\n\nResearchers select the desired genes that create certain SARS-CoV-2 antigens (spike protein).\n\nResearchers put the genes into a baculovirus, an insect virus.\n\nThe baculovirus infects moth cells and replicates inside them.\n\nThese moth cells create lots of spike proteins.\n\nResearchers extract and purify the spike proteins.\n\n\"The  Novavax vaccine has no genetic material, only proteins,\" says Dr.  Florescu. \"The vaccine technology is more traditional, and it's very  similar to a protein-based influenza vaccine.\"\n\nInfluenza vaccines have also used this moth cell factory method.\n\nWhat does the adjuvant (soapbark tree extract) do?\n\nAdjuvants  increase the immune response to a vaccine. In this vaccine, soapbark  tree extract adjuvant makes achieving immunity possible with a smaller  dose of the spike protein.\n\nMatrix-M  is the adjuvant used by Novavax. It is based on a saponin extracted  from the soapbark tree (Quillaja saponaria). The soapbark extract  encourages immune cells to activate, generating a more potent immune  response.\n\nSaponins  are found naturally in various plant species like beans and green peas.  They're used in agriculture, animal feeds, veterinary vaccines and  human food. Saponins can boost immune responses to proteins. Using the  Matrix-M adjuvant, a smaller dose of spike protein achieves the desired  immune response.\n\nsource: [https://www.nebraskamed.com/COVID/moths-and-tree-bark-how-the-novavax-vaccine-works](https://www.nebraskamed.com/COVID/moths-and-tree-bark-how-the-novavax-vaccine-works)\n\n**So just how effective was their vaccine in trials?**\n\nNovavax  is another highly effective COVID-19 vaccine. Infectious diseases  expert Diana Florescu, MD, led the phase 3 clinical trial of the Novavax  vaccine at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC). \"It's  rewarding to help the development of a new vaccine,\" she says. \"The  research group was excited to bring this study to our community to help  curb the pandemic.\"\n\nResults of the clinical trial\n\n93%  effective against predominantly circulating variants: Against the alpha  (B.1.1.7) and beta (B.1.351) variants, plus other variants of  concern/variants of interest, Novavax had 93% efficacy. The Novavax  vaccine had 100% efficacy against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain.\n\nVery  good protection against mild disease: Novavax's overall vaccine  efficacy was 90.4%. All cases in the vaccine group were mild.\n\nFull protection against severe disease: The Novavax vaccine had 100% efficacy against moderate and severe disease.\n\nSide effects\n\nCommon  side effects were injection site pain and tenderness, fatigue, headache  and muscle pain. These typically lasted less than three days.\n\nWho was in the clinical trial?\n\nOver  29,000 people participated in the trial. UNMC was one of 113 sites in  the United States. \"We're grateful to all participants for their help,\"  says Dr. Florescu. \"Major medical breakthroughs could not happen without  the generosity of the trial participants.\"\n\n\"People  were so enthusiastic to participate,\" says Dr. Florescu. \"One family  included every family member in the trial. Grandparents, parents and  children – all three generations – took part in it.\" Thirteen percent  were older than 65, a high-risk age group for severe COVID-19.\n\nThe trial also included people from multiple backgrounds:\n\n20% Latino/Latina\n\n12% African American\n\n7% Native American\n\n5% Asian American\n\nsource: [https://www.nebraskamed.com/COVID/novavax-vaccine-results-how-effective-is-it-against-variants](https://www.nebraskamed.com/COVID/novavax-vaccine-results-how-effective-is-it-against-variants)\n\n**2. Market Opportunities**\n\nNovavax  is targeting distribution to lower/middle income nations first. Why?  Because their vaccine is extremely cheap to make unlike the mRNA  vaccines and they are actually looking to stop the spread. Plus they  know the mRNA (Pfizer and Moderna) vaccines are not working. The world  population is 7.9 billion people and right now only 42.7% are fully  vaccinated with a vaccine that doesn't even work and can potentially  cause severe side effects. That leaves about 4.5 billion people who have  not received a vaccine. And don't forget that boosters are being pushed  now. So in theory at minimum that is 3 doses per person approximately  13.5 billion doses (for those that have not been vaccinated). Now of  course it's safe to assume a good percent won't receive any vaccine ever  and Pfizer/Moderna will still receive a big chunk, but even a small 20%  cut could lead to billions in profit for NVAX. And if those that have  been vaccinated opt for the NVAX booster that's an additional 3.4  billion people.\n\nHow  will this small biotech manufacture enough doses? Well they are ramping  up and have the capacity at minimum to produce 200 million doses per  month. The manufacturing capacity in place is as follows (these numbers  add up to well over 4 bil per year and reflect max capacity):\n\nSerum Institute of India - 2 billion doses annually\n\nNovavax CZ - 1 billion doses annually\n\nFujifilm Diosynth US - 300 million annually\n\nTakeda Pharmaceutical - 250 million annually\n\nSK Bioscience - 150 million annually\n\nFujifilm Diosynth UK - 180 million annually\n\nBiofabri - 100 million annually\n\nMabion - 120 million annually\n\nNational Research Council - 24 million annually\n\nThe  US provided NVAX with $1.6 billion in exchange for 100 million doses in  2020 as part of Operation Warp Speed which puts a price tag of $16 per  dose. I am thinking that this is on the higher end and the rest of the  world would probably bring an average price to around $10 (my guess ).\n\nSo  at a minimum of 200 million per month at $10 that's $24 billion in  revenue which should at least double the current market cap of 12.2  billion bringing the share price to around $324. As of right now there  are multiple price targets hovering around the $305 mark from actual  analysts.\n\nIf  they are manufacturing and selling 4.1 billion doses annually (as  indicated above) we could see revenue in the $41 billion area. That  would bring it to a share price of around $544.\n\nNaturally,  I'm bullish as fuck on this company and I think we will soon see half  the market cap of Moderna who NVAX was initially running toe to toe with  in producing the vaccine. At a market cap of $61 billion the share  price would be around $809.\n\nLet's  be honest, the covid shit isn't going away and I would be willing to  bet that it will become a seasonal thing similarly to the flu.  Fortunately, Novavax has had success coupling their covid-19 vaccine  with Nanoflu. This would be the ultimate kill 2 birds with one stone  cocktail that most people would prefer to take and could be a catalyst  for the stock price.\n\n**3. The Conspiracy Theory**\n\nSo  you might be wondering why the fuck you've never heard of this company  if their vaccine's so great? The truth is that Pfizer has done  everything that they can to keep NVAX out of the media - similar to  getting shadowbanned on social media. He who controls the media controls  the narrative and right now Pfizer is pushing their shitty vaccine and  more boosters that are now 'safe' for kids. I don't believe any of that  bullshit. Personally my wife took the Johnson & Johnson (not mRNA)  vaccine and then caught covid a few weeks later. She still experienced  all the symptoms - fatigue, fever, chills, loss of taste/smell, etc. I  had not been vaccinated and she spread it to me and I experienced the  same shit. My sister took the Pfizer vaccine and caught the rona a week  later and was extremely sick for about a week. Lastly, a colleague of  mine who took the Moderna vaccine experienced extreme reactions to both  shots, still got covid, and has now been diagnosed with Rheumatoid  arthritis. What the fuck, these shitty mRNA vaccines aren't working and  Pfizer won't admit to it. Instead they come out with a new pill to help  you recover once you have covid. That makes zero sense because IF their  vaccine was effective there would be no need for a covid pill which  comes with severe side effects. This is the equivalent of going into the  condom manufacturing business and then your customers are complaining  because they're getting everyone pregnant because your condoms don't  work and so the solution is to provide plan-b? Personally I'd prefer to  risk it and just raw dog it, but that's me.\n\nMoving  on to how Pfizer is fucking with Novavax. For those of you not aware  Pfizer worked closely with BioNTech developing the vaccine. On October  19th an article was released by Politico ([https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/19/novavax-vaccine-rush-process-global-campaign-516298](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/19/novavax-vaccine-rush-process-global-campaign-516298)) simply bashing the company and their manufacturing failures, which Novavax positively responded to the very next day ([https://ir.novavax.com/Novavax-Reconfirms-Confidence-in-Regulatory-Filing-Timelines-and-Manufacturing-Quality](https://ir.novavax.com/Novavax-Reconfirms-Confidence-in-Regulatory-Filing-Timelines-and-Manufacturing-Quality)). Coincidentally this article road on the coat tails of the purchase of Politico by Axel Springer ([https://www.axelspringer.com/en/ax-press-release/axel-springer-completes-acquisition-of-politico](https://www.axelspringer.com/en/ax-press-release/axel-springer-completes-acquisition-of-politico))  which just so happened to be finalized that exact same day. Politico is  purchased by Axel Springer and then a couple hours later the article is  released shitting on Novavax. And since then, they have released  additional slander that has negatively impacted the stock price of  Novavax.\n\nIf  you connect the dots you will see that the CEO of Axel Springer (German  company) has had strong ties to BioNTech (German biotech) since the  very beginning of their vaccine development. The red flag is that the  article released on Oct 19 in addition to others dating to present day  are being published as Novavax begins submitting for approval to the  World Health Organization (WHO), European Union (EU), UK, Australia,  Canada, New Zealand, Switzerland, India for the Emergency Use  Authorization (EUA). Oddly enough, the articles all have 'anonymous'  sources without a single credible source being named.\n\n$1  billion is a drop in the bucket to bash a company when you have a  market cap of $306 billion and endless control over the media and  governments around the world. Every single time Novavax releases  positive news, within a few days an article is released bashing them OR  Pfizer happens to release some positive news about their covid related  products. What they don't want you to know is that they put in a request  to not release any of their covid related data to the public for the  next 55 years. What they don't want you to know is that some of their  data was skewed in their trials to receive an expedited approval. What  they don't want you to know is that Scott Gottlieb is a former FDA  commissioner in charge of regulating Pfizer is also on the board of  directors of Pfizer, Stephen Hahn is a former FDA commissioner in charge  of regulating Moderna is the current Chief Medical Officer of Flagship  Pioneering (the venture capital firm behind Moderna), and James C. Smith  who is the CEO of Reuters and is on the Board of Directors for Pfizer.  This is a major red flag to me.\n\nAnd  where the fuck do all these 'Main Stream' media outlets like CNN, CBS,  CNBC, Reuters, USA Today, The New York Times, Business Week, etc.  receive their advertising money from? Fucking Pfizer. Just check out  this short clip...\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC1h6l-eXJw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC1h6l-eXJw)\n\nAnd  I'd like to point out that government officials are well aware of  Novavax and it's effectiveness. Here is a very short clip recently by  Rand Paul indirectly referencing Novavax. Why he won't mention the name  of the company is beyond me.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzn045EtcQc&t=132s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzn045EtcQc&t=132s)\n\n**4. Summary**\n\nAfter  endless slander in the news and repeated short attacks (more than  likely by hedgies with money provided by Pfizer) the Novavax share price  has taken a serious hit and is very undervalued. Novavax has a solution  that will actually work, has no severe side effects, and soon the world  will know about it. As of writing this Australia expects to have a  final decision on NVAX ([https://twitter.com/TillaInvest/status/1466575400591507456?s=20](https://twitter.com/TillaInvest/status/1466575400591507456?s=20)) in the coming days.\n\nMy position is a total of 1396 shares that cost me $220,318.10 (See Screenshot Below).\n\nI am looking for some serious movement to the upside over the next 87 days. Do your DD and make the right choice.\n\nSide note, if you find any holes in this research, fill them in like my wifes BF does to her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z1g3xbnndg381.png?width=1578&format=png&auto=webp&s=4818b39ef13470b8601afba3925a08af4070c140",

I still have the Kale-alu-yAHA Toner in my stash to be used sometime this summer/fall though. Other than that I have reviewed everything from the line and the hits have been the Beet Shield and Great Barrier Relief. One miss (for me) was the Oat So Simple Water Cream…and I’m sorry to say this cleanser is another.\n\nThe Match Hemp Hydrating Cleanser is a thick/jelly-like water based cleanser that focuses on mild cleansing while imparting some hydration to the skin. Featured ingredients here include Green Tea Leaf Water, Green Tea Leaf Powder, Hemp Seed Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Oat Kernel Extract, and Soapbark Extract. There are little “bits” of what I think is the Green Tea Leaf Powder floating around in the jelly here and there…which ads to the interesting look of this amber/green jelly.\n\nMy first impressions of this cleanser were pretty positive. I was intrigued by the texture…and that was only heightened when I applied it to damp skin. This jelly doesn’t really “break down” in water right away like a typical water based cleanser. Rather, it almost smoothes out and creates a really slippery/slidery (LOL) layer that is actually kind of fun to play with. After about 10-15 seconds or so…the Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser does foam up slightly and become more “traditional” in style. \n\nEven with the lower amount of foam or lather, I found this cleanser to be decent at removing any residual impurities left behind by my first step cleanser (or by itself in my AM routine). I even began taking to adding just a bit of this to a whip maker that I use…creating a much more intense lather. I usually only did this in my AM routine as that is when I take a shower (and the whip maker lives in the shower/I’m too lazy to grab it at night). Either way, I got pretty much the same result with both methods. \n\nAlthough I didn’t really feel like this cleanser was “hydrating” my skin…it didn’t feel like it was drying or stripping in any way. That was until about two-three weeks into the trial.\n\nI began to notice a slight dry/tight feeling around my jaw line and forehead after using the Match Hemp Hydrating Cleanser after a few weeks. It wasn’t an all at once/glaring problem, but maybe just after my AM routine and then a day or two later in my PM routine…I just felt like I couldn’t even make it to my actives or toner without feeling kind of dry. Of course other factors play in to the inconsistency…some days I had just exfoliated the night before and others I had maybe used a poor sunscreen during the day (hi Cell Fusion!). But where other pH balanced/gentle cleansers dont intensify the effect…over time the Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser did.\n\nBy then end of my trial I was really looking forward to moving this cleanser out of my routine. I don’t want to knock or “ call out” the scent here…but I am. Krave Beauty doesn’t use synthetic fragrance and this product is essential oil free as well which is honestly a great thing. But the scent that does come through (for me) is kind of “industrial” in a way LOL…I guess kind of like plastic. Its not unbearable by any means, but for me it wasn’t great. Each time I used this product I looked back to my time with the Sulwhasoo Snowise EX Brightening Cleansing Foam as a very fond (although essential oil filled) memory. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/29zlo3kanmt41.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d081566bd104fc2e56f887caadc25376a7cb09b8\n\nAside from all of that (results, scent)…I think I just have to come clean and say I don’t think these thicker/jelly style cleansers are for me in general. I wrote my review of the Then I Met You Soothing Tea Cleansing Gel in 2018 and going back to it now I was shocked by how similar my review of that product was compared to what you’ve just read. “Texture is thick/unique, smells okay, made my skin dry after a while…”…literally the same flow and talking points (although I hope I have improved my skincare review game in that time). \n\nSo, I’m not sure what it is. I could try cutting back to only one water cleanse a day or maybe I need to change how much I use (about a large pea sized amount…which probably only makes sense in my head LOL). Or, maybe the formulation of these thicker water based cleansers just doesn’t agree with my skin for whatever reason. Regardless, I just don’t see myself coming back to this product or being able to wholeheartedly recommend it. I have one more (actually two since I bought it during a 1+1 sale on Jolse) cleanser that from what I’ve seen matches this style…its the OneOSeven Low pH Chaga Cleanser and I’m hoping it will change my mind.\n\nAnyone looking for a gentle and effective hydrating cleanser with the added boost of antioxidants/calming (which the Matcha/Green Tea in this Krave Beauty cleanser offers) should really check out the Youth To The People Superfood Cleanser. To me, it is superior in nearly every way. I found that product to be very gentle and hydrating to the point that it almost doubled as a toner for me. The consistency, texture when lathering, and application were also much more my style (decent amount of lather from a thinner product). And, the fresh cut greenery/refreshing scent is really something special. All of that in a product that costs just slightly more per oz than the Krave Beauty Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser.\n\nI hear so many people rave about this product and it feels so wrong to go against the grain here. But I felt the same way about the Then I Met You cleanser…not for me.\n\nFull Ingredients List: \n\nCamellia Sinensis Leaf Water, Water, Glycerin, Coco-Betaine, Methyl Gluceth-10, Ethoxydiglycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Sodium Chloride, Butoxydiglycol, Diglycerin, Glycereth-26, Xanthan Gum, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Powder, Quillaja Saponaria Bark Extract, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Cannabis Sativa (Hemp) Seed Oil, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Diethoxydiglycol, Coco-Glucoside, Caprylyl Glycol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Decyl Glucoside, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Butylene Glycol, Octanediol, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Citric Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sodium PCA, Disodium EDTA\n\nWhere To Buy (Krave Beauty Site $16.00 USD): [https://kravebeauty.com/collections/shop-all/products/matcha-hemp-hydrating-cleanser](https://kravebeauty.com/collections/shop-all/products/matcha-hemp-hydrating-cleanser)",

Upon moving out, she gifted me with what can only be called an industrial sized container of the Special Cleansing Gel and about 6 bottles of the Active Moist (she's...excessive, I know! Ack she really...really shouldn't have <3). So now it seems those are going to be my staple skincare products for a while.\n\n\nI was wondering what you all thought of these products and whether or not I should opt for something highly recommended by /SCA and /AB or stick with these items (my skin has zero reaction to them, neither great nor terrible. The cleansing gel foams nicely and from what I have gathered, has a neutral pH. The active moist is very light and leaves my skin slightly tacky once it dries -- I wouldn't say it's very \"plumping\")\n\nThank you for all your advice and information thus far!! <3 I'm excited to take my first plunge into true skin care :) \n\n\nEDIT: Oh! I should mention I have an oily/normal skin with hormonal acne, slightly enlarged pores in my oily areas, and PIE/PIH on my cheeks. I'm still in the beginning stages of figuring out what to do about all of this, haha. Any help would be greatly appreciated. \n\n\nAnd finally, I thought I would include an ingredient list for anyone who's interested:\n\nCleansing Gel: Water/Aqua/Eau, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Disodium Lauroamphodiacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Quillaja Saponaria Bark Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben.\n\nActive Moist:\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Methyl Gluceth-20, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Lactamide MEA, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Malva Sylvestris (Mallow) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract, Hedera Helix (Ivy) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Sambucus Nigra Flower Extract, Arnica Montana Flower Extract, Parietaria Officinalis Extract, Nasturtium Officinale Flower/Leaf Extract, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Saponaria Officinalis Leaf/Root Extract, Silk Amino Acids, Glycolipids, Sodium Hyaluronate, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Palmitoyl, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Amylopectin/Glycerin Crosspolymer, Lecithin, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Allantoin, Panthenol, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyquaternium-10, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polysorbate 60, Aminomethyl Propanol, Disodium EDTA, Linalool, Lavandula Hybrida Oil.",

As far as the PC goes, I really happen to enjoy the consistency and how long it lasts.  It's also very effective and runs over the face well.",

I will give it credit for not breaking me out, so at least it did no harm :)    It's just an ok moisturizer.

I am, Ok, tempted to try some kind of drastic acid peel-all-the-skin-dramatically-off treatment in the vague hope of getting to start with a cleaner slate, but I guess that's probably not wise?\n\nIf there's anything I should do with spacing/timing and order to use things in, please suggest that too, I'm just layering products. Should I still be using everything first if I'm going to put make-up on in the morning too?\n\nAge: 33\n\nSkin type: Combination I think, but so oily on face it might as well just be oily\n\nConcerns: Acne, probs. hormonal, suspect seb derm which may be related issue (have salicylic acid shampoo). Noticeable sebaceous filaments. Visible oiliness. Some redness. One very fine line, may be vertical frown line, may be a scar.\n\nMake-up: Only recently got any again, have rarely used it.\n\nSuitability requirements: Vegan\n\nOther notes: I quit using products before as a teen because it wasn't working. The only thing that has ever made a significant ongoing difference, as a happy and unexpected side-effect, was switching to a dairy-free diet. I really don't like that one fine line due to the placement. I get that 'pores are normal', but the visibility makes me want to do something drastic involving strong acid. I have nerve damage so anything I use is prone to feel tingly/burny, making it hard to use that as a gauge, but my skin doesn't actually seem very sensitive in terms of real reactions to products. Not sure it absorbs products well. I'm not using SPF at present because I'm most often housebound currently, but feel free to advise on how to add this in for times that's not the case.\n\nCurrent products:\n\n**Cleansers**\n\nPrevise Dermapothecary Purify Botanic Wash\n\nI've liked this. Noticeable improvement just from using it and the toner dabbed on the worst problem areas, it seems to have fixed the flaky itchy skin under my eyebrows, skin is softer. Possibly pretty much anything would've had the same result, admittedly. The instructions don't actually say to wash it off with water, so, eh...?\nDid not seem to help with removing new mascara, as it dawned on me that I was not actually sure *how* to remove mascara.\n\nIngredients: Water, Algae Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Xantham Gum, Pentylene Glycol, Helianthus Anthus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Quillaja Saponaria Bark Extract, Organic Cedrus Atlantica (Cedarwood) Oil, Organic Citrus Aurantium Dulcis Peel Oil, Diglycerin, Polyglycerol-2 Laurate, Citric Acid, Silver Citrate\n\nSukin Clearing Facial Wash\n\nNot yet used.\n\nIngredients: Water (Aqua), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Cydonia Oblonga Leaf Extract (Quince), Punica Granatum Fruit Extract (Pomegranate), Epilobium Angustifolium Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (Willowherb), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract (Green Tea/White Tea), Moringa Oleifera Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Glycerin, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Eucalyptus Citriodora Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Limonene, Linalool\n\n**Toner/Salicylic Acid**\n\nSukin Pore Perfecting Toner\n\nSmells satisfyingly medicinal, but results have varied from 'I'm almost sure this is helping' to 'I'm not sure this is doing a darn thing', which is possibly just usual breakout fluctuation.\n\nIngedients: Water(Aqua), Glycerin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cydonia Oblonga Leaf Extract(Quince), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract(Green Tea/White Tea), Zingiber Officinale(Ginger)Root Extract, Mentha Piperita(Peppermint)Leaf Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Eucalyptus Citriodora Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia(Lavender)Oil, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Salicylic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-6 Oleate, Sodium Surfactin, Sorbic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Limonene, Linalool\n\nSukin Spot-Banishing Gel\n\nI was hoping this would have the same kind of near-instant spot drying-out effect I remembered from the gels I'd used as a teen, but while it might be a little better, eh, not really, so far. Think might be a little drying.\n\nIngredients: Water (Aqua), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Epilobium Angustifolium Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (Willowherb), Cydonia Oblonga Leaf Extract (Quince), Salicylic Acid, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Moringa Oleifera Leaf Extract, Zingiber Officinal (Ginger) Root Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract (Chamomile), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract (Green Tea/White Tea), Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Eucalyptus Citriodora Oil, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Sorbic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Limonene, Linalool\n\n**Moisturiser**\n\nDr Organic Rose Otto Day Cream\n\nWas a little burny.

Have you tried simpler “dermatology” brands like Avene, La Roche Posay, Cerave, Cetaphil or at a cheaper high street level Simple? It may be worth reading up about some of these, they’re a staple on subs like this and obviously not everything works for every person but a lot of people see results when using their targeted but quite sensitively formulated products. For example the Sukin moisturiser says it’s oil free, which sounds great if you have oily skin, but there are a lot of plant extracts which can be quite reactive on some skin so could be less than ideal. Also I know it sounds strange but being oily is often to do with being dehydrated and your skin overcompensating, so you don’t always have to shy away from rich moisturising products - I didn’t use moisturiser at all for years because I thought it would make oily ness worse, but the moment I started to use a plain moisturiser my skin (including spots) was so much happier!\n\nI am waffling now, basically I don’t have very wise or specific words for you but you are definitely taking the right approach but maybe products from different brands or with simpler formulas might help? It’s such a pain figuring this stuff out, I wish you luck!",

    "body": "Dermalogica is a brand with great experience and a variety of products. A company that has long proven its products as effective. It has existed since 1986, so it is probably known to many, and a lot of people love and actively use its products. I chose three products that I saw on *the bestseller list*. \n\nThe first product, and probably the most famous, is the **Daily Microfoliant Exfoliator**. \n\nIt is a mild exfoliating product with very small, non-traumatic, abrasive particles. Besides abrasive, it contains ***papain*** and ***salicylic acid***. Papain is a plant-derived enzyme, found most in ***papaya***. It perfectly breaks down the bonds between *dead skin cells*, which makes them exfoliate and make the skin *smoother*.  Salicylic acid is an excellent keratolytic (exfoliates dead skin cells), and most importantly, it helps to clean pores, because only it can penetrate them, improving both the condition of the pores and the secretion of sebum. In fact, it's a great cocktail, even for every day. Still, if you have *sensitive skin*, the frequent use of exfoliants is not a good idea. If you have regular rashes (*acne*) or *rosacea*, it is better not to massage actively, just apply and wash off after a few minutes. The product also has ***licorice***, ***oat extract***, ***allantoin***, which will help soothe the skin. But it also contains ***grapefruit essential oil***, which is an unnecessary irritant for sensitive skin. Therefore, before applying it to the whole face, you should do a patch test on a small area of ​​skin.\n\nIt's very nice to see when an exfoliator is a bestseller because most often, the cause of dullness, roughness, clogged pores, acne (one of the reasons) is a violation of exfoliation of dead cells of the stratum corneum. Exfoliants, in turn, help this process and prevent unpleasant effects on the skin, giving, as a result, radiant and smooth skin.\n\nThe next product is **AGE Smart Dynamic Skin Recovery SPF 50**. Moisturizer with sun protection factor 50 (UVA and UVB). It is a completely chemical SPF cream ***Avobenzone*** (UVA) and ***Octinoxate*** (UVB) for any skin type, there are no risks even for oily skin. Although the product is suitable for any skin, it contains fragrance and essential oils, which, in our opinion, is absolutely inappropriate for *sensitive skin*, and generally in sunscreens. Still, some essential oils, under the influence of UV rays can be more aggressive in relation to the skin, although their concentration in products is extremely low. This product may replace your day cream (except for very dry skin). It contains several very useful active ingredients. They are ***Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5***, which both protect collagen from damage and stimulates its production, and ***Arginine / Lysine Polypeptide***, which also protects collagen from destruction. We think it's a good cocktail for daytime SPF. Of course, the product has vitamin E as well. I can also mention ***Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate and green tea extract***. I hope they are in sufficient concentration to soothe and protect the skin from damage (judging by the position in the list, they are in low concentration, and we would prefer more for this kind of product).\n\n**Special Cleansing Gel** is the third bestseller on the list. A combination of gentle cleansing ingredients + a source of natural saponins, ***Quillaja Saponaria Bark Extract***, natural emulsifiers that also help cleanse the skin. Suitable for absolutely any type of skin, both for light morning cleansing of the “pillow residue” and the second (or third) stage of cleansing long-lasting makeup or sunscreen, after balm or oil. There are no acids or other active components in the product that could complement it, (they are not always necessary in these kinds of products). Just a gentle cleansing, nothing more. True, there is an abundance of essential oils, so it smells delicious, but the owners of sensitive skin still need to be careful. ",

    "body": "On Thursday I started using Dermalogica special cleansing gel, it felt gentler than my normal cleanser and I didn’t have any bad reaction on my face. I’ve been waking up with little whiteheads every day for months and the 2 days I used the dermalogica cleanser I didn’t wake up with any new ones.\n\nOn Friday night I used Bioderma atoderm eye cream around my eyes and woke up Saturday morning and noticed darkness on the outer corner of my eye but I thought nothing of it. I had been using this product earlier this year for a few months and had no reaction to it but I hadn’t used it since then. So I used the dermalogica cleanser and eye cream again yesterday and after washing my face and applying the eye cream straight after I noticed my whole eye area was red and wrinkly. I immediately washed the cream off and last night I used my normal cleanser instead, avoiding my eye area but today I’ve woken up with both eyes swollen, red and itchy. \n\nI’m just wondering if anyone knows what one of these products could have caused this. I know it could be anything but I’ve heard of eyelid dermatitis caused by acrylates so I was thinking maybe it could be the Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer in the eye cream but I’m not sure. \n\nHere are the ingredients\nDermalogica cleansing gel \nWater/Aqua/Eau, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Quillaja Saponaria Bark Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Cymbopogon Nardus (Citronella) Oil, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Coco-Betaine, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Capryloyl Glycine, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Methylpropanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA.\n\nBioderma eye cream \nAqua/Water/Eau, Glycerin, Paraffinum Liquidum/Mineral Oil/Huile Minerale, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Dipropylene Glycol, Brassica Campestris (Rapeseed) Seed Oil, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Sucrose Stearate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycyrrhetinic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Polysorbate 60, Sorbitan Isostearate, Mannitol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Xylitol, Citric Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Rhamnose, Tocopherol, Phytosphingosine, Ceramide Np, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide Ap, Cholesterol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Fructooligosaccharides.

It contains salicylic acid but it’s in the middle of the ingredients list so it might’ve been a low amount. The box cautioned me to keep it away from my eyes, so that’s what I did. I applied it on my face but kept it far away from my eyes, when I washed my face I kept my eyes shut tight and didn’t get any soap in there. After 2 days my eyes felt really dry and uncomfortable. My vision’s fine but my eyes are still dry and I can’t make it moist no matter how much I blink and how much water I drink. I stopped using it yesterday but the dryness is still the same. If you did have dry eyes, how long did it take for you to recover and what did you do to alleviate it?\nEdit: if anyone wants to see the ingredients list to see what could be causing my dry eyes, here it is: \n\nWater, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Lauryl Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Citric Acid, Peg-60 Glyceryl Isostearate, Sodium Chloride, Glyceryl Stearate Se, Coco-Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Phytate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-7, 1,2-Hexanediol, Quillaja Saponaria Bark Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Ceramide Np, Ceramide Eop, Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide Ap, Centella Asiatica Extract, Niacinamide, Ceramide As, Panthenol, Ceramide Ns, Salicylic Acid, Arginine, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Tocopherol, Stearic Acid, Ascorbic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine",

The next day I received an email stating they’re in select Ulta stores. I purchased the Oil to Milk, the jelly cleanser, and the ceramide barrier serum. The oil to milk feels the best! It is the most hydrating and soothing cleanser, that doesn’t seem to leave my skin feeling stripped. (Second favorite has been Avene tolerance gentle cleansing lotion). Even cleansers labeled as gentle, or non soap, soapbark extract, etc. all seemed to irritate my skin or left my skin feeling raw or stripped. The other Cocokind products I bought are okay, but I really hope this oil to milk works well for me! Has anyone else tried it or had success with oil cleansers?",

I’ve been waking up with little whiteheads every day for months and the 2 days I used the dermalogica cleanser I didn’t wake up with any new ones.\n\nOn Friday night I used Bioderma atoderm eye cream around my eyes and woke up Saturday morning and noticed darkness on the outer corner of my eye but I thought nothing of it. I had been using this product earlier this year for a few months and had no reaction to it but I hadn’t used it since then. So I used the dermalogica cleanser and eye cream again yesterday and after washing my face and applying the eye cream straight after I noticed my whole eye area was red and wrinkly. I immediately washed the cream off and last night I used my normal cleanser instead, avoiding my eye area but today I’ve woken up with both eyes swollen, red and itchy. \n\nI’m just wondering if anyone knows what one of these products could have caused this.
