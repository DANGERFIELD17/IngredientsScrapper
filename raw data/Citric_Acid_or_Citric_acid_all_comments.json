Plus the lemon is water based and it will dissolve/damage the paper over time.\n\nBut what about dissolving some pure cooking grade citric acid in some ethanol or isopropanol and putting it all in a new and never used highlighter pen container?\n\nI'm assuming it will do the job just fine, won't damage the paper and it will actually be practical and useful.

    "body": "For around $5 you can get a box of over 100 tablets that do an amazing job cleaning bacteria and hard water buildup inside your water bottles. Most branded bottle cleaners are relatively overpriced for the product and come with very few tablets.\n\nI use a straw brush to dip it into the bottle and scrub out the cap and drinking straw as well as around the lip of the bottle! I’ve never seen it so clean before and it’s relatively fast. I leave mine in for about 5-10 minutes before pouring and rinsing out.\n\nWarning: DO NOT GET THE FLAVORED ONES UNLESS YOU WANT EVERYTHING TO BE MINTY FRESH\n\nEDIT: Y'all are awesome. A bunch of people have asked about which tablet I used so I wanted to share: [Efferdent Complete Clean](https://www.amazon.com/Efferdent-Denture-Cleanser-Tablets-Complete/dp/B01498R95W/ref=asc_df_B01498R95W/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312163463904&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=10663298311797541151&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9013453&hvtargid=pla-583364560008&th=1) but any unflavored would work\n\nAlso we have seen a bunch of great alternative uses suggested and asked about!\n\n* cleaning your kettle/Keurig\n* retainers\n* toilets and other ceramic items\n* \"elaborate glass articles\"\n* humidifiers/misters/essential oil diffusers \n* vases\n* CPAP equipment\n* reusable straws\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPSA: u/SiphonTheFern pointed out that it's very important to rinse it completely multiple times. It's not great to ingest the cleaning compound! I just went back and rinsed mine a few more times juuuuust to be safe. Also was warned about some hard plastic bottles like soda stream bottles, the cleaning agents may be tough on them\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2: for those of you who keep commenting variations of \"why\", my water bottle has a bunch of stickers on it and I was looking for an alternative that minimized water on the outside. Also I can be very lazy...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 3: of course there are plenty of alternatives people have mentioned: vinegar, diluted bleach, small bump of oxyclean, dishwashing powder, citric acid! Love all the input everyone",

Never had them, just heard about them through the grapevine (had a Jewish vegan friend in elementary school and she would tell me about her family’s adventures in vegan Jewish cuisine) and became entranced. Printed out a recipe from the family PC and got to cooking. \n\nMy family tried the latkes. None of us had had latkes before. My mother, a genius cook, kindly suggested that perhaps I had made a mistake in the cooking process. Ended up I had accidentally used a powdered dried yogurt (called “kashk” in my parents’ language) instead of flour or something.\n\nI was distraught! My dad was a champ and ate the rest (and I’d made a whole bunch of latkes to celebrate finally getting to find out what a latke is).  To this day he claims they were delicious. It’s been 2 decades since the latke incident and my family STILL talks about it, in part because it wasn’t even my biggest cooking mishap lol.\n\nThe biggest mishap apparently was me subbing cinnamon for brown sugar in some cake recipe because to me they looked similar so they must function similarly, right? My mom says she realized my mistake and told me. I apparently told her it was she who was wrong and proceeded to eat the entire cake out of sheer spite. Again, I have no memory of this but knowing me, I believe my mom lol.\n\nAnyway, that’s all to say your post is so relatable, and I’m glad the bars turned out well!\n\nI do love to learn, and thankfully cooking and baking can often be a low stakes way to learn from mistakes, including finding new, off the beaten path ways to make stuff. \n\nAnd I have since made latkes somewhat properly and they were as awesome as I’d hoped they be!",

I've been updating [this blog post](https://www.culinarycrush.biz/all/the-types-of-acidity) with details I've learned since I posted this to reddit.\n\nChances are, you are already incorporating acidity into your cooking. But are you thoughtful about ***which*** ***type*** of acidity to use for a given dish? Because lemon doesn't work with everything.\n\nIn this post, I describe the different types of acidity and how you can incorporate each into your cooking.\n\n# What's acidity?\n\nTo chefs, acidity is control. When used judiciously, acidity can brighten a heavy or fatty dish, bring attention to subtler flavors in a dish, or add complexity. Acidity can also diminish the perception of sweetness and bitterness or decrease the salt required to balance your dish.\n\nWhen adding acids to a recipe, it’s helpful to think of acidity as not a flavor but a *category* of flavors. There are different *types* of acidity, and each type has its pros and cons. Knowing which type of acidity to reach for (or knowing when to combine types of acidity to make a dish more interesting) will make your dishes more cohesive and thoughtful.\n\nSo let’s walk through the types of acidity — what they are, what they’re good for, and where to find them.\n\n# Citric acid\n\nWhen most people think of acidity, they think of citric acid. That’s because citric acid is the primary acid in citrus fruits such as lemon, lime, grapefruit, orange, and yuzu.\n\nTo me, citric acid tastes like early morning sunshine. It’s bright, it’s assertive, and it can stand on its own. It is the most acidic (i.e. it is lowest on the pH scale) of the popular acids.\n\n***When to use citric acid***\n\nI prefer to use citric acid in dishes that I want to taste *fresh*. Think salads or white fish preparations. When sautéing vegetables, for example, you might find that your vegetables taste less vibrant after you’ve cooked them; a squeeze of lemon can revive those cooked vegetables — bringing out flavors that are more reminiscent of the vegetable in its raw form.\n\nCitric acid loses much of its characteristic tang with heat. You can use this to your advantage if hoping to subdue citric acid (e.g. cooking oranges with braised duck), or you can choose to add your citrus towards the end of the cooking process. The rinds of citrus tend to contain more citric acid, so don’t be afraid to zest.\n\n***Where to find citric acid***\n\nIn addition to buying citrus, you can also buy pure citric acid. This can be useful when you want to incorporate the effects of citric acid without the flavors (particularly the sweetness) that come along with citrus. I often use the powder in the *leche de tigre* for my ceviche when I want more control of the acid levels. This method enables me to marinate my raw seafood in a liquid like shrimp broth instead of using just citrus juice.\n\n# Lactic acid\n\nLactic acid is the primary flavor associated with lacto-fermentation. If you’ve tasted pickles, sauerkraut, kimchi, miso, or yoghurt, you’ve tasted lactic acid. Even sourdough bread’s acidity is due in part to lactic acid.\n\nI think of lactic acid like turning up the dimmer in your living room. It’s a softer, rounder glow than citric acid — almost milky. I typically associate lactic acid with a bit of funkiness too, partially because it is usually derived from the fermentation of some other ingredient.\n\n***When to use lactic acid***\n\nI use lactic acid in dishes that need an uplifting note that is not distracting. Earthy broths or sauces seasoned with lactic acid still feel earthy but nonetheless sip lighter.\n\nI often add brightness to vegetable dishes by seasoning the vegetable with its lacto-fermented self. For example, when making celery root puree, I find that adding lemon (i.e. citric acid) is too noticeable — it doesn’t belong! So I season my celery root puree with fermented celery root instead.\n\n***Where to find lactic acid***\n\nThe best way to find lactic acid is to ferment something! Lacto-fermentation is easy, and it enables you to add subtle funk to your dishes. I also like to preserve lemons in order to mellow out the citrus’s citric acid with some lactic acid.\n\nBut you don’t have to rely on fermentation to add lactic acid to your dishes. You can also buy powdered lactic acid and incorporate it as needed. For example, I have a stash of lactic acid powder that I add to my yeasted pizza dough recipe to simulate a bit of the sourness of sourdough bread.\n\n# Acetic acid\n\nAcetic acid is the acidity you associate with vinegar or kombucha. It’s also found in trace amounts in sourdough bread (alongside lactic acid) and wines (especially natty wine or those described as having “volatile acidity”). Acetic acid is usually produced when alcohol is fermented in the presence of oxygen.\n\nI think of acetic acid like shining a flashlight on the heavier elements of your dish. Thanks in part to its pungent smell, it sticks out a bit, never quite mingling with the other ingredients.\n\n***When to use acetic acid***\n\nThe beauty of acetic acid is the accessibility of vinegar varieties. From rice wine vinegar to balsamic and everything in between, it’s easy to find a vinegar that complements your salad or main course.\n\nMore so than other types of acidity, vinegar begs for fats to complement its sourness and tame its smell. Emulsions of vinegar and butter or olive oil serve this purpose well.\n\n***Where to find acetic acid***\n\nI don’t just buy vinegars. I make them, too. Homemade vinegars (especially those made from fruits and vegetables) can have a thicker mouthfeel and sweeter taste, making them more balanced and almost a sauce on their own. The Noma Guide to Fermentation is an incredible resource for making your own vinegar.\n\nWhen I’m not planning months ahead with a custom vinegar, I also like to flavor otherwise neutral vinegars (like white wine vinegar). For example, before making mushrooms, I might throw mushroom scraps in with the vinegar I plan to use the next day.\n\nMost often, I opt for an extremely strong vinegar called ättika. From Sweden, ättika vinegar is four times as strong as regular vinegar, so it works well when you want to adjust acidity without imparting other flavors. I have a little spray bottle with ättika vinegar that I use to spritz a dish when I realize that it wasn’t as acidic as I was hoping.\n\n# Malic acid\n\nMalic acid is the acidity in a green apple. It’s also the principle acid found in apricots, blackberries, blueberries, cherries, mirabelle plums, peaches, pears, and quince. A cheap cooking wine tastes like malic acid to me.\n\nI think of malic acid like sunshine through a stained-glass window. It’s subtler than citric acid in a way that I can only describe as warm.\n\n***When to use malic acid***\n\nI find that malic acid works well to bring life to meat-centric dishes — particularly pork. It mingles well with sweetness, too, making it great for desserts.\n\nI don’t use malic acid much on its own, but I do try to incorporate it into dishes that are already acidic to add more complexity. A sauce with multiple types of acidity can taste like a whole fruit basket! For example, I often add both white wine and vinegar to butter sauces (i.e. I mix malic acid with acetic acid). Fermenting blackberries, similarly, is a means to add lactic acid to malic-rich berries.\n\n***Where to find malic acid***\n\nI keep some reduced white wine handy to adjust the malic acidity in dishes. Otherwise, I keep powdered malic acid on hand to adjust the liquids I use in my ceviche.\n\n# Other acids\n\nThe four acids I’ve described only scratch the surface. But the other acids don’t have as many culinary uses.\n\nOxalic acid (found in wood sorrel, chives, and purslane) certainly comes in handy (and is reminiscent of acetic acid), but excessive consumption of oxalic acid can be toxic. Tartaric acid plays an important role in lowering the pH in wine production, and it’s mixed with baking soda to become baking powder. Meanwhile, ascorbic acid is common too — because it's vitamin C!\n\n# Conclusion\n\nHope this was helpful. And when life gives you lemons, be sure to think twice about whether that’s the acidity life really needs right now.\n\nEdit: A couple folks asked about the blog where I post similar thoughts on food.

Vinegar which is often promoted as a natural cleaning agent is acetic acid.\n\nYou can buy big bags of citric acid online or from hardware shops. Just mix with water and apply heat to speed up the reaction. You can tell it's working if you see bubbles (the CO2).\n\nAs an aside, acid rain is the same principle.

    "body": "I've amassed a bit of a vanilla bean paste (VBP) collection over the past couple years, and I thought it was high time I compared them all to see which one is really my favorite!\n\nFlavor is obviously the most important, but because most of them were made with Madagascar Bourbon vanilla beans, the flavor profiles were pretty similar for the most part. So I also considered texture, price, and packaging (because no one likes a crusty lid).\n\nHere are my rankings:\n\n1. **Rising Star Baking Supply**. Excellent flavor with vanilla bean seeds *and* ground vanilla bean pods for extra-visible speckles. It has a squeezable bottle with a cap that has yet to go crusty thanks to the agave, a very good texture, and is $1.71/oz at Costco. (I think this is the organic brand/version of non-organic Magnolia Star vanilla bean paste, which is sold nationwide at Sam's Club for a little cheaper, but I don't have one near me to confirm.)\n2. **Nielsen-Massey**. Very good flavor and very good texture. This had a more prominent oaky flavor (which you usually get with Madagascar beans) than the others, which was nice. I got a big 10-oz bottle at Costco for $1.99/oz that's plastic, but the small 4-oz jars are glass.\n3. **LorAnn** (tied for second). Very good flavor and very good texture. The shape and size of the bottle is nice for pouring out little measured dollops for drinks. It used to be the $2.50/oz organic version at TJ's before they dropped it last year, but now you have to buy it through LorAnn directly at $5.25/oz.\n4. **Simply Organic**. Very good flavor and good texture. It's made with invert sugar so it doesn't crystallize around the lid (or at least, hasn't yet for me). I like that the glass jar has a wide mouth so you can scoop in with big spoons rather than having to pour out. $5.80/oz\n5. **Rodelle** (tied for third). Very good flavor, good texture, and sold in a glass jar. There was quite a bit of crystallization on the lid after a week, but that's a small complaint. About $4.85/oz for a 2-oz jar.\n6. **Trader Joe's**. This one is okay. It's the cheapest of them all at $1.25/oz, which is practically unheard of, but it doesn't have a super strong vanilla flavor. It's also really runny compared to every other VBP on the market, which I don't like. I usually pair it with vanilla extract so I get the speckles and the vanilla punch I'm looking for. It's not bad if you're on a budget, but it's not my favorite.\n7. **McCormick**. I **do not** recommend. The squeezable tube is nice, but it has citric acid, which makes the flavor all wrong for unbaked goods! I didn't notice it in baked goods, but the sour taste is very prominent in unbaked goods like buttercream, which gives the whole batch an artificial \"birthday cake\" flavor—without it actually being artificial?? It's also made with glucose syrup derived from wheat, and while the National Celiac Association says that's safe for gluten-free people, I'm personally not risking a bake with it for my friends with celiac. $6.05/oz\n\nI have even more pictures and 2500 more words on the subject [here](https://floralapron.com/blog/best-vanilla-bean-pastes/), but this is the short version. Hope it's helpful! :)",

    "body": "Naisipan kong dumaan sa Watsons ngayong araw para bumili ng lotion, dahil paubos na yung ginagamit ko. Nakita ko tong lotion na 'to ng Luxe Organix na naka B1T1 for Php 405, kaya naisipan kong subukan. 2 variant yung binili ko, itong Retinol + Gluta, tsaka yung Niacinamide + Arbutin. \n\nTLDR:\n\nMay microfoaming, malakas ang fragrance, heavier skin feel kumpara sa ibang serum lotions sa Market, mali-mali ang IL, mislabeled dahil imbes na retinol, Retinyl Palmitate ang laman base sa IL. \n\nUnahin muna nating tingnan ang packaging. Sa unang tingin, di nalalayo material sa packaging ng mga serum lotion ng Vaseline. Tho, yung sa Vaseline, rounded yung tabas ng seal ng tube sa both sides, samantalang itong sa LO ay pointed. \n\nSa itsura naman mismo ng laman, off-white na medyo madilaw yung kulay ng lotion. Medyo clumpy din yung itsura pagkalabas nito sa tube, at madali ding mag-break yung emulsion upon skin contact. Malakas yung fragrance nya na dominated ng floral notes. Unang naisip ko nga nung naamoy ko e amoy poon, dahil sa sobrang floral. \n\nMedyo matagal ipahid sa balat, kumpara sa ibang serum lotion na nasubukan ko na. Naka-observe din ako ng microfoaming during application nitong lotion. Ang microfoaming ito yung nagkakaroon ng puti-puting streaks sa balat habang pinapahid ang isang product, kadalasan mga emulsion gaya ng lotion at creams. Ang microfoaming ay dulot ng pagkaka-trap ng air sa product habang ipinapahid sa balat. Kung ikukumpara ko ito sa ibang serum lotion na nagamit ko na (Vaseline Gluta-Hya Serum Burst Lotion, Smoochkins Nia-Arbutin Nano White Serum Lotion), ito yung pinaka heavy ang skin feel. Hindi ko masyadong na-feel yung pagka serum lotion. And lastly naka-experience din ako ng pamumula at pantal sa braso ko after ko gamitin itong lotion na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list. \n\nWater (Aqua), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Myristate, Fragrance, C15-19 Alkane, Stearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Triethanolamine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Glutathione, Polysorbate 20, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ceramide NP, Mannitol, Pentylene Glycol, CI19140, Phosphatidylcholine, Retinyl Palmitate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Polyglyceryl-10,  Citric Acid, Tocopherol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nHindi na talaga nawala ang mga errors sa IL ng mga local products. Di yata talaga uso ipa-check man lang sa regulatory personnel ang IL na ilalagay sa final layout ng packaging bago ang ipa-mass printing. Para sa product na ito, hindi Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol ang tamang INCI name, kung hindi Cetearyl Alcohol. Next, Polyglyceryl-10, what? Incomplete yung ingredient name. Ang daming Polyglyceryl-10 esters na nag eexist, wag nyo na kami paghulain. (Side Note: Ang Polyglyceryl-10 esters ay kadalasang ginagamit as non-ionic emulsifier sa cosmetics.). \n\nPangalawa kong napansin, CI19140. Ang CI19140 ay isang dye na kilala din bilang Tartrazine Yellow or FD&C Yellow #5. Ito yung nagbigay ng medyo madilaw na kulay sa lotion na ito. Konektado ito sa kasunod kong punto. \n\nIkatlo, bakit Retinyl Palmitate ang nakalista dito sa IL? Kaya nyo ba nilagyan ng Yellow #5 ang lotion na ito para magmukhang may retinol, kasi nakakapagdulot ng paninilaw sa mga product ang retinol kapag ihinalo ito? Ngayon, ano ba ang problema kung retinyl palmitate ang nakalagay, imbes na retinol? Ito kasi yun: maliban sa obvious na mislabelling sa product na ito, mas mababa ang potency ng retinyl palmitate kaysa sa retinol. Sa buong retinoid family, ang mga retinyl esters kagaya ng retinyl palmitate ang may pinakamababang potency, dahil kailangan pa nito ng isang extra conversion step (retinyl palmitate -> retinol). Tandaan, ang mga retinoids, kailangang ma-convert into retinoic acid para ma-activate ang retinoic acid receptors natin sa balat at makuha ang benefits. \n\nRetinyl esters -> Retinol -> Retinaldehyde -> Retinoic Acid\n\nKada conversion step, bumababa ang potency ng isang retinoid, kaya sa kaso ng retinyl palmitate, na isang retinyl ester, eto ang may pinakamababang potency. \n\nMay peptides din pala itong lotion na ito: Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9 at Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11.\n\nAng acetyl tetrapeptide-9 ay isang signaling peptide na nagbibigay ng message sa fibroblasts sa ating dermis na magproduce ng collagen (specifically Collagen Type 1) at proteoglycans, na mahalaga para mapanatili ang structure at mapanatiling tight (hindi sagging) ang balat natin.  Nakakatulong din itong mabawasan ang appearance ng fine lines sa mukha, dahil na rin sa stimulation ng collagen at proteoglycan production. \n\nKung ang dermis ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, ang epidermis naman ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-11. Kagaya ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, signaling peptide din ito na nagbibigay ng mensahe sa epidermis na mag-synthesize o magproduce ng Syndecan-1 at Collagen XVII. Kapag mataas ang dalawang ito sa balat, nag-iimprove ang elasticity ng balat. \n\nKaramihan ng mga nabanggit na benepisyo ng dalawang peptides na ito ay base pa lamang sa mga in-vitro studies na naisagawa na. Wala pang gaanong in-vivo clinical studies na lumabas kaya medyo skeptical pa din ako sa mga peptides na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo lastly sa product claims. \n\n* Retinol + Gluta\n\n* Whitening Serum Lotion\n\n* Lightening\n\n* Firming\n\n* Hydrating\n\n* 24 hr Supple Smooth\n\n* 3X Peptide Youth Repair + Hyaluronic Bright + Ceramide Glow\n\nUnang claim pa lang, sablay na. Wala namang retinol tong lotion na 'to. Pinaglololoko ako nitong LO e. \n\nSa claim na lightening at whitening, medyo duda ako. Mukhang glutathione lang ang pwedeng masabi ng brand na ito na skin lightening ingredient. Pero duda ako sa efficacy ng glutathione na makapagpa lighten ng skin topically. Maraming limitations yung mga published studies tungkol sa efficacy ng topically applied gluta, gaya ng mababang bilang ng participants sa studies at sobrang iksi na study period. \n\nSa claim na firming, mukhang inilagay ito gawa nung mga peptides. Sa hydrating claim, meron namang hydrating ingredients (glycerin, hyaluronic acid derivatives, olive oil, Plukenetia Volubilis oil, tsaka Ceramide NP). Same din dun sa mga sumunod na claims, dahil sa presence ng mga nabanggit na ingredients. \n\n\nFinal words:\n\nHindi ako masaya sa nabili kong lotion na 'to. Hindi kasing lightweight at fast absorbing nung iba kong nasubukan na serum lotions. Amoy poon yung fragrance. May microfoaming during application. Nagkapantal ako sa braso. Mali-mali ang IL. Pero yung pinaka disappointing sa lotion na 'to e yung claim na may retinol daw, pero retinyl palmitate lang ang nasa ingredient list. May paglalagay pa ng yellow dye para magmukhang may retinol. Napakalaking red flag para sa akin ang pagmi-mislabel ng product.\n\nAyun lang. Salamat sa pagbabasa. At laging maging mapanuri sa mga binibili at balak nating gamitin na products. \n\n",

Yellow dye appears to have been added to the lotion to give the appearance of fully evolved retinol being an ingredient as retinol usually makes creams look yellow.\n* The peptides used claim to target fine lines and elasticity, but only proven by in-vitro studies (i.e. in controlled lab environments) vs. in-vivo (i.e. on living organisms)\n\nThank you for this in-depth review, skincare\\_chemist19!

        "body": "Professor Ian Rae:\n\n> They identified two mixtures - of 8 and 15 constituents, respectively - that did correlate with slight effects. Only one of the mixtures included the kind of 'chemical suspects' that one expects to find in such studies, the two synthetic sweeteners, aspartame and sucralose. The associations between the mixtures and the condition were very weak, and similar mixtures that included many of the same constituents showed no association. Of course, association does not equal causation. The researchers mention this, but you have to read a long way into the paper to find it. It's not mentioned in the abstract and the title of the paper includes only the merest hint of association, let alone causation.\n\n> Although it has involved a lot of work - not just by the 23 authors of this paper, but by the 100,000 people who were surveyed - the results are weak. I wondered why this was ever published. The answer may have something to do with 'publish-or-perish' or the journals' approach to 'put the work out there' and let the scientific community decide on its validity. This can lead to sensationalism, but I don't think it will in this case because it's not sensational enough.\"\n\nEmeritus Professor Jennie Brand-Miller:\n\n> Both mechanisms would therefore be expected to REDUCE the risk of type 2 diabetes, not increase it. I suspect these findings are simply chance findings because the researchers were ‘fishing’ and looked at so many food additives. \n\nDr Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz:\n\n> It's also unclear what meaning these results have. The biggest risk increase in the study was seen for Mixture 5, which contained 14 different food additives including citric acid and paprika extract. But due to the complex methodology the authors used to create these mixtures, it’s not clear how you could implement these findings in your daily life. The closest the authors come is saying that it might be a good idea to reduce your soft drink intake, but we didn’t really need this study to know that. It’s an interesting piece of research, but it’s hard to see how the results could be used outside of a strictly research setting.\"\n\nDr Evangeline Mantzioris:\n\n> However, it must be remembered that this is an observational study and not an experimental study, and hence a cause-and-effect relationship cannot be drawn from it. Additionally, the intake of food additives in the diet of the participants could not be verified by any blood or urine tests.\n\n> There is a growing evidence base of the impact of UPF [ultra-processed foods] on both physical, cognitive and mental health. As well as containing low levels of nutrients, high levels of saturated and trans fats, sugar and salt, UPF also contain food additives to improve taste and shelf life of foods. This study adds to this evidence base of the health risks associated with a high intake of UPFs.\"",

In this comment, for those interested, here’s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: \n\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004570\n\nFrom the linked article: \n\nTwo mixtures of common food additives, including aspartame, sucralose, xanthan and guar gums, modified starches, carrageenan and citric acid, could be linked with a slightly increased risk of type 2 diabetes, according to international researchers. The team looked at a French cohort of 108,643 people and found two of five frequently consumed food additive mixtures were linked with type 2 diabetes. The first mixture is mostly found in a variety of industrially-processed foods such as broth, dairy desserts, fats, and sauces and the second mixture is often found in artificially sweetened beverages and sugary drinks. Below, Aussie experts say the observational nature of the study could make it difficult to draw conclusions that are applicable to daily life, but many add that trying to eat less ultra-processed foods is never a bad idea regardless.",

Instead, I think it's a solvent mixing phenomenon as others have suggested, but made more readily observable since the liquid the particles are dispersed in (propylene glycol and glycerine confirmed by OP) are quite viscous which, among other possible effects, will slow the process of mixing down.\n\n-----------------------\n\n\nFrom a quick search, it looks like titanium dioxide goes from about it's isoelectric point at neutral pH to high positive zeta potential at lower pH. That is to say, it goes from a neutral \"surface\" charge which tends to clump particles together to a positive \"surface\" charge which would cause particles to repel each other and disperse quickly into solution. Alternatively, the pH change could change how any stabilisers are interacting with the particles.\n\nNot saying it's the case, but it might be a feasible alternative to a chemical reaction.",

    "body": "Context: I have a citrus allergy, and because it's a weird thing to be allergic to, I always explain it as best as I can when I'm ordering food (it's not just citrus fruits, it's the actual citric acid). \n\nThis happened a few years ago, I was on a school trip, and one night we had dinner at a local pub. When it was my turn to order, I did my usual speech of what I'm allergic to, and the waitress took it all down. \nI get my food (a chicken and bacon burger), but it has this white sauce all over it and the side of chips. Since I don't really want to die, I ask my friend to taste it first, and she says it tastes very tangy and it probably has lemon. Ok, pain in the ass, but it's still early, I can get a new one made. \n\nI take it back over to the counter and tell the waitress what's wrong. She apologises a lot, and goes get the chef. \n\nChef: \"what's wrong with the food\"\n\nMe: \"I'm allergic to citrus, and I don't think I can eat this\"\n\nChef: \"there's nothin' in it\"\n\nMe: (taking no risks, and I'm surprised how confident my 15 year old self was) \"can you please list the ingredients in the sauce please\"\n\nChef: *sigh* \"fine ... Eggs, garlic, lemon...\"\n\nMe: \"lemon is citrus\"\n\nChef: ....\n\nMe: \"I can't eat this, I'll be sick\"\n\nChef: \"are you sure?\"\n\nMe: \"....yes...lemon is citrus...I'm allergic\"\n\nHe takes back my food, and remakes it with tomato sauce, like he should have done in the first place. That is the story of how I had to explain to a qualified head chef that lemon is citrus.\n\n\nTL;DR even though I explain my allergy before ordering food, I still get given something with lemon in it. I take it back and have to explain to the chef that lemon is citrus\n\nEdit: formatting\n\nEdit again: Technically, I do have an intolerance not an allergy. I call it an allergy when ordering food because people don't seem to take intolerances seriously, but I really don't want to be blind, lose my speech, have the whole right side of my body go numb, have a headache so bad it makes me cry, and be vomiting for up to 3 days.

I hesitate to call it an allergy, as it isn't life threatening, so by using Vegan, I hope to at least get something that's safe.

I don't want to be one of them who causes servers to roll eyes and proclaim it's a \"lifestyle\" choice. My choice is to not have the squits for hours, and feel so sick that I can't move from the bathroom for fear of throwing up. For several hours. \n\nWhat really gripes me is the allergen list. Places usually have a book that lists allergens, but some staff don't want to give it to me to check. I did costa a few weeks ago, and asked to see it. I got \"What are you wanting to check?\" I asked to see the book, and had that answer a few times. \"It's complicated!

Also it wasn't complicated, it was very easy to read thanks. Eventually I got to look at it, to find 2 items designated as Vegan, and neither in stock. I originally asked if their V marks on the item labels meant vegetarian, or vegan. I was assured vegan, till I pointed it out to them that in the book it's vegetarian.\n\nMy favourite ones are \"We can use yoghurt in that?\" and \"what about this butter replacement margarine? It only has buttermilk in it\"",

I know friands are gluten free because they’re not made with flour, they use almond meal - there’s no reason for them to contain any gluten. The cafe also previously stated that they were gluten free. Well, I get half way through my friand and, out of interest, ask the waitress what their (other) gluten free options are. She lists one item. Banana bread (which is pretty ridiculous anyway because they should have a much bigger range.) I ask, “What about the friands?” “Oh, no. They have flour in them.” I don’t react immediately when I do have gluten, so I don’t know yet whether the waitress was dumb as dog shit and didn’t know what is in them, or whether I’m going to paint the toilet. \n\nAlso, in the same order, they messed up my plain chocolate frappe size (it was a small instead of a regular) so I took it back, it comes back out more like a milkshake than a frappe. It’s like they just put it in the bigger cup, chucked some milk and chocolate in and gave it a stir. \n\nI left a bad review on their Facebook page.",

    "body": "This a warning/vent about remembering what interacts with your meds.  \nAbout a month or so ago, I realized that one of my biggest struggles I was facing was I was dehydrated ALL THE TIME, and the combo of my meds (Concerta for ADHD, Wellbutrin and Zoloft for anxiety/depression) was aggravating this problem. While the easy solution would be \"just drink more water\",  I'm a bit weird in the fact that I don't like water -- I think most the time it tastes funny, and it MUST be cold and filtered if I want to drink it at all.  \nEnter Liquid IV - tastes yummy (especially the Firecracker flavor), helps me stay hydrated, and at the beginning, it was making a big difference. I felt more focused, engaged, and was getting stuff done at work.\n\nUntil about two weeks ago, when suddenly I've been struggling to even get one work thing done a day (I work from home, admin stuff, and I'm currently in the process of updating a ton of policies). Not even my pomodoro and zone out music was doing the trick -- it felt like the meds had just STOPPED working entirely and I was back to square one.  \nTalking about it with my partner today, I mentioned I was struggling to focus, when he looked at me and asked \"is there anything else that might be interacting with the meds? I know you don't drink coffee after you take them, but maybe the Iiquid IV has something acidic?\" and then it hit me like lightening.\n\nI switched to taking my Liquid IV water bottle in the morning instead of the afternoon, right after I took my meds, not realizing that the #2 ingredient in Liquid IV is citric acid. I already avoided coffee or caffeine right after taking meds for at least 30 minutes, cause I know that can affect the absorbency, but totally put together realize that citric acid does *the same damn thing,* if not more so.\n\nSo long story short, Liquid IV will become a late afternoon treat, and I'll go a few days without it so the meds will maybe start being effective again. I feel pretty stupid, so I figured I'd share my story in case anyone else is struggling with something similar.\n\n  \nEdit: holy Dina I leave Reddit for a day and come back to this post going a little wild 🤣 I didn't have any Liquid IV this morning and I definitely feel like my meds are working better! \n\nCouple of things to highlight:\n\n1. I'm not a doc -- this is just my experience. Talk to your doc or someone knowledgable about interactions for your specific meds. \n\n2. I'm on slow release Concerta! For people wondering \n\n3. I'm so glad I'm not the only one who doesn't like regular water 🤣\n\n4. I still recommend liquid IV cause it WAS helping before I took it too close to my meds BUT YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE MORE THAN ONE LIQUID IV A DAY. It can be dangerous and you can get too much of certain vitamins that will really mess with your system \n\nThanks to everyone who commented or comisterated, and I hope my experience helps some of you figure out why your meds aren't working as well!

Citric acid increase the breakdown of many meds but adderall and prob other stimulants are very affected by it.\n\nThe citric acid would be out of your stomach and small intestine that day which is where the issue occurs.\n\nI push electrolytes all the time, especially since you said “just drink more water.” If you’re thirsty after a bottle (mine is 40 oz) or two (now I’m talking 16 oz), then you prob need electrolytes. \n\nThe cheapest, easiest, most customizable way to add them is lite salt or salt + sodium free salt. \n\nI just hate how ppl are getting practically scammed with Liquid IV and LMNT and stuff. I would need like 2-3 per day (according to directions). I’m not paying $90/mo on something that I can buy for $3 that’s customizable and lasts over a year.\n\nFor OP specifically, since you say you like cold, maybe try some smashed mint or mint tea (just reuse the tea bag until it has no flavor or feels like you shouldn’t). \n\nIf you’re thinking ahead, you can cold steep most herbal teas for water flavor. If you’re not thinking ahead, then hot brew several bags and add a lot of ice and some cold water until it’s good. \n\nAnd imo honey. Always honey.\n\nAnyway, the actual point was for optimum effectiveness Adderall ppl for sure (I didn’t research the others as much) should avoid acidic foods and high fat foods at the same time as their meds, add in more protein and magnesium and do *your best* flesh suit maintenance. \n\nThough I have read here that some people here and in the meme sub have had a couple opposite experiences.",

    "body": "Citric acid comes as a powder, doesn't stink and is imho better and more convenient than both Vinegar and Baking Soda around the house. Some ways I use it:\n\n* Descaling the kettle - fill kettle with water, boil, add as much citric acid as you like, watch the scale dissolve. Super effective and doesn't stink out out the whole house. Bonus you now have hot citric acid for descaling whatever else you have - shower heads, shower tiles, toilets, the espresso machine, whatever you like.\n* Improving hard water in appliances - I've seen tips about putting a bowl of vinegar in the bottom of the dishwasher to reduce white residue for hard water. What a pain in the butt. My dishwasher is already full thanks. Just add some citric acid to the same place you add the wash powder. Problem solved. I also use it in the washing machine to help the same way.\n* Hot citric acid will dissolve brown urine stains in the toilet. Make a batch while descaling the kettle or in a pan, use the plunger to push the water out of the toilet bowl and pour in the hot citric acid. Give it a scrub to get the easy stuff and leave it to dissolve the hard stains. Come back and give it another scrub and flush later. Your toilet bowl is now back to pristine whiteness.\n* Pour a bunch of the powder into the bottom of the kitchen garbage can. No matter how much liquid ick leaks out of the bags it will never mold or odor again. Plus once it's dampened and dried out it becomes solid and will just sit there being awesome for years.\n* Scrubbing the stove. It's a mildly abrasive powder, just like baking soda only acidic instead of alkaline. Add a little water to make an abrasive paste. If the dried on food matter still won't budge you can add some baking soda to make a fizzy abrasive powder that can lift up the matter.\n* It may also be a decent replacement for CLR especially when hot but I have only tried it on calcium and limescale, not rust (CL but not R in CLR) but it might work.\n* BONUS - Kids baking soda volcano and/or bath balls - premix baking soda powder and citric acid powder, add water to activate volcano. Add scented oil and press into ball for bath ball.\n\nI'm sure there are many more uses, not even including the food preservation related uses it has.",

Chewing increases saliva flow, and reduces xerostomia (dry mouth), also works with gum. \n\nDry mouth is bad for teeth, which is a side effect of adhd meds and also meds such as BP  and anxiety meds. Lots of people on bp meds find themselves with suddenly worsening teeth and more tooth decay, not realizing its relates to your meds.\n\nAnd I know yall aren't brushing your teeth. (Cuz I don't either sometimes)\n\nP.s. also, acids are bad. Enamel starts to erode at pH 5.5. People who drink alot of water with enhancers find themselves with more decay, not realizing the citric acid in it means you cant just treat it like water. Another reason to stay away from soda/spicy drinks.\n\nEdit: this doesnt mean you should cancel your dentist appointment, its just a small helpful tip from your future dentist. should mention that chewing gum might not be the best option for those with tmj issues, depends on severity\n\nEdit 2: didn't expect this much attention.

I randomly tried a fairly standard recipe this week but it also included 1/4 teaspoon citric acid or vinegar. I'd never seen these things in a recipe so I tried the vinegar. \nIt is the softest damn crust. It comes out \"knock-knockable\" like all bread, but within an hour, the outer section tastes just like the store. The kids ate an entire loaf in a day. It's also really cheap because it's flour, honey, butter and yeast. No milk or eggs. I got 25 lbs of flour at Sam's for $12 so I'm not gonna do the math, but im guessing I'm making this loaf for 50 cents. Who knew a tiny bit of vinegar could do such a thing?\nEdit: What kind of dumbass forgets to share the recipe?\nSecond edit: my bread was already 200 degrees at 30 minutes so I didn't bake it the full 45.\n\nhttps://www.theflavorbender.com/homemade-white-bread-recipe/",

His hot sauce was promptly confiscated and markus was reassigned to assist in my department where we find that several other poisonous substances are used by humans to enhance their foods, like citric acid which has enough toxicity to maelt through most species' skin.\n\nTruly the dominant species of earth is equally as fascinating as they are weird.",

You are fortunate that xheir species is compatible with rapid organ regrow techniques. \n\nMarkus: That’s horrible!…but I didn’t serve anything like that! What the heck is Bromelain anyway?\n\nYorik checked his notes, he had read the phrase multiple times in preparation for the meeting and it still turned 3 of his stomachs.\n\nYorik: I believe you served it on a small wooden spear accompanied with a cube of… a cube of coagulated bovine lactate?\n\nYorik: The… I believe you called it “Cheese and Pineapple sticks”\n\nMarkus:…pineapple… yeah…ok… ummm that’s on me, even humans know that’s the fruit that eats you back. I should have thought that through.\n\nYorik:… The fruit that…you knowingly eat… that’s… I… why?… WHY ARE HUMANS LIKE THIS?\n\nMarkus: It’s not a party without beer and nibbles.",

    "body": "This happened yesterday, but today I’ve finally convinced myself that my pets are all fine.\n\nYesterday, I looked at my aquarium and panicked. The snails had climbed out of the water. The fish were at the surface gasping. The shrimp were on their sides, motionless, with their legs in the air. I’ve had one of those shrimp for eight years. I bought her when I was at university. We’ve been through a lot together, and I built the entire ecosystem for her. Shrimp *never* sit completely still, unless they are dead.\n\nThe carbon dioxide system (for the plants) had gone into overdrive and gassed all of my pets. \n\nThe carbon dioxide is produced through citric acid reacting with baking soda. The two are kept in separate bottles, connected via tubing. As the carbon dioxide is released into the aquarium, the pressure in the baking soda bottle drops. This draws citric acid through into the bottle, creating more carbon dioxide. I control the release of the carbon dioxide using a valve.\n\nTwo days ago, the citric acid had almost run out and there was very little carbon dioxide being produced. I opened the valve, saw that it made little difference, opened it all the way and then forgot about it. Yesterday was much warmer than the day before. Somehow, this combined with the valve being open, caused all of the remaining citric acid to get dumped into the baking soda bottle at once. This produced huge amounts of carbon dioxide, which had been released into my aquarium over an hour or so.\n\nI panicked, flailed, and pulled myself together. I shut off the carbon dioxide release valve and turned on the air pump (which I usually run overnight to add oxygen to the tank when the plants are not photosynthesising). I changed half the water. I stared at the fish for a couple of minutes and saw that they were still at the surface, but that they were gasping less. I changed half the water again and dropped the temperature using ice. Cold water can hold a lot more oxygen than warm water.\n\nThe fish were the first to recover. They moved down into the tank and began looking for food. Then the snails climbed down. The smaller (male) shrimp started twitching feebly. The shrimp recovered painstakingly slowly. After an hour, the males righted themselves and began to slowly wonder round. Most of the larger females were up and moving after two hours. My favourite shrimp still had not moved. I was convinced that she was dead.\n\nAfter three hours she started moving feebly. At four hours she righted herself. It took her six hours to start moving round the tank. I was so relieved!\n\nThis morning, they all look fine. I fed the fish, and the shrimp all emerged from amongst the plants to steal the fish’s breakfast. All of them look ok.\n\nTL;DR: accidentally gassed all of my aquarium pets using carbon dioxide. Some of them really, really looked dead. After water changes and oxygen, have all turned out to be ok.",

Pretty much everyone who’s owned an axolotl has had to ‘tub’ them before for issues with them, the tank or anything but it doesn’t seem as common for fish and other aquarium critters. But by putting them into fresh dechlorinated water you’re essentially putting them into a 100% safe environment until your tank is safe again.

We looked at how cool the dry ice  melted in the aquarium all smoky and bubbling... few mins later all the fishes cane to the surface for air... ye don t play with dry ice",

That is to say, it goes from a neutral \"surface\" charge which tends to clump particles together to a positive \"surface\" charge which would cause particles to repel each other and disperse quickly into solution. Alternatively, the pH change could change how any stabilisers are interacting with the particles.\n\nNot saying it's the case, but it might be a feasible alternative to a chemical reaction.”\n\n- u/Aquapig",

Its breath was steaming out in front of it and it was hugging itself with its arms as it shivered. The temperature was below the freezing point for water and the Subject had been, well, subjected to the temperature and humidity for over two hours, its body temperature beginning to finally drop.\n\nThe Subject no longer kept moving, no longer used physical effort to keep up its internally generated body temperature.\n\nAs Loovuu watched, the Subject sat down. Its head rested on its folded arms that were on its knees. It went still\n\nMedical crews rushed in, wrapping it in warm cloths, working to bring up its body temperature.\n\nLoovuu turned off the video with a flute of disgust, then opened up another one.\n\nThis time the temperature was high. Over 322 Degrees True Measurement. The Subject had found a spot to sit down and was not moving. As Loovuu watched the sped up footage it eventually quit sweating liquid to cool itself through evaporation. It began to babble, then wander, then collapsed.\n\nAgain, medics rushed in.\n\nLoovuu closed the file and opened another. Air pressure tests. Another. Atmosphere gas mixture tests. Another. How long it could go without nourishment without ill effect. Another. How long it could go without sleep. Another. How long it could go without dihydrogen-monoxide.\n\nAll scientific experiments to test the Subjects endurance and the extremes it could survive and for how long.\n\nLoovuu gnashed his teeth, keeping his hard rubbery lips between his legs clamped shut even as he ground his flat herbivore teeth.\n\nHe looked up at Chief Scientific Senior Over Director Ullglugoo. \"This is monstrous.\"\n\nThe CSSOD fluttered their fronds in agreement.\n\n\"That psychopath UUnvuuloo approved of all of these,\" Loovuu stated, his fronds curled tightly in outrage. \"This is the kind of testing you would do on a lab animal in the ancient times. All of those could have been determined through biological scans at rest.\"\n\nLoovuu stood up from the stool and scuttled over to the window, looking out at the clear dry day. \"This is a Forerunner, not an animal, not a laboratory specimen. It is a member of an intelligent, star faring species who had mastered faster than light travel while our people were still running across the plains to avoid the great wild fires.\"\n\nUllglugoo fluttered his fronds again.\n\n\"We have methods that we can use that UUnvuuloo and his gaggle of now-obvious psychopaths would never use,\" Loovuu stated.\n\n\"It is arriving,\" Ullglugoo fluted.\n\nLoovuu moved over to another terminal, bringing it up.\n\nHe watched as the Forerunner snatched away the headsets, then broke the beam ray pistol.\n\n\"It instigated that response purposefully,\" Ullglugoo said.\n\n\"Yes, to see if it could trick its guards into deploying their weaponry then test how durable the weaponry is,\" Loovuu said. He grasped two hands together. \"It was judging whether its intellectual predictive model would work on our species.\"\n\n\"It appears to have,\" Ullglugoo agreed.\n\n\"That plotter UUnvuuloo and his pet psychopaths believe that the Forerunner does not possess enough neural tissue for advanced pattern recognition or action to action predictive analysis,\" Loovuu stated. \"Look how it deescalates the situation by looking out the window.\"\n\n\"Can it see through the fog?\" Ullglugoo asked.\n\nLoovuu nodded. \"I chose today to move it just because of the fog. A non-invasive examination of its optic systems showed what wavelengths and frequencies it could see. A rather wide band of the light spectrum, edging almost into the infrared and ultraviolet.\"\n\nUllglugoo nodded. \"So can it see through today's fog?\"\n\nLoovuu nodded. \"For us, the high moisture content causes light refraction among our visible light wavelengths. However, to the Forerunner, it can see enough other spectrums that are only mildly affected by the humidity, so while it might be a bit blurred at a distance, the technicians at Optical-Visual Sciences believe it can see, not only shapes, but nearly one hundred fifty million colors.\"\n\nUllglugoo made a staccato whistling sound of being impressed.\n\n\"By its vision, our rather unimpressively colored bodies would be full of swirls and patterns of vibrant, clashing colors,\" Loovuu said. The triggered another monitor and a Lurxu appeared, its body banded and swirled by colors that shimmered and sparkled among the gray, brown, yellow and blue that a Lurxu could normally see. It used glittering and sheen to differentiate.\n\n\"Of course, they see about a million times what we see,\" Loovuu said.\n\n\"We must look strange to their eyes,\" Ullglugoo said. He nodded at how the Forerunner sat quietly as the safety restrains, custom designed for it, were undone and the Forerunner was encouraged to leave the safety of the vehicle's passenger compartment. \"I too would be hesitant to trust such bizarrely colored creatures who are so different than me.\"\n\n\"No fronds, although the hair does suggest a slight parrallel evolution there. Only two eyes, but look at how close they are, that's binocular vision for depth perception we require three eyes and our fronds for,\" Loovuu stated. He gave a fluting sigh. \"She, and it is female, by the way, she is a remarkable specimen of planetary evolution.\"\n\n\"It... she, reminds me of a dual handed plains-spear. Deadly and efficient, to be respected,\" Ullglugoo said. \"She's beautiful.\"\n\n\"Yes. She is.\"\n\n\\-----\n\nUUnvuuloo stared at the video sent to him by those unevolved cretins from the Office of Scientific Inquiry, grinding his teeth in a steady monotonous sound that did nothing to reduce his anger.\n\nNo scientific method was being used in the video he was watching. It learned nothing about the Subject. It asked no questions, searched for no answers.\n\nIn the video the Subject was taken from a transport, where it had been manacled to the wall and put on a hard plank of plasteel to act as a seat that would have left a Lurxu in agony for days. The subject moved into the blank gray fog of high humidity. It looked around slowly and the guards, none of them wearing headpieces for communication, all of them holding beam projectors, waited for it to stop looking around.\n\nOnce it had looked around, the one holding the stingbeam moved in front, making a follow motion with its rear two hands.\n\nThe Subject followed and the quartet moved through the fog.\n\nTwice the guards moved far enough away from the Subject that the camera lost sight of them, only computer assistance and thermal imaging allowed the camera to show where the three Lurxu were.\n\nThe Subject followed easily, even when directional shifts were made by one or the other Lurxu motioning with the hands nearest the Subject.\n\nThe Subject showed a faint flicker of emotion, a quirking of the corners of its lips, a pinching of the nostrils, the fourth time the directions were changed.\n\nAccording to the minimap in the upper right, they were just leading the Subject around cars in the parking lot in a wandering pattern.\n\nWhat did that prove? That it could possibly see in the fog? That the corrosive dihydrogen-monoxide factory pollution did not bother the subject even when subjected to 70% humidity?\n\nHis office had proven that.\n\nFinally, the group reached the door. The keypad was punched in and the Lurxu in the lead pulled on the lever.\n\nIt didn't move.\n\nThe Lurxu fluted annoyance and tried again. It put effort into it. It hung off the lever, making fluting noises of anger.\n\nThe Subject reached forward, grabbed the end of the lever, and slowly applied its strength.\n\nOn the side, the force measurement rapidly moved up.\n\nUUnvuuloo stared at the numbers. The subject was putting more force on the handle than a Lurxu weighed, with one hand and leaning forward slightly off balance.\n\nThe lever finally moved with a loud crack. A tiny air cylinder blew rust out. The Subject looked at the grayish rust powder on its finger and shook its head before wiping the rust off on its pant leg.\n\nThe lights inside were dim. The Subject was led down the hallways and UUnvuuloo wondered if the Office of Scientific Inquiry was going to put it in a proper holding pen. Tests had determined that four featureless walls, a featureless floor, and a smooth ceiling, three times as high as an average Lurxu, would be perfectly acceptable quarters for the Specimen.\n\nInstead, there was strange furniture. There was several macroplas windows that showed either outside the building or recordings of nature. The guards moved over, opening drawers, showing clothing, towels, sheets, blankets. They showed the Subject the latrine facilities, the water shower, then left, making a show of locking the door.\n\nThe video cut off.\n\nUUnvuuloo  shook his head.\n\nNothing scientific about anything those heavy handed clumsy brutes were doing. There was no laboratory controls, no scientific method, no carefully metered and measured environment.\n\nHe wondered just what those morons who worked for the Martial Department thought they could learn.\n\n\\-----\n\nLoovuu watched the monitor, Chief Scientific Senior Over Director Ullglugoo and several members of the Dominion High Senate next to him.\n\nThe Forerunner, one \"Kar-tawr\", was sitting in the strange S-like chair. On the table in front of 'her' was a glass full of dihydrogen-monixide mixed with citric acid and fructose, full of frozen dihydrogen-monoxide.\n\n\"So, she needs the liquid to maintain bodily functions?\" one of the Senators asked.\n\n\"The Dominion Intelligence Services Research Projects determined that,\" Loovuu said. \"The additives actually are needed to maintain bodily function.\"\n\n\"Very acidic,\" another Senator said, shaking its fronds.\n\n\"It has some strange needs,\" Loovuu said. \"We noticed that exposure to ultraviolet wavelengths cause it to produce a needed substance. The substance is produced endogenously when ultraviolet wavelengths touch exposed the skin and trigger vitamin D synthesis within her body.\"\n\n\"Strange,\" the Senator said.\n\n\"We believe it evolved under a stellar mass that produced significant UV and IR radiation that was allowed through the atmosphere,\" CSSOD Ullglugoo said. \"We posit a high axial tilt producing highly energetic and variable weather changes.\"\n\n\"Even curioser,\" the other Senator said.\n\n\"It enjoys walking around in precipitation, high winds, and other weather phenomenon,\" Ullglugoo stated. \"We determined that the way it tilted its head to raise its face to precipitation was an act of pleasure.\"\n\n\"It does not seem well designed for defense,\" another Senator stated. \"Its epidermis looks soft, unlike our complex polymer epidermis of cellulose and lignin.\"\n\nUllglugoo shook his fronds. \"Do not be fooled, Senator. Its skeleton is a rigid combination of calcium phosphate loaded into a collagen framework with air spaces to increase strength while the collagen provides flexibility to the bone. It possess three dermal layers to our single layer. While its epidermis may be easily punctured or bruised, it heals much faster than our own.\"\n\nThe Senator nodded.\n\n\"That was determined by the DISRP, not by our tests,\" Loovuu said.\n\nThe Subject took a long drink from the glass, setting it down and looking back at the window, which showed the rippling waves of grass from one of the main plains.\n\n\"Did the DISRP measure its intellect?\" a Senator asked.\n\n\"It refused to cooperate,\" Loovuu stated. \"It uses passive resistance when at all possible. Often just falling limp to the floor,\" he rustled his fronds in humor. \"It weighs much more than it looks and its mass and body structural makeup make it very unwieldy to move.\"\n\n\"What do you determine its intelligence to be?\" the Senator asked, leaning forward. \"Huh, she is fastidious, wiping her mouth as well as the condensation from the table.\"\n\n\"High. Sentience and sapience are obvious in her movements and decisions,\" Ullglugoo stated. \"Observation has shown us much.\"\n\n\"Her repsonses are informative,\" Loovuu stated.\n\n\"I was told it was just repeating the same thing over and over,\" the First Senator said.\n\nLoovuu nodded. \"Yes. However, we of the Martial Department figured it out,\" the Senators all looked. \"She is a member of the Forerunner military, unsure as who has taken possession of her. She considers herself a prisoner and is only responding with the same information over and over.\"\n\n\"Which is?\" a Senator asked.\n\n\"We have determined that the first set of words is her name, with her last name first. Then her rank. Then her Social Identification Number or its equivalent, then her nation, then a declaration that she is a member of the military and then her branch of military,\" Loovuu said. \"Quite like what we teach our own soldiers to say in captivity.\"\n\nThe Senator nodded.\n\n\"We of the Defense Research Projects believe that she had been trained to repeat only that information even under torture or threat of death,\" Loovuu stated. \"As that is the only thing she utters, we believe the training was intense.\"\n\nThe Senators nodded.\n\n\"That is why we requested that she, the Subject, Kawtawr, be turned over to us,\" Loovuu said.\n\nThe Senators all nodded their fronds. One scurried back and turned to look at the other monitor.\n\nThe Forerunner was asleep, in a dimly lit room, a heavy blanket over her. She was tossing and turning in her sleep.\n\nLoovuu moved over next to the Senator.\n\n\"It appears, she endures periods of unconsciousness, where her brain processes a wide variety of information,\" Loovuu stated. He touched a blank screen and the data came up in grays and pale yellows. \"Right now she is some kind of unconscious state where her brain is processing audio, visual, and tactile sensations while she is engaged in decision processes.\"\n\n\"Weird,\" a Senator said.\n\n\"Without these periods of unconsciousness, she begins to suffer psychologically according to tests performed by the DISRP. She also suffers organ instability as well as digestive issues,\" Ullglugoo stated. \"A phasically sensitive scientist stated she is partially cognitively aware and experiencing a surreal type of virtually reality generated by her brain. This apparently processes unconscious and conscious neurological functions.\"\n\nUllglugoo leaned against the wall, pressing on it with two arms. \"Unlike our hibernation period, her brain is always functioning at what we would consider a high level.\"\n\n\"Hmm,\" the Senator fluted, fluttering their fronds. \"Wait, what was that?\"\n\nEveryone turned to the monitor to see the Forerunner sitting up in bed, covered in moisture. Her hands were shaking and she wiped her forehead with one cloth clad arm.\n\nLoovuu rewound the footage.\n\nThe Forerunner was sleeping, clenching and unclenching her hands. She suddenly lunged up, one hand held in front of her, a nearly closed fist held up. She made a yanking downward motion with her right hand, all as she lunged up.\n\n\"What was that?\" a Senator asked.\n\nLoovuu examined the biometrics. \"Spike in adrenaline, cortisol, anxiety. High brain activity. Long term memory shifts into active memory,\" he looked up. \"Her neural virtual reality must have been anxiety inducing.\"\n\nOne Senator moved over to another monitor while the others stared.\n\n\"You aren't going to do experiments upon it while it is still under anxiety?\" a Senator asked.\n\n\"Any results would be inconclusive as well as risk a violent self-defense response,\" Loovuu stated. \"The DISRP have already done it and she reacted violently.\"\n\nThat Senator nodded.\n\n\"What is this?\" a Senator asked, pointing at the 2.5D LCD screen.\n\n\"It's something interesting,\" Loovuu stated, moving over to it. \"The rescue emergency pod had, aboard it, a virtual intelligence assistant. The DISRP brought it online, but had severely limited its processing ability and spent more time keeping it dormant so they could go over the code. They would bring it online briefly, then shut it down and try to examine the coding.\"\n\n\"What is it doing now?\" the Senator asked, tapping the screen.\n\n\"That's a touch sensitive screen, Senator,\" Loovuu said. He moved over. \"The Virtual Intelligence is still in the possession of the DISRP but, for reasons unknown it has recently begun communicating with me despite the DISRP has possession of it.\"\n\n\"And it is using this screen?\" the Senator asked.\n\nLoovuu nodded. \"It appears that its core coding has migrated to our own servers and merely communicates with the DISRP through several relays. It was on multiple monitors but I made sure that it would only use this touch screen.\"\n\n\"How?\" The Senator asked, looking at the screen in curiosity.\n\n**HELLO, SENATOR OOPLAMPOOLA** was burning on the screen in ocher letters.\n\nThere was a flashing box \"HELLO, VIRTUAL INTELLIGENCE.\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" Loovuu said.\n\nThe Senator tapped the box.\n\n**I HOPE YOUR DAY IS PLEASANT.**\n\nThe Senator turned to Loovuu. \"How did you convince it to stop migrating and penetrating other computer systems, which was the problem the DISRP kept reporting.\"\n\nLoovuu shrugged. \"I asked it.\"\n\n\\[[Real First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/f94rak/oc_pthok_eats_an_ice_cream_cone/)\\] \\[[first](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/16hzgya/the_dark_ages_01/)\\] \\[[prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/185f7bg/the_dark_ages_070/)\\] \\[[next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1887qg2/the_dark_ages_072/)\\]",

What happened, why things are in the state they are.\n\nWith the terrans gone, and the remaining humans pulled back and allmost hiding, the confed lost its drive. Add in the lose of the hypercom, and everything else, and the nature of the races that where left, of course things got a bit well crazy.  Most of the 'elder' races of the confed where/are conservatives, there cultural needs and goals are very diferent than the terran needs and goals. Posably, without even realizing it, they held the other races back, settled into a comfortable lifestyle and settled for contentment. Allmost, if not all the races, other than the terrans, where looking for contentment. The terrans pushed ahead because they are not content with contentment. THey allwayws want to drive for something more. The cats and dogs have been infuenced by this as well, though it seems they are starting to get kickbacks against it. The last gestalt chat was very much talking about how settled and relaxed and content there people where in general.  The terrans was that niggling thought saying allways that there could be something more, lets try harder, lets do more. WIthout the terrans, everyone settled on whats good enough, rather than striving for more. I mean really, they knew all this shit was out there, that thoes generators where just hanging around, and stuff like that, but, they did not put the effert out to go and tend to them, and keep them operational. Same with the anti margite facility.    ALso, we are looking at a lot longer than I was originaly expecting, from the numbers in the last story, about 34k years have passed sense the atrekna war.  Thats a lot of time, and its easy to see without something to drive them forward, them settling on there acomplishments, and thinking that everything is good enough.\n\nI am also wondering where the heck are all the terran groups that had moved to andromada and other galexys have gotten to. They should have been able to make it back to confed space by now, after all, the trips out took less than 8k years, so they should have been back by now, the ones that where coming back.",

        "body": "I have two boys.  When they stopped using diapers, I was at a loss on how to clean the bathroom.  It always smelled like pee, and there are little, hard to reach spots like the hinges on the toilet seat, etc.  I realized one day that just as urine (a liquid) drips into these hard to reach places, other liquids can do that, too.  So I started using a fail proof, easy method to clean the outside of the toilets.  Keep a collection of old towels you wouldn’t use to bathe.  Use the old towels to surround the area under the toilet.  Spray the hell out of the outside of the toilet with foaming bleach spray (wear a mask) and let it sit there for about ten minutes to disinfect.  It’s going to drip down to the floor which is what the old towels are for.  When you’re ready to finish up, grab a pressurized hand sprayer filled with water.  Rinse the cleanser off with the water sprayer.  Wipe down with paper towels to dry. Throw the towels in the wash with bleach.  It’s quick and easy.  Of course every once in a while I have to remove the toilet seat and do a deep clean, but between deep cleans, this works well for keeping the outside of the toilet clean.  It’s literally just spray bleach, sit for ten minutes, spray water, then wipe it all down and throw towels in the wash.\n\nFor the sink- every day after they go to school I fill the sink with a little bit of water to dilute the toothpaste spit.  Come back a while later and drain the water, wipe the toothpaste right out of the sink w/a paper towel. No scrubbing needed.\n\nPut your worst dishes in the sink with hot water and some Dawn soap.  When you come back it’s almost guaranteed as easy as rinse and dry! \n\nCascade Platinum in the dishwasher.  You can substitute vinegar for JetDry/ rinse aid.",

End recording\n\n\\----\n\nThe static cleared to show a paper gown clad biped sitting on a chair. Two legs, two arms. Bilateral design. Thickly muscled legs that made up 2/5 of the creature's height. Arms as long as the torso, another 2/5. The head had bilateral symmetry. Two eyes, one on either side of the nose, closely set together. Long nasal passages down the middle of the nose. Wide mouth. Heavy calcium exoskeletal protrusions inside the mouth of carnivore ripping and tearing teeth. Hair on the top of the head was a wooden red color, same with the thin lines of hair above the eyes. Eyes were strange. The left eye was divided in half, blue on one side, green on the other, the right eye was cold gray. It had two large mammary glands on the upper torso, wide muscular shoulders, a thick neck, and the arms ended in powerful grasping hands with four digits and an opposable thumb on each. On the right temple was embedded a black metal plate with five tiny green pinlights. On the back of the neck, hidden by the chair, was a socket with a closed iris sealing it shut. In the left hand was a holoprojector, hidden by the way the being held onto the arm of the chair. On the left forearm was a barely visible grouping of lines that sometimes lit up and displayed runes, again, hidden by the chair.\n\nThe biped was looking over the plasteel straps that held down its arms, then up at the camera. A strip of plasteel across the brow held its head in place. Its legs were banded to the macroplas chair, with a band of plasteel across its stomach and another across the chest, crushing the mammaries to its torso.\n\nThe light brightened, focusing on the face with blinding light.\n\nThe eyes had a single pupil that contracted rapidly. The eyeball was trembling slightly in the socket, constantly moving. An odd trick of muscle and nerve.\n\nFor a second the light caught the cornea lenses and made the eyes look like they were glowing a dull amber.\n\nFrom outside the view came a voice. Breathy and reedy, a Lurxu voice.\n\n\"State your name for the record,\" it commanded.\n\nThe pupil shifted slightly as the eyes looked left then right.\n\nThe biped's voice was low, rumbling. \"Carter, Consuela Raul Klikitikik. Chief Warrant Officer Two, 728446-1982-334619; Terran Confederacy of Aligned Systems Military Services - Army; Terran Descent Human.\"\n\n\"Define 'Chief Warrant Officer' for the record,\" the Lurxu voice commanded.\n\nThe biped merely repeated its statement.\n\n\"Define Terran Confederacy of Aligned Systems,\" the voice commanded.\n\nThe biped just repeated.\n\n\"Where, in galactic coordinates, is the Terran Confederacy of Aligned Systems located?\" the Lurxu asked.\n\nThe biped just repeated its statement.\n\nThe questions continued but the biped only gave the same answers to every question it was asked.\n\n\\-----\n\n**AUDIO-VIDEO FOOTAGE**\n\n**SALVAGE VESSEL UVARU TAK NASTREKU (PETAL OF THE STELLAR WIND)**\n\n**DEEP SPACE SALVAGE MISSION**\n\nThe bridge was cramped, filled with as much equipment as the limited space would allow, but all of the surfaces were clean and well maintained. Enamel had been applied where it had worn off on the corners and edges, the 2.5D screens were clean and in good repair, the stool seats were patched where time had forced the stitches to give it up.\n\nIn frame were three Lurxu salvagers. Four legs at the bottom of their barrel-like torso, the feet all facing different directions, the knees raised up to a third of the way up the torso, the four 'hip joints' surrounding a hard-lipped 'mouth' at the bottom of the torso. Eight eyes ringed the torso, giving a full view around the Lurxu. Four arms, each arm in between two legs. At the top were frond-like tissue that moved around to gather information. There were nozzles around the torso, allowing air intake and speech, as well as to allow the Lurxu to drink.\n\nOne was standing back, near the Captain's Stool. The other two were slighting leaning forward, looking at the screen.\n\n\"What is it?\" the Captain asked. \"Just a rock with high mineral content?\"\n\n\"Some kind of artificial object under all the dust,\" First Mate Heeluuhee said. He blinked his eyes twice and nervously fluttered his fronds. \"It still had power. Not much, sensors didn't pick up the power until we got within five thousand meters.\"\n\n\"How did you pick it up?\" the Captain asked.\n\nSensor Technician Leehoomeelee tapped his fingers on his knees. \"When we came out of transit-space, it broadcast a tightbeam transmission.\"\n\n\"What did it say?\" the Captain asked.\n\nThe Sensor Technician shook his fronds. \"Unknown. We're still trying to decode it. Nearly two gigabytes of data in a half second pulse. Nearly overloaded the communication buffers.\"\n\nThe Captain nodded. \"Lets send the shuttle over with Eenooloo and Ooloonuu. See if we found something valuable or just another dead piece of Forerunner junk.\"\n\nThe other two bridge officers nodded.\n\n\\-----\n\nStatic, then a squealing noise, then the video came on.\n\nTwo Lurxu were in hard-shell suits, next to a robot that was designed to cut into Forerunner hull plating with either a plasma torch, a molecular cutter, or a pressurized acid needle-spray.\n\n\"No intact stencils or markings, Captain,\" Eenooloo said, his voice low squeaking. He checked the robot, which was pressing its optics to a clear section of the hull that had the dust cleaned off. \"Eekvuu says there's atmosphere according to its laser spectrometer. Looks like nearly 98% argon with some trace helium, oxygen, hydrogen and carbon gas. Lots of dihydrogen-monoxide frost inside, makes it hard to see the surfaces inside. Hopefully it didn't corrode the inside too badly,\" Eenooloo paused a second. \"There's a few lights, looks like it still has power inside.\n\n\"Can you open it?\" The Captain's voice was tight with stress, the constriction of his speaking tubes making his voice slightly higher.\n\n\"Can you open it, Eekvuu?\" Eenooloo asked the robot.\n\nThe robot beeped back over the radio, moving over to another sectin.\n\n\"Eekvuu says it can see the hatch on the other side. We'll put up an airlock between the shuttle and this thing, crack the door, see if its good salvage,\" Eenooloo said.\n\nThe Captain nodded. \"Heeluuhee, get in close, but be ready to break contact. Damn the temporary airlock, just get clear if anything goes wrong,\" he looked at Leehoomeelee. \"These Forerunner artifacts can be dangerous.\"\n\nThe Sensor Technician rattled his fronds in agreement.\n\nLong moments passed while the shuttle maneuvered, then the airlock was set up. The robot went to work, first trying to get the keypad to work.\n\n\"Wait,\" Eenooloo suddenly said.\n\nThe robot cut off the power impulses to the dataplate, freezing in position.\n\nEenooloo looked in through the frosted over portal. \"Looks like the computers are coming on.\"\n\nThere was a tense minute or two.\n\n\"All right, go ahead,\" Eenooloo said.\n\nOoloonuu exhaled sharply through his breathing tubes.\n\nThe robot managed to find the wiring for the door and applied power. The door made a grinding noise for a long moment, then suddenly retracted. Atmosphere gushed into the interior of the artifact as the pressure equalized.\n\nThe inside was spacious by the standards of the Lurxu. Room to move around. Everything was covered in a thin layer of glittering H2O frost. There was light visible beneath the frost as the computers went to work.\n\nOoloonuu moved up and wiped the frost away.\n\nForerunner glyphs were streaming down the data screen.\n\nThe robot moved in, drifting around, scanning everything.\n\nIt suddenly stopped and made beeping noises across the radio.\n\nOoloonuu moved up as the robot cleared the frost from the half-cylinder embedded in the wall. It was shiny, like chrome, glimmering and gleaming beneath the frost.\n\n\"What?\" the Captain asked.\n\n\"Eekvuu says this not only has power, its what is using the majority of the power,\" Ooloonuu said. He looked at one readout covered in Forerunner runes. \"If I'm reading this right, and my Forerunner is a little rusty, power is at 7.62% but... oh... oh my.\"\n\n\"What?\" The Captain repeated, voice tight with anxiety so high that his fronds had rolled up and retracted into his barrel-like body.\n\n\"It says: Occupant Stable,\" Ooloonuu said. \"Th... thr.... thri... thrin... thrint Field Intact. No disruptions or interruptions,\" there was silence for a moment. \"Current Field Activation Time is... wow...  is \"BUFFER OVERRUN ERROR\" and that's it.\"\n\n\"It's been there a long time,\" the Captain mused.\n\nEenooloo looked up from one locker he had opened. \"Looks like a hardsuit designed for a biped.\"\n\n\"Were the Forerunners bipeds?\" the Captain asked.\n\nEenooloo nodded his fronds then felt foolish, knowing his Captain couldn't see them inside his vac-suit helmet. \"Some. There were also octopeds, hexapeds, and quadrapeds. Some insect, some mammals, some reptilian.\"\n\n\"Which was the occupant?\" the Captain asked. Part of him felt ecstatic. The Forerunner object was in excellent condition. Most Forerunner artifacts were heavily damaged by the war that destroyed them before the Lurxu had even developed much more than crude agriculture and animal husbandry, or by the long period of time that had passed.\n\n\"Can't really see them. They look like a blurred rectangle inside,\" Ooloonuu said. \"Must be the field.\"\n\nThe Captain clenched his four hands and relaxed them. \"All right.\"\n\nHe thought for a long moment.\n\n\"Seal it back up, bring it aboard. We'll sell it to the government.\"\n\n\\-----\n\n**EXCERPT OF PAGE 48 of 579**\n\ndevice is from the Forerunner conflicts, consistent with wreckage previously discovered and identified as a life-pod launched from a critically damaged starship. Forerunner iconography is present over the majority of the interior of Object-9173. Computer systems are adaptable and intact, without any apparent catastrophic loss of power.\n\nEstimations of space dust thickness puts the object at 34,183 years adrift. Interior of the object was kept at low pressure atmosphere with a non-corrosive noble gas (argon) and at near True Zero. Mechanical and electronic components were designed to withstand such environments for long periods of time, with multiple redundancies, and were in excellent condition.\n\nSingular occupant of the life-pod was determined to be a member of the Forerunner Species, Species 17 to be exact, and from initial scans appears to be a female of the species. Mechanical implants, known as cybernetics, are implanted in the temple (accessing the brain), in the upper torso cavity, in the left forearm and hand, as well as a type of socket that has wiring access to what is, upon initial examination, gross and fine motor control as well as several other brain sections.\n\nOccupant is currently still under effects of the stasis field, although it is reduced to partial power, allowing examination by sensor systems. Computer systems have provided safe atmospheric pressure and gas mixtures, as well as safe gravity, radiation, and temperature levels. The wide range of highly dangerous environments that the subject can withstand without aid is concerning, to say the least. The subject, according to the computers, is comfortable at a low level of atmosphere that would have a high statistical change of damaging Luxru breathing systems. It is comfortable at levels of heat that would damage Luxru sensory organs and at levels of cold that would cause a Luxru to die of exposure. Radiation levels include high levels of UV and IR radiation. It is nearly immune to electromagnetic energies and can withstand approximately twice Luxru normal gravity as comfortably 'normal' for its species.\n\nAdditionally, the field appears to completely negate the passage of time through a method of emitting a type of field that prevents other fields and particles from interacting within the field. How this works, how it is created, how it is emitted is unknown, as it defies all known particle and field interaction sciences.\n\nCurrently, it is the opinion of researchers that disengaging the field may be the only way to continue examination of the living specimen of Species 17. Concerns as to the dangers cannot be stressed enough, as the evidence of the Forerunner conflict has left scars all over known space. From planetary bombardments that cracked continental plates and caused a resonance in the liquid planetary core, to shattered moons that have become rings, to damaged stellar masses, the evidence is clear.\n\nThe Forerunners possessed vast power that they used to destroy each other in some kind of widespread conflict.\n\nWhile some state that a singular Forerunner represents a limited danger, nothing is known of the life form's capabilities beyond what it can survive in. Its dietary requirements, as provided by the computer, show that it can eat, digest, and gain nutrients from nearly anything biological, with a multi-layered immune system capable of even defeating a pus-pocket creating infection beneath its dermal surfaces.\n\nThat fact it can stand under its own muscular and skeletal design at *ten times Luxru standard gravity* shows that it possesses immense physical strength and resilience.\n\nIt is the findings of the scientific team that while the Species-17F subject is viable for reanimation that utmost caution should be\n\n\\-----\n\nThe 'survival pod' had been brought into a carefully constructed room. It had been removed, carefully and without interrupting power, into the facility and then into the room. White ceramic tile gleamed on the walls, floor, and ceiling. The lights were inset into the ceiling, providing light and shadow in the room. The room was at a high temperature, just over 295 Degree True, with a humidity of fifty percent. The atmospheric mix was painfully low on oxygen, thin to any Luxru who would be unlucky enough to be caught in it, but still survivable to Luxru physiology.\n\nThe scientists behind the cameras, one-way mirrors, and the windows all stared as a robot trundled up the 'survival pod' and tapped the buttons in the sequence that the life-pod's computer had given up after long research.\n\nThe robot sped away as the lights changed color from a dull pale blue to a green. There was hissing as vapor exploded from the bottom of the tube. The cameras saw that the field went out.\n\nInside was a a biped, cold looking bluish-white skin, hair on top of the head and above the closed eyes. It wore a single piece item of clothing without arms or legs. The skin of the legs and the arms were covered with fine hair that was nearly invisible.\n\nThe skin suddenly began to flush a peach color, the veins going from invisible to a bright blue, the color spreading from the left arm, across the body, into the face, and down the other arm. Temperature went from 153 Degrees True to 310 True in a matter of seconds, steam and vapor rising up off the body.\n\nThe top suddenly cracked open, withdrawing.\n\nThe scientists tensed.\n\nCould the creature, this Species 17F, endure reanimation procedures that looked brutal and painful.\n\nThere was the popping of electricity and instruments saw an electrical current that measured a shocking 1,000 volts and 20 amps pound through the middle of the Subject's chest.\n\nSeveral of the scientists exclaimed in shock, sure the system was killing the subject as it jerked, its back arcing, its arms coming up, its knees flexing.\n\nThe subject went limp.\n\nAfter a second there was a beeping and the whine of capacitors.\n\nThis time the jolt was 1,500 volts and 25 amps.\n\nAgain, the Subject convulsed.\n\nThe Luxru scientists argued to shut it down somehow as the Subject collapsed limp.\n\nAnother set of whines.\n\n2,000 volts, 30 amps.\n\nThis time the subject gave a whooping gasp, grabbing the edges of the capsule, kicking its legs.\n\nIt sat up, coughing and hacking. It bent over the tube, retching and hacking, and spit out a large gobbet of clear gel-like substance.\n\nThe scientists all leaned forward. They had all studied the lexicon the computer had provided.\n\nThe creature convulsed, its abdominal muscles rippling, and it hacked up more clear gel.\n\nIt hung over the edge, hacking for a moment, then wiped its mouth with a shaking hand.\n\nThe scientists recorded it all. Some were surprised by the speed of the projectile it had vomited from its mouth. Others were astounded by the fact that the vomit had not come from its singular stomach, but had rather been violently expelled from its lungs in fast order.\n\nThe creature sat up, looking around.\n\n\"Oh, what the ever loving <multi-use sexual expletive>?\" it asked.\n\nThe scientists all rejoiced, grasping hands and dancing around with their four feet, their top fronds waving with joy.\n\n\\-----\n\n\"It is a scientific specimen,\" UUnvuuloo stated, staring at the Martial Department representative. \"We only understand it because of the data provided by the intact computers on the object. It seems the Martial Department would be more interested in the pod itself.\"\n\nThe two agents from the Martial Department, wearing official black sashes around their barrel-like body below the ring of eyes and breathing nozzles, just stared.\n\n\"The fact an object of such small sized possessed a Transit-Space drive, even though it was badly damaged, as well as weapons of great power listed as 'point defense/debris counters' *and* the object possessed the ability to project energy screens to protect itself *despite* its small size, should be more interest than the living subject,\" UUnvuuloo said.\n\n\"We have our orders from the Dominion Scientific Council,\" the one of the left, who looked identical to the one on the right, right down to frond patterns, fluted coldly.\n\n\"Orders which make no sense. While the Subject refuses to answer questions and only responds by repeating the same phrase, does not mean that the Martial Department will have any more success than our scientists have had,\" UUnvuuloo said, shaking his fronds. \"I don't know what you expect to be able to wrest from the Subject, but I think it is a mistake to apply Martial Department procedures to it.\"\n\n\"We have methods you are unwilling to use,\" the right hand Martial Agent stated.\n\nUUnvuuloo shook his head. \"I would be careful approaching the subject with anything that it might consider to be violent,\" he said. \"I, and many others, believe that the Subject is only showing us what it wants to show us.\"\n\nThe left hand agent pointed at the screen, where the Forerunner Subject was sitting on a strangely designed chair, staring out the window and drinking a glass of highly corrosive H2O with citric acid additives.\n\n\"If comfort and ease won't persuade it to give us even the barest hint of information, perhaps applying some discomfort will work,\" the agent said.\n\n\"Why is it that every time there is great strides of science to be made, the government chooses the most offensive, thuggish minions it could find, minions that would not be out of place working as bouncers in a particularly odious brothel in the storm drains below the lowest slum?\" UUnvuuloo asked conversationally.\n\nBoth Agents jerked, one giving high tights flutings of offense.\n\n\"As soon as you don't get what you want immediately, you jump to applying force,\" UUnvuuloo said, shaking his fronds in amusement. He pointed at the screen. \"The Subject, completely nude, can withstand temperatures that would roast or freeze you, eat things that would eat or poison you, withstand humidity that would leave you drowning in your own lung tissue, handle radiation that would cook you alive by merely adjusting the melanin content of its skin, handle gravity that would cause you to collapse into heap of dying flesh,\" UUnvuuloo gave a fluting laugh.\n\n\"I'm sure whatever discomfort you come up will have to be administered by robots,\" he laughed.\n\n\"Be that as it may, the Martial Department's Office of Scientific Inquiry will be taking possession of the specimen,\" the left hand agent said.\n\nUUnvuuloo just shrugged. \"Ah, yes, I had nearly forgotten. The Dominion Senate Budgetary Proposals are due next month,\" he leaned back slightly on his stool seat, clenching the hard lips of his mouth against the synthetic seat. \"I'm sure you can wrest some more energy credits from the Dominion taxpayer by taking over the Specimen.\"\n\nWhen the two Agents looked outraged UUnvuuloo laughed.\n\n\"Take it,\" he said. \"And get the <fuck> out of my office.\"\n\n\\-----\n\nThe specimen sat on the constructed bench seat, looking out the window at the foggy day outside. The humidity was nearly 60%, making it foggy, the water vapor in the air choking and vision clogging. It narrowed its eyes several times, its eyes tracking something outside.\n\n\"Why is it acting like it can see through that soup?\" one of the guards asked.\n\n\"Who knows. It's a xeno,\" another shrugged.\n\n\"Can't wait till we drop it off. It looks stupid,\" the third said. He motioned and nearly dropped his folded rifle.\n\n\"Nice job, half-arms,\" the first one teased.\n\nThe Specimen looked at the three guards.\n\n\"Nice job, half-arms,\" it repeated.\n\nThe three blinked the eyes that faced the Specimen. One reached up for the mouthpiece/earpiece on the sash below its eyes.\n\nThere was a loud snap as the Specimen broke the high tensile flexible plastic restraint, reaching across with blinding speed to grab the headsets of all three Luxru guards. It grabbed all three together with both hands and twisted its hands in opposite directions.\n\nParts flew out.\n\nIt dropped the twisted and mangled mess, then leaned back, baring the meat tearing dentation in its strangely placed mouth.\n\nThe second one tensed his grip on the bar of his pistol, flipping his end-wrist so that the braced slapped against his forearm, the projecting screen lifting up and into place. The tiny micro-servos oriented the screen on the Specimen.\n\nThe Specimen reached out, put three fingers on top of the beam projection screen, and pushed its opposable thumb *through* the liquid crystal projection screen. The whole thing gave a squeal and the magic smoke eeked out of the screen as the Specimen pulled its hand back. It put its thumb in its mouth, made a sucking noise as it withdrew its thumb from its mouth, then bared its teeth again.\n\n\"It broke my pistol!\" the middle guard said. He lifted up the weapon, looking at it. The screen was punctured and the housing was bent at the top. The aiming servos were shredded and the battery had popped loose when the frame had warped. The middle guard shook his arm. \"Damn, that hurt!\"\n\nThe left hand one unfolded its rifle. The screen raised up, orienting, the small rotating sensor on the side beginning to twirl. The front firing assembly dropped down then unfolded, allowing the left hand Luxru to grab the aiming bar.\n\nThe Specimen watched with interested eyes.\n\n\"Don't move,\" the guard said.\n\nThe other one raised the burster up. It had a cuff around his forearm, the projection lattice snapping out nearly a half meter from the cuff, his hand dropping down to the squeezable firing handle. The goggles dropped down over two of his eyes.\n\n\"We have you targeted. Do not move,\" the right hand guard said.\n\nThe Specimen gave a roll of their eyes, a strange ocular movement, then went back to looking at the foggy day outside.\n\nThe right hand guard passed the middle his blaster pistol, the middle guard unfolding it so the projection screen faced the Specimen.\n\n\"You just know they're going to make me pay for that,\" he lamented.\n\nThe Specimen just sat silently, their face expressionless, their eyes watching things in the fog that the three Luxru couldn't see.\n\nAll three agreed, in the locker room, that they were glad to turn the Specimen over to the power armor clad guards.\n\n**END OF FILE**\n\n**CLOSING FILE**\n\n**ACCESSING CREDENTIALS**\n\n**DECRYPTING NEXT FILE**\n\n**PLEASE STAND BY**\n\n\\[[Real First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/f94rak/oc_pthok_eats_an_ice_cream_cone/)\\] \\[[first](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/16hzgya/the_dark_ages_01/)\\] \\[[prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/180rcdh/the_dark_ages_067/)\\] \\[[next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/185p4gm/the_dark_ages_071/)\\]",

In film we call this \"flagging\" off the light.\n\nC - It's been mentioned by one or two people, but circular polarizers can help if the reflections still persist.\n\nD - Change the angle you approach the subject with your dropper. \n\nE - Angle your camera a bit more offset.\n\nF - Even though this is last, it's worth noting that exposing your image appropriately is HUGE. What you essentially want is your subject to be lit WAY more brightly than anything else around it and for the shadows to be more pronounced because of it. But this only works if you set your camera to expose for your subject appropriately. If it overexposes, that means it's also mode likely to pick up other surroundings in the environment. This assumes you want a pitch dark backdrop.\n\nHope one or a few of these helps.",

Is that ok or totally wrong ? Same mix for village style sausages ? Is that anything close to American or complete fabrication ?\n\ne. ginseng flavored energy drinks, its some kind of ginger i believe.\n\nElaboration : Pickle sauce found the ingredients, they dont write the ingredients percentage but they are in an order of most to least, mayo, pickles, mustard, vinegear, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, citric acid. I imagine they are using sunflower oil mayo, which is the norm here if you want to get specific. We dont have many specialized burger places here, its usually a gyro shop that will have [just burger in their menu](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/18/5a/78/da/20190717-161222-largejpg.jpg). Only one kind, thats it. Its a pretty good deal because it comes in a box which would be normally used for pork chops, and in one side you get the burger and on the other fries, you get the fries for almost free. Very filling. Note the burger picture is the one the store uses for advertizement, usually isnt as pretty especially when delivered at home, and if you want cheese is extra charge.\n\n[The pizza sandwich](https://menshouse.gr/media/2019/06/13/la-rande-santouits1-710x533.jpg), the pizza place would make their own bread, its closer to a breadstick type bread, pretty hefty and then you get charged by the number of ingredients, lets say you get the garlicy tomato sauce with sausage and cheese, that would be a 3 ingredient sandwich, my broke ass in college would be like 2 sandwiches with double charge meatballs and then i would add things to them at home. Note the picture is very realistic, if not looks kinda bad, i think the person in the picture ordered a bianca or a white sauce one which is not common.\n\nAs for the cup I think the thought behind it is, americans eat fried chicken out of buckets, but we also need to be able to sell a personal size bucket, which is a cup.",

Most hamburgers are 100% beef, with a few outliers that use a custom grind including some bacon or something. There are things called burgers that aren't made with beef though, like chicken and turkey 'burgers'. Beef and pork blend is commonly used for meatloaf, however.",

But I wouldn’t at all say it makes it unAmerican, Mayo and pickles on burgers are very normal.\n\nB is 100% American. Especially the chicken in a bucket lol. Not so much used to cocktail sausages deep fried, except if it’s cornmeal batter and then it’s like a mini corn dog. I more commonly see them as an appetizer at parties wrapped in crescent roll dough and baked.\n\nC Never seen this before. One of the American pizza chains has something called a pizzadilla that’s supposed to be like an pizza quesadilla and it’s essentially just a small pizza folded in half. Is it sliced bread or pizza dough? I’m sure Americans have made sandwiches with pizza ingredients before because who doesn’t love a sandwich but I don’t think I’d call that typically “American.” It would be like a spin-off of a subgroup of American cuisine.\n\nD. Generally we use all beef for burgers, and if we use something different it would be noted, like ground beef with bacon, or a bison/turkey burger. I like mixing meats sometimes but usually more for meatloaf, I think the burger itself should be simple. I like to go crazy with the toppings but keep the patty more or less the same.

That's a common combination that Americans might use in [meatloaf](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Meatloaf) or in meatballs, but it'd be less common to find that in a burger. Also, we would usually just buy those separately. Occasionally a grocery store will sell a \"meatloaf package\" that is like half ground beef/half ground pork.

That sauce sounds a bit like a fairly common sauce we have, which includes mayo, ketchup, spices, and diced pickles. Some version of bacon cheeseburger is on the menu at 90%+ of all places that sell burgers. \n\nB. Never heard of deep fried cocktail sausages, but those other things are fairly normal fast-food stuff. Nobody really makes any of these things at home. \n\nC. Never heard of such a thing. Kinda interesting idea, though.\n\nD. There's nothing American about the 80/20 mix. Most sausages are made of all pork. Beef, turkey, and chicken are less common. Mixing different meats in sausage is not really a thing. It happens, but it's not a special American dish. It would be pretty unusual to make a burger out of this kind of mix, but meatballs are often made like that or with lamb instead of pork.\n\nE. We have ginseng energy drinks, but they're not a traditional thing at all.",

The sauce is basically tartar sauce, which isn't a common burger topping, it's more often served with fish and chips here. However, both mayo and pickles on a burger is common, so combining the two into a sauce seems fine.  \n3. Hamburger or burger if there is no cheese.\n4. Bucket of fried chicken? Very common, basically the fast food chain KFC. The bucket is generally family size. Not really \"Americans eat fried chicken out of buckets\" more \"this is a container that can easily hold a large amount of fried chicken to go.\"\n5. Mix of fried things as an app including shrimp and onion rings, common. Deep fried cocktail sausages less so. We do have deep fried corndogs (hot dogs deep fried in a cornmeal batter), but that's probably a breadier batter than what your getting.  \n6. Pizza sandwich looks similar to a calzone, but that's usually made with regular pizza dough. Typically this is served with the sauce on the side.   \n7. Burgers are usually 100% beef, but some places do mix it with other meats. Other dishes like meatloaf are usually a mix, beef pork and veal is common. So your mix is close enough.\n8. Ginseng is often in energy drinks, but they wouldn't usually be considered ginseng-flavor. Citrus or fruit is more common.",

    "body": "A Hooch primer for N00Bs.\n\nVersion 1.0.\n\n\nSo with my limited hoochy knowledge I thought I'd put together a guide that helps noobs with making low-cost fermentations. With Prison Hooch we are mostly assuming you're just cheap/in an area where there's limited homebrew supply/up for a challenge rather than in actual prison, but for fun we'll keep a bit of plausibility that you could actually make this stuff in prison.\n\n\nNote: I will not be liable for anyone underage that tries to make this hooch. If you're a kid reading this, please go away and keep your brain cells intact.\n\n\n**Part 1: Fermentation Vessel**\n\nTo hooch, you'll need something to hooch in.\n\n**Homebrewer's way:** Normally this is a sealed vessel (bucket or carboy) fitted with an airlock. If you're going to buy anything from a homebrew store, an airlock filled with water or sanitiser is the safest way to ensure your brew is sanitary and won't have any visiting creatures. For very vigorous fermentation, you can fit a blow-off tube (tube running from the fermentor into a smaller container with sanitiser).\n\n\n**Cheapskate way:** As long as gases can escape, you'll be reasonably okay. You can fit a balloon or condom with a hole pierced in it to the top of your vessel. Make sure you put some rubber bands around to keep it tight. This is has slightly more upkeep than an airlock as you'll want to keep an eye on it in the beginning to ensure your fake-airlock doesn't over inflate. Also, don't reuse the condom and get prison babies. A bucket or carboy is great, but you can plausibly use any vessel that can withstand pressure ie. plastic jug, soda bottle, etc. DO NOT USE: glass that is not specifically for brewing.  This is can be too weak for the amount of gases and could end explosively. You don't want a bomb.\n\n\n**Prisoner way:** You can get by without an airlock, however you will need to 'burp' your container daily (or more than once a day at the start). This is easiest with a soda bottle as you can feel the pressure easily. Just loosen the lid just enough to let out the CO2, and re fasten. Or, do an open fermentation at the beginning when a lot of CO2 gas is escaping - usually there isn't great risk of airborne infection when fermentation is vigorous. Open ferment for 12-24 hours than proceed to 'burp' your container whenever pressure is feeling high. If you forget to do this and pressure gets too high it will explode. So if you're not in prison, just spend your $3 and invest in a fucking airlock.\n\n**Part 2: Sanitation**\n\nYou'll need to clean all the equipment that comes in contact with the brew. Homebrewers buy cleaners like PBW and sanitiser such as StarSan. Make sure you do not mix acid and alkaline cleaning agents (ie. PBW and Starsan together) or you will make chlorine gas. However bleach will also work, a 5% solution is ideal. My preferred way is to fill a bucket with sanitiser and soak every piece of equipment before brewing. You can also boil metal equipment to sanitize it.\n\n\n**Part 3: Fermentables**\n\n\nAs long as it has sugar, you can brew with it. Well mostly. Products with a lot of preservatives can have an odd effect on yeast viability, you can add a small amount of preserved goods to your brew but the largest part cannot be full of that stuff.\n\nIn this case we're going to just do sugar and fruit, even though there are lots of other options (malt, rice, sorghum, etc) these two are the most easily accessed. You need to anticipate the flavour of your fermentable without any sweetness to it, as all the sugar will be consumed by the yeast. This means some things (ie. apples) taste awesome fermented, and other things (ie. molasses) taste like absolute ass.\n\nTable sugar and honey are safe bets for a high fermentation yield, though sugar by itself will taste pretty bad, it's the simplest way to make hooch. 1kg of sugar (100% fermentable) in 5 litres of solution (or 1.3 gallons for yankees) will give you around 7.5% alcohol.\n\n\nFruit can make your hooch taste a lot better, however. Sweet fruit that we mainly ferment have different types of acidity in their juices. You have Tartaric (found in grapes - wine), Malic (apples, pears etc) and Citric acid. Citrus fruits are the easiest to make juice from and will be a tempting option, however they impart a strong sour flavour when fermented. To make a more balanced brew you can use a base of Tartaric or Malic fruits, or honey (eg. mead). Honey is expensive as fuck so we'd recommend apple juice for hooch newbies. Most apple juices aren't preservative loaded and trustworthy to ferment. However, if you just want alcohol content, have at it any way you want.\n\n\nFruit has a much lower content of fermentable sugars and is only an estimate at best. Here's a fun table. Data was retrieved from [Advanced Winemaking Basics: Sugars in Winemaking](http://winemaking.jackkeller.net/sugar.asp)\n\n    Grams fermentable in each 100 grams of fruit (sorry USA, 1 oz is about 28 grams)\n    Apples, raw, unpeeled 13.3\n    Apple juice, unsweetened\t10.9\n    Apricots, raw\t9.3\n    Apricots, dried\t38.9\n    Advocados, raw\t[0.9]\n    Bananas, raw\t15.6\n    Blackberries, raw\t7.9\n    Blueberries, raw\t[7.3]\n    Cantaloup, raw\t[8.7]\n    Carambola, raw\t[7.1]\n    Cherries, raw, Sour\t[8.1]\n    Cherries, raw, Sweet\t[14.6]\n    Cranberry juice cocktail\t13.5\n    Currants, raw\t[8.0]\n    Dates, dried\t[64.2]\n    Figs, raw\t[6.9]\n    Figs, dried\t[66.5]\n    Grapefruit, raw\t[6.2]\n    Grapefruit juice, fresh\t[6.3]\n    Grapefruit juice, canned\t7.5\n    Grapes, raw, American\t[16.4]\n    Grapes, raw, European\t[18.1]\n    Grape juice, frozen concentrate reconstituted\t14.2\n    Guava, raw\t6\n    Jackfruit, raw\t18.4\n    Kiwifruit, raw, without skin\t[10.5]\n    Kiwifruit, canned, in syrup\t[12.8]\n    Lemons, raw, peeled\t2.5\n    Lemon juice, raw\t[2.4]\n    Limes, raw, peeled\t0.4\n    Mangos, raw\t14.8\n    Nectarines, raw\t[8.5]\n    Oranges, raw, peeled\t8.9\n    Orange Juice, fresh\t10.2\n    Orange juice, frozen concentrate reconstituted\t10.6\n    Papaya, raw\t[5.9]\n    Passion fruit, raw\t11.2\n    Peaches, raw\t[8.7]\n    Peaches, canned in juice\t[17.4]\n    Peaches, dried\t[44.6]\n    Pears, table, raw\t[10.5]\n    Pears, canned in water\t6.1\n    Pears, canned in juice\t9.7\n    Pears, canned in light syrup\t12.1\n    Pears, canned in heavy syrup\t15.2\n    Pear juice, fresh\t[8.7]\n    Pineapple, raw\t11.9\n    Pineapple, canned in juice\t[14.2]\n    Pineapple, canned in heavy syrup\t[16.9]\n    Pineapple juice, canned\t12.5\n    Plums, common, raw\t[7.5]\n    Plums, common, dried\t[11.7]\n    Pomegranates, raw\t8.9\n    Prunes, dried\t[44.0]\n    Prune juice, bottled\t[13.4]\n    Raisins\t[65.0]\n    Raspberries, red, raw\t[9.5]\n    Rhubarb, raw\t[0.9]\n    Strawberries, raw\t[5.7]\n    Strawberries, frozen, unsweetened\t[6.5]\n    Tangelos, raw\t[7.4]\n    Watermelon, raw\t[9.0]\n\nSo for example, if I were to make a Watermelon brew, I would need around 11kg of Watermelon if I was going to replace my original 7.5ABV sugar brew 1:1 with Watermelon, to meet the same fermentable sugar content.  Experimentation is key and it's probably best to balance your cheaper fermentables with other additions.\n\n\n**Part 4: Yeast**\n\n\nThe most obvious yeast you can get is bread yeast, or brewing yeast, from stores. Note if you get brewing yeast, you need to go to a homebrew store as the \"Brewer's yeast\" supplements sold by pharmacies are well and truly dead. The yeast consume sugar and excrete alcohol. They are your buddies and you need to be nice to them, which means keeping your brew at a safe temperature (10-28C at a stretch, 15-22C is ideal). Otherwise your workers will all be dead instead of getting to it. A normal pitch for dried yeast is around 20-40g, we won't be talking liquid yeast because this is hooch.\n\n\nSecond possible source of yeast is out in the wild. Yeast already exists on most fruit, so as long as it's not pasteurised (processed/heated up to kill bacteria), you can expect a wild fermentation to occur. This is more random than bought yeast but can yield good results. Most mead is made with a wild fermentation from honey. There's lots of places you can find yeast. You can't ferment using vegemite, marmite, or other yeast-based spreads, these are well and truly dead. However dead yeast (ie. boiled bakers' yeast) can be used as a nutrient to help the live yeast grow.\n\n**Part 5: GO**\n\nNow you have all the steps to make hooch. Wait 14 days for fermentation to complete, and you get alcohol. I could explain carbonation and stuff but I can't be bothered. Please use google if you'd like to learn about making your flat wine into a fizzy beverage.",

Between insider knowledge, browsing restaurant food suppliers, and teasing out clues from the nutritional facts, I think I've finally cracked it!\n\nRaising Cane's Sauce:  \n(Specific ingredients I've used are in parentheses,.)\n\n150g Extra Heavy Mayo ([Hellmann's](https://www.amazon.com/Hellmanns-Mayonnaise-Gallon-Extra-Heavy/dp/B00061ENRO/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3HSBUJR5M8FBL&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.qI-aipwnoPWfkcEhmBDhmgUBvwwYT1kCYDf3jdrmO-IvDSh9YJ95KuiK35elDr7Ij2QQwaSb522DdHx2Wfb1DvT-FWwJdTZ1usGhxZHKMXFTLr1pbvfSwzzU2Xnveoqe4A8inZ3TYVNGffl7Q9HJZsWkBR1fa97u8zy4I2tEDO3uutW404TMTQt0nnetVTA4Yi36FrEL2G3AMEuwvldud_tsz-lChasYpTwg3VGpL_A1eajDfvAGyDeaUbPbf11K8eOnS3ll-F63Okkq4HtFyJ7xIhcla6p7Zufe32ixVbM.ImxCnXl4hxtXK5fyvk8HPxQ6Xere8JxcWXXtsoh6CtA&dib_tag=se&keywords=extra+heavy+mayonnaise&qid=1722599616&sprefix=extra+heav%2Caps%2C160&sr=8-5), but I suspect Kraft)  \n106g Ketchup (Heinz)  \n16g Worcestershire Sauce (Lea & Perrins (US), but I suspect they might use French's...)  \n1/2 tsp. Lemon Pepper ([McCormick Culinary Lemon & Pepper Seasoning Salt](https://www.amazon.com/McCormick-Culinary-Lemon-Pepper-Seasoning/dp/B008OGCH8K/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1DSV5QN5FE60C&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.oU6WL76ZpHDL2PT-SDC9E_7u2FoEhgjDgaZe9JgiJF6tPDzPnoyraRyOReJkfEXz0GFn0GKqyHQzBz_oawFTAaRB4Mk9kX-hXOkVXOTZecm8K1cHwmzU1jID8ZNcl9gugqf9pmw5xLSQWIeP1rTrsXCzBPtSvuTOVX-TF62nXgtH-oClkASKJrBULMT0ukMNMucNrj3N2xwPvKe_hzRwUtRxPfH7cz40UOdP6P1hsV-m6T0d5BLtK6I0UpkDXJv1gDaIAVO7usvudJ3Ho1WW9FfzyFJhlWF8f8VOUL1F1J8.SCXPDNAjIStC915oqMXswIuzWernvXlDZMKKMpZx-rc&dib_tag=se&keywords=mccormick+seasoning+lemon+pepper&qid=1722599685&sprefix=mccormick+seasoning+lemon+%2Caps%2C178&sr=8-4))  \n1/2 tsp. Garlic Salt (McCormick)\n\nJust whisk it all together and let it sit for a day in the fridge!\n\nEdit:  \nFor those that don't like the idea of Lemon Pepper, I finally got around to purchasing some [citric acid](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EYFKM32/ref=twister_B0BS9NXKW2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1) and got back to experimenting. I might actually like this version just a little better...\n\nInstead of 1/2 tsp. Lemon Pepper, use 1/2 tsp. Black Pepper (Fine/Medium) + a small pinch of Citric Acid (I used less than half of a 1/8 tsp.).\n\nVery similar, but think the non-lemon pepper version holds up better after sitting for a few days.\n\nEdit2:  \nWhite Pepper fans! I've been making a mix of 2 tsp.[ Fine Black Pepper](https://www.amazon.com/Rani-Premium-Indian-Non-GMO-Natural/dp/B00307JVVY/ref=sr_1_80_sspa?crid=35JBPDSQBZOM2&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.CMj5tq3CVQy0TypTndB-EaxIpZwl27Wo_U9MorE0BcR5a0_RMANDrr775ha1z8TzHbZk6QbMoRDNQK-DcDZYlM9POaFGGzRp__3WwqDeny8kZAzueZdeZeGY1F_XWxnr_rvTMeNwXHbCYHr5Zfb-ovU1xRiTyauxkQ_fVxbt0SBS5VxYY4mRtfqpWQYtPrb4AIlJifXHjMQxh2WUMFRrH0pI9sJL8PUzTvaimTEieVFQ7wlQORwg1bzi9_mb92jOhq-nXz04QPtFzppzw1QmbNitVwJ9_kttM5Hdm45ZNSs.mTpYI-qVIy5LsoeuzLmEne3bImSlM_ULpe-toOh0J2g&dib_tag=se&keywords=fine%2Bblack%2Bpepper&qid=1724913269&sprefix=fine%2Bblack%2Bpepp%2Caps%2C194&sr=8-80-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9tdGY&th=1), 3/4 tsp. Medium Black Pepper, 1/4 tsp White Pepper, 3/8 tsp. Citric Acid.\n\nMix it up and store in a small container. Use 1/2 tsp. of the pepper mix in place of the 1/2 tsp. Lemon Pepper.\n\nNot sure if it's authentic (and still in development), but will certainly be in my \"Cane's rotation\" from time to time.",

    "body": "This sub seems to love BKF (myself included) so I thought I'd write a post detailing the chemistry behind it. My background is as a PhD organic chemist but recently I've also dealt some in formulating cleaning/sanitizing chemicals.\n\nThe key ingredient for BKF is oxalic acid. It's really what differentiates it from other similar products. As far as I know it's one of the few products that uses it. From the latest SDS I've seen, the ingredients are glass oxide, oxalic acid, and some surfactant. The glass oxide can't be overlooked because it makes up the bulk of the product and serves as an abrasive. But as I mentioned, oxalic acid is the key. For those of you who may not know, oxalic acid is the simplest of the dicarboxylic acids. You can think of it as acetic acid (acid in vinegar) but with an acid on both ends and quite a bit more acidic. So when compared to vinegar it's more acidic.\n\n It's also a good chelator meaning in can bind metal ions. This makes it great for soap scum and hard water buildup which are largely comprised of salts of Mg and Ca. Sodium dodecyl sulfate, a surfactant in almost all soaps tends to react with hard water and precipitate this soap scum. This is also why it's also effective on rust being able to bind the Fe. \n\nOxalic acid is also decent for the passivation of stainless steel. This is essentially a reaction done on the outermost layer of steel which make it more resistant to corrosion. I typically do this with nitric acid or citric acid, but oxalic acid also can work. That means that cleaning your sink with it also helps protect the metal.\n\n Some people have concerns with the toxicity of oxalic acid. As I mentioned it's a great chelator and thus can chelate ions vital to your body and form oxalate salts toxic to your kidneys. But this shouldn't be a concern unless you plan on eating lots of BKF (which I discourage). Anyway, some of you may already be aware of all of this, but hopefully some of you found it interesting and informative. Let me know if you have any questions and I'll do my best to answer. I'm in no way affiliated with BKF but I have been working with oxalic acid a lot recently.\n\nEdit: By popular demand, I've decided to employ a novel formatting technique...the paragraph.",

He stayed seated behind his desk and tilted his head to one side. “Deputy Engineer, what can I do for you?”\n\n “It’s the Chief,” said Mon, holding xir first set of hands clasped together, nervously. “I confess to be worried about his mental state and general health.”\n\n Thrills were known to be a race of healers and carers, coming from their evolutionary line of hive-based societies. The Chief Medical Officer on the *Endeavour* was a Thrill. “Why are you worried?”\n\n “His behaviour has been… erratic, the last three shifts. His voice became faint, then disappeared altogether. Chief Medic Doran signed him off for one week, and he has remained in his quarters with his pet feline ever since. His card has not been logged through the commissary, but he has been seen using food dispensers near his quarters at odd hours of the ship’s cycle. I pulled the last three records of his usage.” Mon carefully placed a data chip on the Captain’s desk.\n\n Thrajj picked it up and fed it into the reader on the desk. “Liquid foods.”\n\n “We know how much he likes a solid meal, even more so than the other Humans on the ship. No, I am more concerned with the last item on the list.”\n\n “Why is that? It looks like the standard checmical composition for water.”\n\n “He asked for water at boiling point. I checked the chemical makeup of that last additive. It’s an acid.”\n\n Thrajj frowned. “Acid?”\n\n “He’s requested a gallon of boiling acid then went back to his room, and now he’s not answering his comm line!” said Mon, agitated now.\n\n “Mon, calm down,” said Thrajj, lowering his big, horned head. “How many times have you shipped out with Humans?”\n\n “This is my second cruise, Captain.”\n\n “I was a young ensign when the Human Federation first took to the stars and made contact,” said Thrajj. “This is my fifty-second year of having Humans on my ships. Now, I’ll let you in on a secret.” He leaned forward, and a smile formed on his lips. “With the Humans, there is always an explanation. They are a hardy species, they come from a homeworld that will kill you or I, but not only did they survive it, they tamed it. Then they went into space, and they tamed a lot of other worlds as well. And with Humans, there is always a reasonable explanation. Come, we shall go and see what the Chief Medic has to say, and then we shall go and see Chief MacDonald.”\n\n ===\n\n “I signed him off for one ship week, that is correct,” said the CMO, another Thrill who went by Doran Dom. “He has a mild viral infection, but one I have had experience in dealing with in the past. it is not transmissible to any of the other crew except other Humans, so it appears as if he has quarantined himself to avoid infecting others.”\n\n “Have you any idea why he would request a gallon of boiling acid?” asked Thrajj.\n\n “As to that, I have no idea,” said Dom. “His mental state when he left here was fine.”\n\n ===\n\n “Cap’n”, said the broad voice of Chief MacDonald. “I’d offer to let you in, but I don’t want the crew catching what I have.”\n\n He sounded… hoarser that he normally did, as though his voice hadn’t been used in a few days and he was trying to remember how to use it. The tiny viewscreen on the panel outside his room showed the Chief’s face, as much of it as could be seen behind the flaming red beard.\n\n “That’s fine, Chief, we can talk like this. Your deputy is very worried about you.”\n\n “Ach, I’m fine. Or I will be in another few days. I have the dispenser down the hall and Pancake here to keep me company.” He hoisted the calico cat into the camera’s view. Pancake miaowed.\n\n “Can you explain the boiling acid you requested from the dispenser?” asked Mon, fretfully.\n\n “Boiling acid?” repeated MacDonald, a look of puzzlement on his face.\n\n “Your last three requests from the dispenser were two helpings of a hot liquid meal, and a gallon of boiling acid. We’’d like to know what that’s for,” said Thrajj.\n\n The Chief stared for a second, before bursting out laughing.\n\n “Oh, stars, oh my, that’s…” he broke off, tears of mirth running down his face. “I requested hot water with lemon, so I could add honey to it for my sore throat. It’s an old method of getting fluids and electrolytes into a sick person. Did you think I would do something stupid with it?”\n\n “Thrills have a duty of care to their comrades,” said Mon stiffly.\n\n “Mon, my friend, you could have asked and I would have told you. Look, when you say boiling acid, it makes it sound so much worse than it is. It’s citric acid, from fruits grown on Earth. We take the fruit and slice it up, we add honey from bees, and we pour hot water on top and mix it all up.” \n\n “You weren’t answering your comm!” xe shouted.\n\n “I apologise,” said the Chief gravely. “I was probably asleep. I took a pill last night to help me sleep.”\n\n “How soon will you be back to work?” asked Thrajj.\n\n “If Chief Dom will sign me off, I can be back the day after tomorrow. I feel much better, but I’d rather wait and make sure I’m completely clean before I rejoin the crew.”\n\n “Very well, Chief. Thank you for your time.”\n\n “Thank you, Captain, Deputy.”\n\n “See?” said Thrajj, once the screen had gone dark. “Always a reasonable explanation.”\n\n “Boiling. Acid.”\n\n Thrajj snorted. “This is nothing. Come, we shall have a drink and I will tell you of the time a bunch of Humans taped a knife to a cleaning robot…”\n\n ",

    "body": "First post here, I'll try my best to get everything right. Also probably not your typical MIL story so I hope it fits.\n\nThere's a few brief details I'll need to explain before this story makes sense: first off, I have a weird dietary condition that leaves me unable to digest citric acid and acetic acid. That means no juicy fruits, no sauces, no alcohol (once I'm old enough) and most importantly, NO VINEGAR. I've told this to NPC several times (at least ten) and she continues to try and feed me lemons and vinegar, being shocked when I remind her that I can't fucking digest them.\n\nSecondly, we call her the NPC because she's got the processing power of Windows Vista running on a microwave. She's got several dialogue options. Three. She has three dialogue options before she runs out of topics. She is also a terrible human being, but I imagine a part of that comes from her NPC-ness.\n\nFinally, my SO's parents are older Mormons (this will be important later). NPC moved several states away from her husband because she doesn't believe in divorce but she hates him. She sells essential oils and mooches like a professional.\n\nAnyway. The good part.\n\nMy SO and I married young and poor. We got engaged the day after I graduated high school and got married in August, right before college. Because of this, we had a potluck at our reception, which FFIL smoked ten pounds of brisket for. FFIL requested that in exchange for this, we fetch NPC from the airport. Seemed simple enough.\n\nIt's worth noting we live halfway between nowhere and more distant nowhere. The nearest airport is three hours away. NPC did not want to fly out for our wedding, because she teaches piano and \"she had students\". FFIL bought the Uber and the plane ride and she finally decided maybe she wanted to come to her own son's wedding. \n\nWe get to the airport and call her up. She's lost. In the clearly labeled airport. \"I can't find the luggage claim!\" \"I can't find the exit!\" We end up looping the pick-up area six times before she finally makes it out. I'm hoping she'll at least be quiet for the drive home. No sir, not a chance.\n\nAfter exhausting our dialogue options with NPC (things like \"how was the flight\" and \"how is life in *other state*\"), she begins to insult SO and FFIL. This isn't unusual. She also stated how she still hates her daughter, FSIL, for \"invading her home with her children\". Direct quote: \"she wasn't bruised or anything, I still think she was lying about being abused. She's just lazy.\" Sure, NPC.\n\nAbout halfway home, she breaks the tense silence and declares to myself and SO: \"you're too young to get married!\" We ask why. \"I don't know, you just are! It's expensive!\" We explain we've done the math and getting married will be the cheaper option. \"well, you should wait until after college. What if OP gets *pregnant*?\" To her, this was a scandal. To me, it was fucking hilarious. I laughed in her face. \"NPC, I've been on birth control for years.\" \n\nThese were not the correct words. For NPC, this is an unforgivable sin, up there with drinking black tea or watching anime. She looked at me horrified and said \"but you'll go to hell for that.\" We've had this discussion with NPC before, and in classical NPC fashion, she is incapable of processing the fact that some people, such as myself and SO, do not believe in a hell. I just grin at her and say \"yeah, probably.\"\n\nEventually, the discussion turns to what she'll be bringing to our wedding in terms of food. NPC has decided on a crisp, refreshing vinegar pasta salad. The following conversation ensues.\n\nSO: sounds good, but OP can't eat that.\n\nNPC: what? Why not? Does she not like pasta?\n\nSO: ...\n\nSO: she's allergic to vinegar.\n\nNPC: I've never heard of that before. Why didn't anyone tell me? I'm bringing it anyway. I copied the recipe already, I'm not changing my plan.\n\nShe did, in fact, bring the vinegar pasta salad. I didn't eat any, but it was a bit irritating. She also felt that wearing a t-shirt and skirt to our wedding was appropriate, and made my brother (our usher) incredibly uncomfortable by following him around aimlessly after the ceremony. Overall, the wedding was great despite her, and I'm glad she lives far enough away that we never have to interact with her.",

Anyone want to have a poutine party?\n\nEdit: It looks like there's some interest! I have forks and dishes to serve it in. 2 things we'll need is a location, and a way to heat the gravy and cook the fries. Does anyone have a deep fryer or industrial size oven? Would Saturday night or Sunday work?\n\nEdit 2: We have a discord server started! Thanks to u/Holylolicon. Message me for a link!\n\nEdit 3: I'm maxed out on mouths to feed! This has been an overwhelming response and my wife is weirded out, but happy that I'm giving away our poutine to random internet friends. We're currently trying to get a plan organized and I'm sorry to anyone that wanted to come, but I can't feed everyone. On the day of the poutine party, I can post a last minute update of where we are and everyone is welcome to come say hi, but we will be out of poutine. Thank you!\n\nWhat needs to happen is simple. We need a venue that can host with a kitchen. Please PM me or post in the discord if you have access to something \n\nGravy ingredients for those asking. It's a powder and needs to be mixed with water: Modified corn starch, Pea flour, Sugars (corn maltodextrin, sugar), Palm oil, Salt, Hydrolyzed soy protein, Onion powder, Caramel, Yeast extract, Tomato powder, Spices and herbs, Garlic powder, Disodium inosinate, Disodium guanylate, Citric acid, Soy lecithin, Natural flavour, Ascorbic acid, Thiamine hydrochloride, Silicon dioxide.",

    "body": "I am devastated. I have been educating myself, spending crazy amounts of money, doing so many water changes, and my entire group of 24 fish got wiped out while I was taking a final at college. \n\nHere are the details:\n\nEverything was fine yesterday, and this morning at 8am.\n\nThe pictures of tests are when I came home and found them all dead. I immediately tested the water, to see if there was an ammonia spike. There wasn't. In fact, the ammonia is better than when I tested it yesterday. The Nitrate was a little worse though, but not even close to previous levels 2 weeks ago.\n\nThe tank is almost a month old, I transfered everything from a UNS 60L that was doing well. I waited 2 weeks of cycling, because I added new soil, before the tank stabilized and I felt comfortable getting some fish. I have been adding beneficial bacteria (API Start) since the beginning, and did 30%ish water changes every other day. I added 20 shrimp, 5 pygmy corydoras, 12 ember tetras, and 12 celestial pearl danios. The CPDs were the last addition, about 3 days ago. I know it's over stocked, but it's a heavily planted UNS60U with a Biomaster 250T, and i hoped that the house plants would help filter the excess waste.\n\nYesterday I bought the house plants and put them in the aquarium. I cleaned the roots as best I could, but the plant on the far right still had/has some dirt in them. I would guess that there is a parasite that killed all my fish, but for some reason my shrimp are also acting up, and my pygmy corydoras are alive. My pygmies immediately felt way better after I did a massive water change.\n\nI transfered the shrimp to a 5 gallon that i have that is 3 months old and stable. Hopefully they will recover. \n\nThe only other guess I have is co2 levels. I just refilled my co2 generator two days ago, and the drop checker was almost orange when I got back from my final. I turned it off for now. \n\nI have no idea what happened. Anybody have any ideas? Please don't be mean. Thanks in advance. \n\n\nMore details:\nUNS 60u\nMixture of UNS Controsoil (that was added during the transfer), Neo soil, and a tiny bit of Fluval substrate.\nCo2 injected, by a Clscea co2 backing soda and citric acid generator. I keep track of levels with a co2 drop checker.\nFilter is a biomaster 250 thermo, either added biological ceramic media from the 60L.\nPlants are HC Cuba, Hygrophilia Pinnatifida, Ludwigia Super Red, S repens, Anubias Nana Petite, Hydrocotyle Tripartite, and another stem that i can't remember.\nI got the house plants from Home Depot, I have no idea what they are they just looked cool\nLight is a Week Aqua M Pro 600, in for 8 hours a day\nI got all of the fish from my LFS\nI dose API fertilizer once a week, always after a water change\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "Okay real talk, **STOP brute forcing glycolysis into your brains!** You're making it *much* harder than it needs to be.   \n  \nIf you actually see the logic behind it, you won’t need a mnemonic—it’ll automatically stick. In fact, mnemonics just become a tool to *increase efficiency* rather than something to memorize. Dr. Ebbinghaus (🥂) would still want you to revisit it occasionally (maybe while brushing your teeth), but after understanding it once, reviewing the pathway takes just minutes (less than 2)!\n\n* I made this **visual breakdown** that walks through the glycolysis pathway, step-by-step. This isn't just a cheat sheet, though. I take you on a journey where you get to **discover** it for yourselves!\n   * In Stage 0, I just want you to notice what is the difference between step to step.\n      * Pay attention to the way phosphate moves. That's the key!\n   * In Stage 1, we start naming the molecules. At this point, we need to make sense of why the naming happens. I've color coded it to give you a leg up on this.\n   * In Stage 2, we start figuring out which enzymes are present in the pathway. If you've done your due diligence, you will be able to figure out the reason for why those enzymes are in play. Additionally, I've added in functions of those class of enzyme.\n      * Enzymes have a predictable logic. Understand what they **do** and you won't be recalling each individually.\n   * In Stage 3, we will determine which steps are reversible or irreversible. As we know there is a rate-limiting step; this will be occurring in Step 3 of the pathway.\n   * In Stage 4, we hit upon the High-Yield Information (there can be more, **and** you'll be able to figure out why that information makes sense).\n\n[Stage 0: Pay attention to the way Phosphate moves. I'm discovering it alongside you.](https://preview.redd.it/ppi4jbixhofe1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad711f58cdf4201e0691f757a017a5c99836aeb6)\n\n[Stage 1: Start building out the names!](https://preview.redd.it/tixy0cixhofe1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=d16cd12ce48b0a53694825d860cf6b3ca3b10fbb)\n\n[Stage 2: Let's figure out enzymes. Form follows function!](https://preview.redd.it/25fpokixhofe1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=5352ecbdc86e459c828e451464356aa9b34dc31c)\n\n[Stage 3: To reverse or not to reverse? That is the question.](https://preview.redd.it/wsugmcixhofe1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=378068b6bce9abbd816fc07e6a42d6b3e8a83c57)\n\n[Stage 4: Let's add in some High Yield Information!](https://preview.redd.it/jm736eixhofe1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=592944dcf7b482f9e7f2f6fceca676e1c66336e1)\n\n* Exercises left to the reader (let's see if you're paying attention!)\n   * Yields of ATP, NADH, and Pyruvate have been stated. However, their occurrence within the cycle has not. Where do they occur?\n   * What steps are considered the *energy investment* phase? What steps are considered the *energy payout* phase?\n   * I've visualized glucose in a linear shape to help with the learning process. What other compounds are present in a ring structure?\n   * Advanced! Why is glycolysis (+ Krebs cycle \\[aka Citric Acid Cycle\\]) considered the central metabolic pathway?\n\nDid this give you an \"A-ha!\" moment? Or did I miss something crucial? Let’s make this the last-stop shop for understanding MCAT glycolysis—drop your thoughts below! Let's get this 528!  \n  \nTL;DR: I gave you the best (self-proclaimed 😜) beginner guide to understanding glycolysis. It works in stages (0 through 4), and you'll hopefully never miss a glycolysis question after understanding it. At the very least, I'll be prying you away from purely rote memorizing it. At best, I'll be giving you an \"A-ha\" moment! \\[I pray I didn't make any mistakes. 🙏 😭 If I did, please tell me! If this was helpful, lmk down below!\\] I would love this to be all-in-one (or last-stop shop) type of post for the MCAT glycolysis pathway (so if you see something I've missed, please add it below)!

    "body": "One thing I learned being raised by women who had lived through both the depression and WW2 is how to \"scratch\" cook and make the cheapest ingredients into filling meals with little waste. \n\nI didn't realize how poor we were because I was always fed. We never went to bed hungry. Thinking about it, I realized some things were staples in my childhood diet. And their are lessons to be learned from the past. \n\nWhole grains are our friends. Oatmeal, hominy, corn meal. \n\nFor example, cold breakfast cereal will give you around 30 servings for $10. And you need milk too. Increasing the cost per serving. And it really doesn't fill you up with a serving. \n\nFor that same $10 you can get 113 servings of oatmeal. It can be prepared with water and a small amount of milk to make it \"creamy\" condensed and powdered milk work well too. \n\nMy grandmother used to say it \"sticks to the ribs\"\nA serving of oatmeal contains 5g of protein, 2.5g of fat, 1.6mg Iron and 4g of dietary fiber.  \n\nBeans, peas, lentils are wonderful inexpensive and filling bases for meals. \n\nDon't throw out bones. \"A chicken in every pot\" was a campaign slogan during the \"great depression\" because a single chicken could provide protein for a family for the entire week. \nIt's not just the meat. Bones can be used to make broth that contains both fats and protein. \n\nPotatoes and other root vegetables are filling foods. One of my favorite meals growing up was a potato dish made by cooking potatoes in broth to form a stew with carrots and limabeans. A little bullion gave it more flavor. \n\nBaking is also a skill that helps. We had homemade biscuits with every meal. \n\nObviously the two road blocks to these things are skill and time. One thing I have learned is that developing cooking skills saves time. Learning how much can be done ahead, what stages to freeze things at for best results etc. \n\nHaving a really good soup to nuts cookbook is a great start. \n\nLearning how to work with shelf stable products like dried milk, condensed milk etc. It's a different flavor profile. Condensed soups are also great bases to add fat, salt and flavor to dishes, it's all about proportions. \n\nMy current stock up plan over the next 6 months is to fill my freezer/pantry with staples such as oats, barley, flour, dried milk, dried beans, canned goods, powdered eggs, fats/shortening, bullion, various types of sugar, dried fruit. Dried yeast can be frozen. Powdered citric acid is important for food preservation and a good source of vitamin C. \n\nStock up on shelf stable multivitamins. Whole food isn't \"fortified\" the way processed food is. While it's possible to get all we need from food, a limited diet is limited in the vitamins it provides. Keeping this in mind will help us stay healthy. \n\nHaving these staples on hand and properly stored will help stretch our food budgets so that we can focus on adding fresh vegetables when in season or additional proteins. They are also relatively inexpensive additions that can be purchased in small amounts weekly that will add to our prep without breaking the bank now.",

With a few spices you can make the most delicious, cheap meals. Plant Based Indian and The Korean Vegan are great starting points to cooking these cuisines. You can use the same recipes with meat or fish. \n\nI also make my own kimchi. It’s great for gut health, lasts forever and adds to any meal.

Cinnamon is a duel purpose spice as its both an anti-inflammatory AND helps level sugar levels.\\*\\* Try growing herbs for flavoring and herbal teas. Mind comes in a lot of varieties. Just plant it in a container to keep it contained. Rosemary, lemon balm and maybe a few other herbs can go a long ways. Use them to DIY flavored vinegar (I use apple cider vinegar.) All these things can make the beans, rice, lentils, oatmeal and grains more exciting.",

Once I was at work and the topic was food waste. I said nothing goes to waste at my house. Everyone looked at me like I was an alien. One man said he \"hates leftovers\" and his SAHM wife made a new dinner every day. I asked what she did with the leftovers? He said SHE THREW THEM AWAY EVERY NIGHT. I just about sh*t bricks.\n\n\nHe was always complaining about money...and this. I never complained about money (saver all my life) but husband and I both worked good jobs. Everytime we got a raise or bonus it went into savings. Once the boss wanted to know how everyone was using the bonus we got. People were buying all sorts of things, cars even and a couple of fancy vacays...I was the only one who said savings. He looked at me and said BORING! When the day came when they were laying us off I heard so many crying. Someone asked me what my plans were and I said, well I could retire (I was 48) but it felt too early even if I could afford it, so I planned to go to school and do something completely different. Everyone lost their sh*t at that. \n\nIt just fasinated me how people could buy new cars every 5 years (I bought used every 15+ years), buy big houses, send kids to private schools, etc. We never moved. We still live in the \"starter\" house (paid off early). Now I will say we have gone on fabulous vacations. But not 4-5 star hotels. Budget lodges and such. Sleep in our van. But we'd stay for 3-5 weeks and other folks just 4 days. Anyway, to each their own. I have had a good life and I am glad that by being careful with every penny we are actually much less stressed about money. Saved, invested and always careful. Nothing wrong with that.",

Majestic weeping willows draped in Spanish moss gave way to vacant lots, pricker bushes, and bare lawns where sun-bleached plastic toys slowly rotted behind chain-link fences.\n\nHis work took him to this side of town every so often and he always hated it. Hated the neglect, the smell of desperation that lingered over the poor souls that lived and died there. They’d do anything for a buck.\n\nTo make it worse, the heat and humidity were oppressive and the A/C in the old Imperial had conked out this morning. Sweat coursed down his forehead and soaked his armpits. A feeble, damp breeze coming in through the window did little to offset the brutal Southern summer heat.\n\nAs he rounded the corner of 137th, he spotted a bright yellow sign next to two large cardboard boxes. It was a small spot of brightness amidst the decay and squalor of the neighborhood. It read: *Leminaid – fresh sqeezed.* A girl, looking about 9, was seated behind the boxes, blonde pigtails shining in the sun. A pitcher of bright yellow liquid and a stack of Dixie cups sat on the makeshift table.\n\nHe guided the car over and got out. \n\n“Hey there, little miss. How’s business?” \n\n“Not too good, mister. You’re my *only* customer so far.” She said with a frown. On closer inspection, she seemed older than 9, but he had a hard time guessing her age.\n\n“Who’s to say I’m a customer?” he said, chiding her. \n\n“You ain’t gonna buy a lemonade?”\n\n“How much is it?” he asked her. \n\n“’tree fiddy,” she said with a smile. Her teeth were crooked and several were missing. The rest looked like they had never seen a dentist.\n\n“What? That’s a lot for some lemonade!”\n\n“Jes’ kiddin’ ya, mister. It’s only fitty cent. Ya want one? Please? I’m savin’ up for a puppy!”\n\n“Sure, little miss. I’ll take one – it’ll beat this damned heat. Oh, sorry – pardon my language.”\n\n“That’s OK,” she said, pouring him a cup. Ice cubes clacked in the pitcher and condensation ran down the sides of the clear plastic. “I heard it all. Bad language don’t shock me none.”\n\nShe handed him the cup. “It’s real good. I made it myself.”\n\nHe downed it in one thirsty gulp. The cold liquid felt good going down, and the heat of the day abated somewhat. He handed over a wrinkled dollar bill.\n\n“Thanks, little miss. Really beats the heat,” he said. “Well, I best – “ he stopped, a metallic aftertaste flooding his mouth. He felt the inside of his cheeks start to burn, his throat swell. He grasped at his collar.\n\n“Wha – what did you…” he said through choked breaths. The little girl, who no longer seemed like a little girl, smiled her graveyard smile again.\n\n“Oh, the lemonade is only fitty cent, mister. But the antidote costs a lot more.”",

He seemed to be disappointed in them. \n\n“While I am glad to see you have all attempted the task I set you, most of you have underwhelmed me. Either you missed some critical chemicals, ignored things such as preparation methods, or even in one case suggested that it would be more efficient to bring food from ones own homeworld. This is a terrible idea as several federation species consume food that is toxic to humans. Thus would be….disastrous for a diplomatic meeting.” The lecturer shook his head, causing a light ripple to occur down the membrane that held his form together.\n\n“On to the current lecture.” The lecturer said as he opened the first slide, the slide contained a collection of images, some of obvious things, bottles of liquid that was likely alcohol, a common human intoxicant. One that Corsk could actually also consume for similar effects, though lessened to some degree. Others were utterly obfuscated such as several separate piles of white powder.\n\n“Humanity are well known for their production of numerous intoxicants and drugs. Some legal in the federation under specific licences. For example.” The lecturer highlighted several in the top corner. The class nodded along, Humanity had introduced the widest range of intoxicants, drugs and other similar chemicals to the galactic community of any species that had entered it. \n\n“These, are caffeine, alcohol and sugar. These are permitted in the federation under specific licences and on specific planets or stations. For example, as several of you noted in your reports. Ordeen have an reaction to sugar, having evolved on a planet where sucrose density was very low Ordeen describe consuming anything with a high sugar density as an ‘intense pleasure rush’ though consuming too much can result in vomiting and hyperactivity as well as cardiac damage due to increased blood pressure and heart rate. These are the drugs that can be freely traded, but require licences to sell to the wider public. Generally most federation worlds don’t regulate them very heavily. Humans having carte blanche to  purchase them as they see fit. Humans consuming Caffeine almost on a daily basis and sugar being an almost necessity to their survival. While humans consider sugar a necessity due to its effect on Ordeen it has been deemed a ‘drug'’' he then moved on to another group, these ones outlined in a orange and black striped band. \n\n“These are the human intoxicants that require a licence to trade in federation space These range from herbs and other plant matter that is burnt and the smoke is inhaled. To several types of injected or inhaled substances.” he gestured at a specific one. “This is rosemary. A common human herb, it is used regularly in their cooking. For almost every other species within the federation, excluding two minor species , It is a mild relaxant and light hallucinogenic when smoked. An individual of adult age is capable of purchasing it from licenced vendors in small amounts for recreational use. Several artists of the past decade have attributed their work to copious use of this drug.” He then indicated another one in the same bracket. This time it was an indistinct substance, a bottle of an unknown liquid.\n\n“This is citric acid. A compound humanity uses to not only preserve food, but to create an extreme ‘bitter’ flavour within their foods. In most foods it is not present in any extreme volumes however when created artificially and consumed in large amounts the effect on Tricul and Scithian’s is described as ‘dulling.’ users often describe how colours become more muted and sounds seem muffled and far away. This is accompanied with a sense of relaxation and a loosening of the muscles. This is used for medical reasons but little else, as Ordeen and Corsk as well as most other Federation species describe consuming this substance as ‘a sharp, burning pain’ akin to having their tongue dissolved.” The lecture then moved on to the third of the four boxes. A box with a solid red outline.\n\n“These are substances that are only permitted to be transported through federation space by humans, for humans. With few exceptions. These mostly are things that the humans would consider food, or ‘mild intoxicants’ but for federation species they have a much more significant effect.” He indicated a green plant like substance. \n\n“This is cannabis a plant that humans smoke for its intoxicating qualities. It is considered an illegal drug for Federation species to own or attempt to distribute due to its extreme effects. Humans also use it as a painkiller.” The lecturer indicated another substance in the same category. \n\n“This is a complex stimulant cocktail used by humans, it is a combination of caffeine artificial adrenaline and several other stimulants, which are by human standards, very low strength. This is then either consumed in a powdered mixture with sugar, or dissolved in to water with flavouring. Human military forces call this substance ‘jump powder’ or ‘stinger’ due to the headache it causes after use. Humans use this when either extreme activity for prolonged periods is required or when sleep is not a viable option. This substance is limited even on human planets. Most federation species are allergic to one compound within it or another.” The lecturer indicated the fourth box, this one had a black and red striped boarder. \n\n“These substances are not permitted to be transported on federation worlds or offloaded on to federation stations. Either due to their posed danger, or due to effects they have on federation species. I will not be going through any of these. As part of your assignment is to download the copy of this slide, all of the substances are labeled, I would like all the substances described and their effects and reasons for them to be catorogized as they are described.” As the lecturer set that weeks task, He moved on to the next slide this contained a single image, a large, spiked fruit. \n\n“This, is a unique case of a food consumed by a species being designated a potential bioweapon threat by the federation. The chemicals in this fruit are unusual in the extreme. As you all know Humanity’s Cradle world is a death world, harsh, and unforgiving. So each plant and creature has developed unique and irregular defenses against being consumed or damaged. This plant in particular has developed several. First, the top fronds are hard and spiked, making grasping it difficult, second its skin is tough and spiked. However it is not for these reasons it has been banned from federation airspace and classified as a potential bio weapon. Rather within its flesh is an enzyme which breaks down the flesh of those that attempt to consume it. This plant is referred to as a Pineapple.” The lecturer moved on to the next slide, leaving the class in no small amount of shock. The next slide contained a collection of powders and dusts, seeming to be various shades of white, there was also a collection of injection ampoules. \n\n“These are drugs that humans have developed for themselves, to use on themselves for ‘recreational’ reasons, though most human colonies and stations have them outlawed due to either extreme addiction or lethal side effects. These are often considered class A contraband by The Federation.” The lecturer paused, and looked at the class. \n\n“You may be asking yourselves why, in a series of lectures on Diplomacy you are being lecutred on human food and intoxicants. The reason for this is that humans consider food, and certan intoxicants, such as Alcohol, critical to a diplomatic meeting. Most human diplomacy is conducted over a meal or at a event where small amounts of intoxicants are shared. It is critical you learn what intoxicants and foods are appropriate and what are not. For example, offering a light, alcoholic beverage is suitable, so long as it is not made of hops or grains. If it is, it is to be a far stronger alcohol, And it is only to be carbonated if it is made from pale grapes. Human diplomacy is very specific and intricate. Not only because of the individual rules and regulations that are overtly tied to it. Such as the regulations regarding chocolate and the correct labelling of the sugar content within for Ordeen diplomats. But subtle social rules, such as what drinks to serve and what order to consume food in.” The lecturer moved on to the next slide. This was an image of a plate with a pair of glasses next to it, several sets of cutlery and another plate to the side of it. \n\n“Here we see a typical human diplomatic dining set. You should note that the two glasses are for separate drinks, allowing the diner to chose between an alcoholic beverage and water. Sometimes both glasses are used. But rarely. The second thing to note is the multiple plates and sets of cutlery these are for different stages of the mean. As well as for different types of food. The side plate is for bread but little else. I expect by the end of the course you all to be familiarized with this set up and the several other set ups for dining that are culturally relevant to humans.”  The lecturer closed the slide show. \n\n“Due to the fact that interacting with humans in a diplomatic manner requires significant cultural knowledge and understanding of their interactions. Future lectures will focus on human tendencies and preferences, as well as what you can, and cannot do around them. That is all, I hope to see you all in the next lecture.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-------------\n\n*Sorry this series is a little slower than the last one. its a bit harder to write, You'll likely see more one-shot stuff from me between it. I'm working on a one shot in-universe, Exploring the Dune Chip further and The potential for what it could mean for waging war.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n<[Previous](https://reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/jcwfie/lessons_on_diplomacy_with_humans_lecture_1_food/)",

    "body": "I’m super angry and disappointed right now. I’ve been using the Créme De Menthe mouthwash tabs for a good long while now, and I loved it, I really did! It’s compact and perfect for travel and onthe go, but I’ve come to find that convenience comes at an awful price.\n\nI went to my dentist today for a routine cleaning and x-rays, and the dentist found that several of my fillings are damaged and one tooth in particular will actually need a crown now because they can’t put anymore filling in it. According to my dentist, this type of damage is primarily caused by repeated exposure to acid. Mind you I NEVER drink soda, energy drinks, or anything else that would have enough acid to do that kind of damage.\n\nAfter thinking for a moment, I realized the only other thing I used on my mouth were these mouth wash tabs, and thankfully I had them in my bag so I pulled them out and showed them to my dentist. He took a look at them, and it turns out these contain citric acid, something that is absolutely TERRIBLE for your teeth and honestly has no business being in ANY product that goes into your mouth.\n\nI’m horrified that I’ve damaged my teeth to such a degree without even realizing it, assuming insurance covers the crown it’s going to cost me at MINIMUM $750 to fix what they’re concerned about right now, and there could be more fillings I have to fix later because of this.\n\nObviously I trashed the tabs as soon as I got home and I’ll NEVER be using them again. But I’m still so upset and angry. I just can’t get over the fact that LUSH would sell something that can damage such an important part of your body. I’ll never be buying any oral products from LUSH again, and I STRONGLY advise everyone to take my story as a cautionary tale and avoid using any of their oral hygiene products too.",

        "body": "OP, I’m sorry you’re going through this. But I’m going to be frank with you, I don’t think it’s necessarily the citric acid or the mouthwash tabs in general that caused the damage. Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) is listed as the second ingredient and citric acid is the 4th. The two form a chemical reaction once the tabs get wet and the resulting solution is pH neutral. Your dentist probably didn’t notice the sodium bicarbonate in the ingredients. Without knowing everything you’ve put in your mouth and your behaviors that might affect your fillings, it’s not accurate to say with certainty that the tabs are the cause.  \n\nYou can buy pH test strips for very cheap and test the mouthwash tabs if you are curious, but I doubt a company that’s been in business as long as Lush has would create a low pH mouthwash. Lush’s creators have extensive knowledge of cosmetic chemistry so, again, I would bet a lot of money they wouldn’t make an oral health product that’s acidic.  \n\nFor those who are bashing the anti-fluoride oral products, most mouthwashes don’t contain fluoride. Also, in the U.S., Lush is not legally allowed to sell fluoride-containing products because it’s considered a drug here and they would need to pay a lot of money for testing and applications for the FDA to allow them to do so. It’s not worth it for them. This is the same reason why they don’t sell sunscreen in the U.S.",

Citric acid is commonly added to all kinds of things as a preservative and/or flavouring. It's not just fizzy drinks and energy drinks. So it seems difficult to me to blame the mouthwash for the acid.\n\nAlso, the mouthwash tabs are mostly bicarbonate of soda. When they get wet the bicarb and citric acid undergo a chemical reaction resulting in a ph around neutral. The reaction is what makes the gentle fizzy feeling when you crunch up the toothpaste tab.

Your digestion is a little more robust than that, but if something smells funny or off then don’t eat or drink it. And if you’re unsure of something only have a few sips or nibbles of it. In an emergency you can eat something fairly foul without too much of a side effect, but making a habit of that will lead to serious health concerns, a large amount of your digestion is now based on the idea of filtering out toxins and poisons. They’ll save you from a lot but they need time to rest and purify themselves for the next round.” Modan explains to Falala as The Officer emerges from the cafe with Theresa86 in tow.\n\n“But the thing I drank was sour and it was good!” Falala protests.\n\n“Yes, sour can be an amazing flavour. In the wild it generally means that what you’re eating is very safe as little else will be eating it, as it’s digestible acid. Usually citric and therefore very clean food. Heck, a lot of cleaning products use citric acid.” Modan explains.\n\n“I drank a cleaning product?!” Falala exclaims in shock.\n\n“No you drank an energy drink. Water is a cleaning product, so is air if used properly, but you have no problem ingesting either of those now do you?” Modan asks in a tone that suggests she’s being very, very silly.\n\n“Hey is that M&M?” Someone calls out and he turns and sees one of the trawlers walking over. All the stupid little cults and conspiracies on the planet were more than ninety nine percent harmless or pointless, but the rare one percent were reason enough to have multiple teams of men just wandering through the city and catching whatever scraps of weird information gets thrown at them. He waves at them and the three men wander over. One of them outright catching a data chip literally thrown at them. Modan has no idea what it is about these men that has people utterly convinced they’re message runners, but whatever it is they have it and Modan doesn’t.\n\n“What’s this?” He asks. Modan is mentally kicking himself as he only recognizes these men from his time in Cruel Space and when he came across them on janitorial duties, begging for more to do. He hadn’t gotten their names then and regretted it now.\n\n“Side effects of the Lakran silliness.” Modan remarks not exactly believing it himself. He still wants people that are closer to experts on the subject actually confirming it. “This young lady now has a nearly human digestive tract and decided that meant human food was on the menu. She started with an energy drink.”\n\n“Caffeine high?” The patrol asks and Modan nods. “Geeze... well at least it wasn’t a sugar high M&M she might have started licking you.”\n\n“... That’s the worst pun on my nickname I’ve heard in a while.” Modan notes dryly and the man shrugs.\n\n“M&M?” Falala asks even as The Officer stops right next to the group.\n\n“Miss... I cannot actually pronounce this name. Miss Urthani, Theresa86 has declined to press charges for the damage to her property and the disruption of her business. I have received no reports of any further damages to property or persons and unless Quartermaster Maji here would like to press charges.”\n\n“No.” Maji states.\n\n“Then you are free to go. Your family has been contacted and will be here shortly. I suggest avoiding flying between the spires at traffic level.” The Officer states. “Now, are there any other considerations or concerns?”\n\n“No officer. Thank you for your time and patience.” Modan says and she nods, gives a long, evaluating, clearly undressing them in her mind look to him and the other men and then heads back to her cruiser.\n\n“Does... does everyone look at you like that?” Falala asks in shock.\n\n“Okay, just how recently did you come out of your cocoon?” The unofficial head of the trawling group asks and Modan can’t help but nod to the question.\n\n“... This week?” She asks.\n\n“In the last seventy two hours perchance?”\n\n“Uhm... What time is it?”\n\n“An hour past midday.”\n\n“Fifty hours ago? Give or take some minutes?”\n\n“And you’ve already been nearly arrested!? Damn! Good job kid! That takes some get up and go!”\n\n“Don’t encourage this!” Modan snaps at him.\n\n“Hey I’m just saying! It takes a lot spunk to get damn near arrested mere days after puberty gives you a solid kick to the can!”\n\n“Do not encourage lawbreaking!” The Officer shouts back even as she gets into her cruiser.\n\n“Shit she can hear us?” One of the Trawlers asks.\n\n“Yes I can hear you! At least wait until the officers have left before you start congratulating people for potentially criminal behaviour!” She calls back to them before slamming the door of the cruiser and finally taking off.\n\n“Well now that she’s gone: Congratulations on your potentially criminal behaviour!” The ‘leader’ of the trawling team exclaims and Modan groans in frustration as he pinches the bridge of his nose and Falala just looks confused.\n\n“Is this a normal human interaction?” Theresa86 asks.\n\n“Oh this is tame.” Modan remarks before suddenly moving and having the leader of the trawler team in a headlock. “Stop being a bad influence you cretin!”\n\n“Oh! Hey! Knock it off!” The man shouts as he flails for a moment before punching Modan in the gut. Modan just stabilizes himself and starts rubbing his knuckles into the other man’s scalp interspersed with a few knocks on the top of his head.\n\n“Stop being a bad influence! Now get back to work you cretin!” Modan says letting the man go and giving him a shove that sends him staggering.\n\n“You know I’m getting you back later right?”\n\n“Looking forward to it! Now get!” Modan orders and with some laughter, and apparently no less than two different organizations mistaking them for couriers, the trawling crew leaves.\n\n“Alright then. How about we head inside, we get Falala here something to settle her a bit more and wait for her family? After all, we’ve spent some time in Theresa86’s cafe, it would be rude not to make a purchase.” Modan offers.\n\n“Oh I knew I like, liked you for a reason.” Theresa86 gushes.\n\n“Think he’ll be that good when he’s totally a dad?” Mara asks.\n\n“Like even better.” May replies.\n\n“I don’t get it, why is this so... I mean, why aren’t you angry or trying to press charges or getting upset with me?”\n\n“You’re young and clearly didn’t want to actually hurt anyone?” Jadza asks.\n\n“It’s like totally hard to be angry at a girl you met when she introduced herself face first to your totally reinforced windows?” Theresa86 adds.\n\n“It’s the right thing to do.” Modan finishes up.\n\n“But I... I tried to eat you. I shot my proboscis at you, that’s only for eating!”\n\n“Kiddo, in this galaxy a man just has to be comfortable with the idea of being edible, one way or the other.” Modan says with thinly veiled amusement.\n\n“Wait like what? You have to what?” Falala asks and Modan chuckles.\n\n“Oh, innocent children. Too easy. Far too easy.” He says fondly.\n\n“I’m not a child! I’m fully developed! I left my cocoon and everything!” Falala protests.\n\n“It takes another three more years for an Urthani to fully develop after leaving the cocoon.” Eve replies even as she opens the door to Theresa86’s cafe ahead of them.\n\n“So a teenager then. I was one once, it’s not the end of the world. Theresa86, I think our young friend here needs a sampler platter. Something to test her newly changed pallet. With plenty of water on the side to clear her mouth and hydrate, her new physiology needs a lot of water. Which can make a caffeine rush worse if you’re not properly hydrated.”\n\n“Certainly, and you?”\n\n“Actually make it two sampler platters, a bigger one for me. I don’t know what half the things on the menu are. Jadza? Eve? May? Mara? I’m willing to cover the cost of everything.”\n\n“No that’s not appropriate we should cover it and...” Jadza begins\n\n“I’m the one bringing an extra person in. So I should pay.” Modan replies.\n\n“But, you like totally don’t have to! Like honestly!” Eve says and Modan shakes his head.\n\n“We can totally cover it! It’s like so adorable that you wanna help a young lady like that! Real Paternal instincts!” Mara protests.\n\n“I’m going to leave enough money to pay for all of us on the counter with a tip when we leave. So it can either be for the meal, or it can just be an extra large tip for Theresa86.” Modan cuts off\n\n“But that’s like... why are you totally insisting on this?” May asks.\n\n“Cultural reasons. I’m a provider. It’s baked in.”\n\n“So you’re showing off a womanly side?” Falala asks incredulously and Modan gives her a baffled look before sighing. He doesn’t miss the fact that Theresa86 is struggling not to laugh in amusement. Whoever wins this argument she wins as well.\n\n“These are masculine traits back home.”\n\n“Yes well, you’re like from the place where all light, life and sense goes to die. I totally suppose it like makes sense that you’ll have things backwards.” Eve says.\n\n“Well it’s certainly exotic. A man that wants to keep pace in all aspects? That wants to sweep you up off your feet in stead of the other way around? Have it all instinctual?” Jadza asks before letting out a strange but alluring sound. Like a human impersonating a cat.\n\n“How did you not get that impression already? You’ve seen me spar. All of you have seen me spar.”\n\n“I haven’t.” Falala pipes up.\n\n“Except the kid. You all know that I’m deadly in a fight.”\n\n“I didn’t.” Falala adds and Modan slowly turns to give her an incredulous look even as everyone else shakes with suppressed laughter. He turns back to the rest.\n\n“What I’m saying is that this shouldn’t be a surprise. I’m a trained soldier! A member of an army! With responsibilities and wages and training and duties and squads! I’m perfectly capable of paying, of being responsible and more.”\n\n“But it’s like one thing to be a totally hot male warrior from the savage stars of Cruel Space. There’s been like all kinds of movies about how totally hot that would be. But even the men in those movies are more masculine men and not just women in steaming hot man meat.” Eve explains and then considers. “That was a totally bad way of explaining that. Galactic Trade is like so limited as a language.”\n\n“I get it anyways, the idea of a Cruel Space man is more attractive than an actual Cruel Space man is it?” He asks with a teasing grin.\n\n“NO that’s like, not what I was trying to say and...”\n\n“I still haven’t gotten your orders yet. I can like, get started now if you like. But...” Theresa86 interrupts the bit of confusion as Falala decides it wouldn’t be rude to sit down and ignore the scratch marks on the counter.\n\nThey make their orders and the miniature debate as to who should pay gets passed around again. Modan insists he’s going to leave the full payment and tip on the counter and the girls insist that they can pay. Theresa86 encourages all of them and gives Falala a look that promptly makes the girl look away when she suggests no one pay.\n\n“I was just putting the option out. I don’t think anyone’s going to take it.” Falala defends herself as she seems to grow even more comfortable.\n\nBy the time the food arrives and just as it’s set down in front of them, another Urthani rushes through the doors.\n\n“Falala (A short chirp in Trill-Speech) Are you alright?” The new Urthani asks as her antenna twitch every which way as she huffs and pants. She seems to shrink into herself as the cafe turns to regard her and then she flutters forward a bit. “Are you alright? Are you hurt? I knew it was a mistake to get you that stuff, the scanner said it was safe but how can anything that was invented by monsters from beyond the black be safe?”\n\n“I’m fairly certain I should be offended by that.” Modan notes dryly and the older Urthani lets out a squeak of fright and tries to flutter back with Falala in her arms. But Falala has a grip of the base of the stool with her claws and as the stool is riveted into the floor she’s not going anywhere.\n\n“You! You’re... you’re a human!” The Urthani exclaims.\n\n“Mom. This is... Modan right?”\n\n“That’s right. Modan of the Maji family. Or Modan Maji. I’m a Quartermaster on The Dauntless and a fully sworn in soldier of The Undaunted.”\n\n“You... your poison made my daughter go insane!” The older Urthani accuses him.\n\n“Mom I’m fine!” Falala insists.\n\n“Madam, if you would please calm down. I’m fully willing to explain the situation to the best of my knowledge, although I am rather curious as to where you got the energy drink for your daughter to begin with.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/nfsakq/out_of_cruel_space_part_1/) [Last](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/12tebzx/out_of_cruel_space_part_658/) [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/12viohm/out_of_cruel_space_part_660/)",

Dave hasn't eaten anything from that database in a week. Oh right, Gfferedc insists that we refer to him as “human”, or if there are multiple humans involved “the onboard human”, but this is MY personal log. Even without Dave eating anything from his database(or menu as he calls it) it is the most used database in the NSD by far.\n\nThe popularity of human food is partially due to the fact that the database is more than 30% larger than the default database. Yeah, even with nonstop fab, we wouldn't be able to produce one of everything on there before we arrive at Fredalt Station. Humans state that they are omnivores, and that an omnivore is a creature than can withstand the diets of both a carnivore and a herbivore. I feel that a small note should be added to that statement. They also seem to be able to survive when consuming garbage. I say this because when “Twinkies” were ordered on the NSD it requested materials that only the fabrication facilities(currently under repair) could produce.\n\nSeveral parts of the human database have had to be restricted from the crew. For instance the majority of the “Indian” section has been password protected. These foods contain a large quantity of a chemical Dave calls “capsaicin”. This chemical is highly addictive and has hallucinogenic properties. Speaking of weird chemicals in human cuisine, the cleaning staff has discovered that the drink known as “Lemon Juice Concentrate” contains \\[citric acid\\] and is a great scale cleaning compound. It also makes you smell really good.\n\nI suppose its good that Dave can eat almost anything. Because he has been. Going through the request logs, he has ordered food designed for 14 different species so far. He seems to have a preference for foods high in sugars, fats, and salt with occasional high protein meals. These eating habit does not match the human nutritional requirement information I have been given. Since I have gotten confirmation of the accuracy of this data I will correct his diet tomorrow.\n\nSigning off for now, think I'm coming down with something...\n\n[\\[Next\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/cyvnw1/human_onboard_diet/)",

What part of *omni*vore are you not understanding?\n\nThe list of things humans can eat an be abbreviated as \"Yes. Eventually.\" Might have to dissolve it in acid or feed it to something else first, but if you show us something and say it's inedible we don't take that as a warning, we take it as a challenge.\n\nI'm not even talking about a HFY perspective here. How many of our foods are toxic if not prepared properly? How many foods require at *least* two steps of processing before they're edible at all? How many things do we eat that are completely toxic to other animals? Heck, name anything organic that we don't have *some* way of refining into something edible. It's a short list.",

Just to take my meds with/after a full meal and plenty of water etc. \n\nWhile I’ve been a lifelong exerciser, I always did so for enjoyment and never any kinda goal. So last year when I started resistance training more seriously for weight gain/muscle gain, I realized fast that I needed to reevaluate what I ate, as I wasn’t eating to match my activity level/needed more of the right foods.  \n\nAlso- took me a LOOOOOONG time to be consistent with it- I experience habit relapse often! \n\nBut based on my height/weight/activity level/goal, I eventually was eating 130-140g of protein a day and *holy shit do my meds work so much better* \n\nI originally thought it had to do with my cycle (I also have PMDD :,) ) like I was just feeling better cause I was done ovulating. But It kinda became the new norm for the past couple of months. Within the past few weeks I’ve seen a lot of TikTok’s about ADHD medication and high protein diets. Coincidence? Placebo? I genuinely feel a difference in the quality of my focus on days that I hit my protein goal versus days that I don’t. Before I saw the posts and made a correlation I genuinely thought the days my focus was worse, just had to do with my cycle. \n\nI’m not advocating for anyone to just randomly change their diet- obviously you need to talk to a doctor or a dietitian about something like that. Even if we all have adhd we are all different genetically, but I still wanted to share my experience.  \n\n",

On the third day, I went to make my morning cup of coffee and realized I had no desire to have it, so I just put my mug away. It was so bizarre! I felt amazing eating that much protein, so I looked into it. To put it in a simplified way, certain amino acids are used to synthesize neurotransmitters and amino acids are the building blocks of protein. An example is tryptophan and serotonin. If you don't get enough tryptophan in your diet, you may end up depressed because your serotonin levels will fall. All of this is a over-simplification, but just google \"neurotransmitters are made from amino acids,\" and you'll get a ton of studies back. Our friend, dopamine comes from a chain reaction that starts with phenylalanine and goes through several other amino acids before dopamine is synthesized. If you eat enough protein, the amount which will vary from person to person, you will have more dopamine in your brain. And, it's not that hard to do when you have meals worked out. I've been struggling to get back to it, because I developed alpha-gal syndrome, but it's SO worth it and this is a great reminder to make the effort. Thanks so much for posting about it.",

    "body": "&#x200B;\n\nWant to know what really opened up my eyes to how food companies exploit us? I spent years investigating the differences between European and American food products, and what I found, disgusted me. \n\nA college buddy of mine decided to go live in London for a few years. While she was there, I often had her go to Tesco and other European grocery stores to take pictures of the ingredient lists for me and send me boxes of products. I’d compare them with the same brand of American products side-by-side and saw completely different ingredient lists.\n\nCompanies like Kraft-Heinz, Kellogg’s, PepsiCo, and Quaker sell safer, better products oversees while making inferior versions to sell to Americans. The evidence of this runs the gamut from fast food places to boxed cake mix to cereal to candy and even oatmeal— you can’t escape it. This is what set me down the path of advocating for change in the food system and I’ve never looked back. \n\nHere are 6 American products that are completely different overseas…\n\n1. McDonald’s French Fries\n\nLet’s start with McDonald’s French Fries. They make their iconic french fries in the U.K. with a few simple ingredients: potatoes, oil, dextrose, salt—but in the U.S they’re made with “natural beef flavor” and sodium acid pyrophosphate, and are fried in oil laced with the anti-foaming agent dimethylpolysiloxane – the main ingredient in silly putty (1). \n\nThey’ve somehow figured out how to cook their fries without all these extra ingredients overseas, so why not here?\n\n2. Quaker Instant Oatmeal Packets\n\nDid you know Quaker Oats Strawberries & Cream has ZERO strawberries? In the U.S. Quaker mimics the look and taste of real strawberries by using “Flavored and Colored Fruit Pieces” comprised of dehydrated apples, artificial strawberry flavor, citric acid, and the artificial dye Red 40. It’s a total scam!\n\nMeanwhile in the U.K. Quaker doesn’t even attempt to sell that garbage and doesn’t make any products like this. The closest counterpart they have is a product called “Oat So Simple” that has REAL strawberries in it—light years ahead of the popular U.S. version made with artificial dyes and artificial flavors.\n\n3. Mountain Dew\n\nPick up a bottle of Mountain Dew in the U.K. and you’ll find that it gets its bright yellow color simply from beta carotene (a natural color derived from carrots and other plants). Meanwhile, PepsiCo sells a very different version of Mountain Dew in America. Here in the States, instead of using natural colors to give it a tantalizing look, Mountain Dew is artificially colored with a petroleum-based dye called Yellow #5. Although artificial dyes are common in America, that doesn’t make them okay to eat. They’ve been linked to several health issues and may be contaminated with carcinogens (2). They certainly are not as safe as beta carotene. And it gets worse…\n\nThe U.S. version of Mountain Dew contains brominated vegetable oil (BVO) – which is an ingredient BANNED in Europe (3). Way back in 2014, PepsiCo announced they would remove BVO from all of their American drinks following a successful petition by activist Sarah Kavanagh (4). But they still have not removed BVO from Mountain Dew, nearly 5 years later. Meanwhile, they continue to sell BVO-free Mountain Dew in other countries.\n\n4. Heinz Ketchup\n\nYou know what you’ll find in almost every restaurant in America? Heinz Tomato Ketchup. Heinz ketchup is GMO-free in the U.K. (5) but full of GMOs and High Fructose Corn Syrup in the U.S., along with lab-produced “natural flavoring” that helps create an addiction to their product (6). Think of this next time you’re dipping your fries in and can’t stop! While Heinz makes a “Simply Heinz” version of ketchup in the U.S. (still with natural flavors but a cleaner ingredient list), why don’t they just make this their regular ketchup? There is no need for the heavily processed version that you’ll find in most restaurants and homes in America.\n\n5. Doritos\n\nBoth versions of Doritos are horrible, but American Doritos are covered in artificial dyes made from petroleum (Red #40, Blue #1, and Yellow #5). These dyes have been found to be contaminated with carcinogens, such as benzidine (2) In the U.K., these dyes require a warning label that says “May Have an Adverse Effect on Activity and Attention in Children” (7). No one wants to put that on their product! That’s why they don’t use artificial dyes in Doritos overseas and instead color Doritos more simply with paprika extract and annatto. The Doritos in the U.K. are also non-GMO, while the American versions are made with GMO corn contaminated with glyphosate weed killer (😎.\n\n6. Kellogg’s Frosted Flakes Cereal\n\nAt first glance the ingredients in Frosted Flakes in the U.S. and U.K. look nearly identical. The main difference is the addition of the preservative BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) in the U.S. version. Controversial research links BHT to cancer (9) and it’s believed to be an endocrine disruptor that interferes with your hormones (10) BHT isn’t permitted in cereals in Europe, so Kellogg’s reformulated their cereals to sell them legally overseas. Following our 2015 petition to get BHT out of American cereal (11) Kellogg’s removed BHT from several brands (like Rice Krispies), but still use it 4 years later in Frosted Flakes despite selling it BHT-free in the U.K. \n\nWhy don’t these companies just sell the same, safer, products everywhere?\n\nI’ll tell you why. \n\nEurope takes a “precautionary principle” approach towards food additives that are potentially risky. They ban or add warning labels to these additives for their citizens. The U.S. takes the opposite approach. It does not remove additives from our food supply until they have been proven dangerous – which can take a very long time and a lot of red tape. This means Americans are literally the lab rats.\n\nThe U.S. government allows food companies to largely police itself, deciding which ingredients, chemicals, and additives are “safe” to use in their products (12). \n\nThis clearly isn’t a wise approach – is it?\n\nIf a company can get away with using cheaper ingredients, they will. Given a choice, they’ll always opt for the cheaper flavor enhancer, and the cheaper color additive, and the cheaper preservative, and the cheaper GMO ingredient, even if these cheaper alternatives have a negative impact on our health.\n\nThe truth is that nobody is watching out for us. When they tell you they know their processed foods are safe, they are telling you a lie.\n\nI dedicated an entire chapter in my latest book, Feeding You Lies, to this subject because there is so much more you need to know! The food industry doesn’t care about your health, so you really need to. It is now available in bookstores everywhere.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n4ozf4jupqg91.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&s=9de969d239e0d3d1ba80d2d2906d44a0f66c4cb9\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sdbj83lxpqg91.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=35f01d81f62a54817acc8fb8d45a7bff270c49ca\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cx6fdql6qqg91.png?width=708&format=png&auto=webp&s=0181debc45624c0e7637435a3e2a1dbad073d20a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0la2c27bqqg91.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&s=fad62bee438a580b1a70ae96dac76946203a2709",

I was getting beer. Good deals.\n\nBut just about everything everywhere was processed or pre-made/frozen food or cheap meat. No vegetables. And you know why? Because the people who eat vegetables go to a real outlet and then they buy their meat there. \n\nIt is an economical trap and a trick. If you gave up your junk food and spent *more time* on making food, you can eat better.\n\nBut as always the convenience creates atrophy in these skills, and the pressure of keeping going dissuades people. Its understandable and I get, but if you do a price to price analysis and factor in some time, as a whole, this populace could starve out shit food, make it so it never hits the shelves.",

American food, especially processed food, is much saltier than British food. There are jokes about how “bland” British food is.\n\nI noticed that Fanta orange soda is a different (brighter more toxic looking) shade of orange in the USA compared to England too.\n\nPortion sizes at restaurants and fast food drive thrus are MUCH bigger in the USA. A small shake in USA is easily a large in UK. The party-size bags of chips are much bigger in the USA. Soda and popcorn sizes at movie theaters are WAY bigger in the USA. \n\nPeople expect to have leftovers when they eat out in the USA and often ask for boxes to take leftovers home because the portions are so huge. In the UK most people finish their smaller portioned meals and rarely ask for a “doggy bag”\n\nI think it really is a matter of what you’re used to. If you’re used to saltier food and bigger portions, because it’s always been that way in your culture then it will seem normal. It’s only when you go elsewhere you realize",

He dyed a super low immersion method with a Camouflage green background at 1.5%, then speckled in pistachio, tobacco leaf and blazing orange, sprayed with citric acid water and then over-speckled silver grey to mute the colors.\n\nHe found the eyes on Etsy and the glow in the dark dinosaur fleece lining at Joanne's.\nI am absolutely *not* a seamstress but I did my best after watching a YouTube tutorial and used Coats and Clark glow in the dark thread to whipstitch the fleece to the back.\n\nObviously, the real life dragon has black eyes and a white tongue but I went with green eyes and a red tongue so it would clearly look more \"lizardy\".\n\nIt was a true labor of love to co-create this dream scarf with my son and I hope he comes up with another fun idea soon to tackle together.

    "body": "TL;DR- Binge culture ruined my life and my health, and is ruining the lives of my entire community, but no one is talking about it\n\nBinge culture ruined my life. I was born and raised in Texas and I can’t speak for anywhere else but I know that here and in a lot of the USA southern states, bigger is better. That means bigger food portions, bigger clothing sizes, bigger seating, bigger drinks, everything is catered towards larger sizes. I hear about “diet culture” a lot but down here where I live it really doesn’t exist, maybe for certain communities, but for the most part people here revel in constantly binge eating foods that are extremely rich, sickeningly sweet, oily, cheese smothered, hot & spicy, and eating massive portions of them. It is very difficult to find foods that are low in calorie or even any type of specialty food for people with medical conditions or food allergies. Vegans are openly ridiculed and bullied for not eating meat, to the point where even products that are somewhat associated with veganism are openly derided by our STATE LEGISLATORS (see: Ted Cruz’s rant against tofu and soy products, which was extremely ironic considering Texas is one of the largest producers of soy in the entire USA). Gluten free products might take up half a shelf at the grocery store, while there are literally two full aisles just for sodas. When I started at my job, they didn’t have a uniform in my size, but they had plenty of L-3XL uniforms. I had to size up to a medium and it was the only medium they had left. Literally Everyone I know eats out at restaurants or takeout 3-4 times per week, sometimes every single day for lunch, and this is accepted as normal. People who bring their own lunches in to work are seen as weird, even if they can’t afford to eat out with their higher paid colleagues. My friends and coworkers are constantly complaining about their health effects caused by being overweight, but they don’t want to change how/what they eat and they laugh and joke about their previous heart attacks or diagnoses of diabetes as if it’s no big deal. Heart disease is the #1 killer in Texas even though it is highly preventable. The culture has been this way since I was a child.\n\nThis is the culture that gave me an eating disorder, not diet culture. A binge culture telling me that bigger is better, that eating 2 full sized portions meant to feed 2 people can and should be eaten just by me, in one sitting, and that that is “treating myself”. A capitalist culture telling me to buy and consume as much as possible, because that will make me happy. A culture blasting advertisements in my eyes and ears everywhere I look, telling me this new food product is what is going to make me happy, even if it’s just for a few minutes. A culture that has normalized eating 3 servings of ice cream in one sitting as a way to ‘help’ you when you are sad. A culture that has massive potlucks at church every Sunday and has normalized the sensation of eating 3 full plates or more until you are uncomfortably full, even to the point of damaging your stomach. This is binge culture. This is normal in my community, and it’s devastating it. \n\nBinge culture is just as insidious as diet culture, even more so in fact, because the binge culture is supported and subsidized by the massive corn industry(which is in EVERYTHING- corn syrup, corn starch, even things like citric acid, that’s from corn too!), the 528 billion dollar fast food industry, the \\~200 billion dollar soda industry, and the \\~105 billion dollar chocolate industry (which relies heavily on CHILD SLAVERY! See Nestles 2014 labor report in West Africa). Compare that to the \\~72 billion dollar diet industry (and that’s generous) and tell me which culture is more influential. Here in Texas the winner is clear. The only reason diet culture even exists in the first place is because of these highly influential and powerful food industries that have messed up the way that people are meant to intuitively eat, which is not possible in an artificial environment where people are constantly bombarded with food and images of food that are artificially engineered to be hyper palatable, visually pleasing, unsatiating, physically addicting, and constantly available wherever you go. THIS is why I developed BED. Not because of diet culture, but because binge culture is so accepted and normalized where I live that it is seen as the norm. I know this sub caters more towards restrictive eating disorders, but BED is just as valid of a disorder as AN, and us folks struggling with BED deserve to be heard. I struggle with extremely disordered binge eating, but I don’t feel like I can find support among some of these subs because they often facilitate the binge culture mindset and trigger me into bingeing. Sentiments like “restriction always leads to a binge” make my mind say “well you might as well just binge and not even try because any form of self control = restriction I guess”. Sentiments like “if you refuse any food offered to you at all that is restriction and that is a Disordered Mindset” being touted as ‘recovery progress’, when for me, the inability to refuse food is a hallmark of the BED mindset. This is not helpful to me and other BED sufferers and is actually enabling my form of eating disorder, which is ironic for a sub that claims to be for only pro-recovery. I just wish I could find the support of like minded people who have suffered the way I have because of the way we were raised.",

Used to hate church but I always got donuts after the service was over and as a kid it was the “oh take two or three kids love donuts!”. It’s insane how much the culture here is focused on food and just eating constantly. And like you said- don’t you dare make it vegetarian or god forbid you make it vegan (like anyone here even knows the difference)",

    "body": "MY NEW VERSION OF THIS PROCESS IS LOCATED HERE: https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/avme9u/how_to_make_salt_and_vinegar_seasoning_updated/\n\nI am a huge fan of salt and vinegar chips. It has been my favorite go to snack every sense I was a kid. But yet I always wondered how the seasoning was made so when I dug down and did a little research I found out how industry produces the seasoning and modified the process to replicate at home. This seasoning produced in this recipe is very vinegary and worth the time involved making it!\n\nBefore we get started I just want to make clear that this process is still experimental and I am still playing around with it. Once I figure out a better way of producing it I will post it. \n\nSo to start we all know the main chemical used as the flavoring agent in Salt and Vinegar seasoning is Sodium Diacetate and industrially it is made by combing Sodium Hydroxide (Lye) with Glacial Acetic Acid (99% Pure Vinegar) to form Sodium Acetate. Then more Glacial Acidic acid is added to lock in the acidic flavor and convert the chemical over to Sodium Diacetate.\n\nBut for my process we will be using Vinegar instead of Glacial Acetic Acid, Baking Soda instead of Lye, and Citric Acid in replacement of the acetic acid. The addition of the citric acid will be explained later in the recipe.\n\nThis home version (in theory) produces Sodium Diacetate along with a small amount of Sodium Citrate without using dangerous industrial chemicals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**HOW MAKE SALT AND VINEGAR SEASONING**\n\n1. Add **2.4L** of White Distilled Vinegar to a large pot.\n2. Add **100g** of Baking Soda to the vinegar **IN SMALL AMOUNTS!** After the solution has finished bubbling, heat the solution to 160F for 1 hour to ensure the reaction has completed.\n3. Evaporate the solution by boiling it down to about **1/10** of its original volume (or more) until you see crystals start to form at the top of the liquid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***NOTE:*** *During the evaporation process you will begin to see crystals forming on the side of the pot as well. Collect a small portion of these from the pot and set them aside to use as seed crystals for the crystallization process.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*4.* After boiling down the liquid transfer it to a clean beaker and cool the liquid in an ice bath. When the solution has cooled down to room temperature take a seed crystal and drop it into the solution. (You should immediately see the liquid start to crystallize).\n\n5. Transfer the newly formed Sodium Acetate crystals to some coffee filters and Allow it to dry. After drying the Sodium Acetate grind it into a fine powder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***This recipe can be scaled up or down to meet requirements.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***(PART 2)*** **Making Salt and Vinegar Seasoning:**\n\n1. Add **140g** of Sodium Acetate to a beaker.\n2. Add **21g** of Sea Salt to the mixture along with **12g** of Corn Starch and combine well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***NOTE:*** *The Corn Starch is added to prevent the seasoning from clumping after drying.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Next add **24-27g** of Citric Acid ***(This step converts (some) of the sodium acetate back to acetic acid)***. Stir the powders until the powder starts to clump up and becomes a wet slimy paste.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***NOTE:*** *The powder will clump together and become wet due to acetic acid forming thus combining with the left over unconverted sodium acetate. The powder is now comprised of both Sodium Acetate and Acetic Acid and possibly a little harmless sodium citrate. Which in theory is our desired sodium diacetate product. I have come up with this hypothesis because sodium diacetate is a combination of sodium acetate and acetic acid which is just what we have created.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. Transfer the wet powder to a coffee filter and allow it to dry. Then grind the seasoning into a fine powder.\n\n5. Place the seasoning inside a clean container with a lid and store in a cool dry place and enjoy!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***This recipe can be scaled up or down to meet requirements.***",

It looks to me like you'd get a mix of mostly sodium diacetate with some sodium acetate in your initial reaction.  Adding the sea salt and corn starch aren't relevant to the reaction.  Adding the citric acid won't participate in the reaction either since the baking soda will be used up in the initial reaction.  If the citric acid were to be neutralized, you'd get sodium citrate, not another acetate.\n\nYou're spot on with the distilled vinegar though.  I've tried making sodium diacetate using baking soda and 12% industrial vinegar before.  The residual alcohols make the pre-crystalized blob brown and gave the powder an off flavor.",

Wouldn't something similar happen with an ice bath in this recipe? I'd be more comfortable letting it cool down at room temp with some patience. \n2. You can convert baking soda into washing soda with just a pan, some foil, and an oven, making it a stronger base. Don't ask how I know this, *hehe*.

    "body": "I usually walk past pre-made food and the soups, but I'm a bad cook, and have been trying new Costco convenience foods. But I definitely found a new cheat meal for my man and I!! It's so freaking good too. All I needed to do is heat it up, add stuff, and touch up on the seasoning. It's already got a great flavor punch and some good spiciness, but it gets diluted when you add to it, and I think the soup alone is kinda lacking.\n\nI just needed a medium/large pan and these 3 things:\n- 1 Kirkland Chicken Tortilla soup (2 per pack) - $4.85 per\n- 1 Kirkland canned Chicken breast  (6 per pack) - $2.33 per\n- 1 can S&W Black Beans (8 per pack) - $1.25 per, using the online $9.99 price since I couldn't find receipt.\n\nToss the soup in the pan, drain and add the chicken, rinse off the black beans, and throw it in. \nI let stuff heat up for a while on medium heat while I add some more seasoning, eyeballing and tasting:\n- Salt\n- Garlic powder\n- Onion powder\n- Cumin\n- Chili powder (Mexican style, just had that in the pantry)\n- Citric acid (to substitute a lemon or lime for some needed acidity)\n- MSG (just for fun, not in the picture)\n\nThe whole pan of soup cost me $8.43, and made 5 cups of quick easy soup at 223 calories each & 31.6g protein. We're dieting and need protein for weight training, so this is pretty rockin'.\n\nI turned those 5 cups into 2 square leftover portions for lunches, and left the last cup for me as a small side soup w/ dinner. \nIt's definitely way better than the base soup, and the amount stretches since the original soup is maybe 3.5 cups alone (so the calories may be even less realistically). And pretty damn filling/satisfying, so 2 cups for a meal is fantastic for 446 cal & 63.2 g protein.\n\nEven with this basic quick version, I think more beans and chicken would be better. So with my 2nd soup container tomorrow, I'll double the chicken & bean cans. But this is friendlier for kids and stuff.\n\n(Btw I know I could make something like this cheaper from scratch, but again, this is not time-consuming at all and pretty damn convenient when I need a quick, hot, filling meal w/ protein goals met)\n\nIf anyone else has good quick Costco-only meals where I don't need to hit other stores, let me know!!",

    "body": "After having to deal with one too many people telling me that Keto is no better than a basic calorie restricted diet, I did some research and decided to arm myself with knowledge. What follows is a piece I typed up mainly for my own benefit and a few of my other keto-friends, but I thought I should share it here so others might benefit from it as well.\n\nDisclaimer: This is all based off my own personal research and I will openly admit it very well might be flawed. Anyone who knows better please correct me...\n\n**How Keto Works**\n\nIt is common knowledge that weight loss can be expressed as a function of calories in vs. calories out. Eat too many calories and you store fat, eat less calories and you burn fat. This is a true statement in general but the one thing to keep in mind is that this is a gross simplification of how the body works. There are actually many other factors at play. In order to expand on these other factors we first need to understand how the body works in a typical scenario.\n\nThe body has many ways to store energy, but two of the most common are glycogen and ketones. Glycogen is formed from carbohydrates, while ketones are derived from fat. The body prefers glycogen because it requires less energy to make, this is sort of a path of least resistance scenario. When we ingest carbs, they immediately get turned into glucose and the body does one of three things (maybe four) with them: \n\n1. If our blood glucose is low, they will immediately be used in order to increase the blood glucose level.\n2. If our blood glucose is normal, but our glycogen reserves are not at capacity, it will convert the glucose into glycogen, which is stored in the liver, and partly the muscle, for later use.\n3. If our blood glucose is normal, and our glycogen reserves are full, the glucose is converted into a triglyceride which is then stored in fat tissue.\n4. If our blood glucose is high, you are either insulin resistant or your pancreas is not functioning properly. You have bigger problems.\n\nThis whole process is regulated by our pancreas, which secretes two hormones, insulin and glucagon. Insulin signals the body to reduce the blood glucose level by telling adipose fat tissue to take in the extra blood glucose and store it away as fat. Glucagon signals the body to increase blood glucose level by telling the liver to release glucose into the bloodstream (glycogen is what it uses to make the glucose). The problem with eating a carbohydrate rich diet is that we are constantly adding a bunch of glucose into our system, which is then causing \"insulin spikes\" to try and tame our rapidly skyrocketing blood glucose level. Unless we have depleted our glycogen reserves this insulin response causes the glucose to be immediately stored as fat. Even more scary though is if we keep doing this long enough, there is a possibility to develop an insulin resistance. Now you are pre-diabetic. \n\nThis repetitive spiking of insulin any time we eat, causes us to almost always have an elevated level of insulin. The elevated level of insulin actually prevents us from converting fat into energy, because the insulin is signaling the body to do the exact opposite. This is why on a carbohydrate heavy diet, you become lethargic and sleepy if you don't eat.Your body is so reliant on a constant stream of glucose that you become very inefficient at actually converting stored fat back into a usable form of energy.\n\nSo how do we break this cycle and get our body back on track? Eat fewer carbs. So now that we understand how the glucose pathway (glycolosis), lets discuss the less known, and less used ketone pathway (ketogenesis).\n\nSo if you think back to biology you might remember things called mitochondria, the citric acid cycle, and ATP. Basically mitochondria use the citric acid cycle and an input, either Pyruvate which is derived from glucose, or Acetly-CoA which is a ketone body. They both can be used to create ATP, the energy of our body, but they come from very different pathways.\n\nKetone bodies are produced when the body is depleted of carbohydrate stores such as glycogen, and there is a low level of blood glucose. When our body gets to this point it realizes it needs some way to create energy (ATP), but it has to start using a secondary method of getting ATP. This is where ketogenesis comes into play. The body can use Acetyl-CoA which is a ketone, to fuel the citric acid cycle. At this point you might be wondering how does the body manage to maintain a safe blood glucose level?\n\nWhen in ketosis the blood glucose level is maintained through a process called gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis is a process by which the body can generate glucose from fatty-acids. The fatty acids are provided by our diet, and fat stores (love handles). So by not eating carbs we are forcing our body to derive glucose and ATP from forms of fat. All the while because we are not bombarding our metabolism with glucose from carbs, we have a very small, and very stable amount of insulin in our systems. If you remember back to what Insulin does, it effectively tells our body to pull glucose out of the blood stream and store it; so with low-stable insulin levels this means we have very small opportunity to store fat while in ketosis. \n\nAnother benefit of being in ketosis is now our ketone pathway is firing on all cylinders, and there is no insulin to hinder retrieval of fatty acids from fat stores, we are able to very efficiently create energy from the fat stores that we have. This is why intermittent fasting is such a great compliment to keto. This is also where the \"clean-energy\" feeling comes from. Even if we go for 12+ hours without eating, it is possible to not feel sleepy or lethargic while in ketosis because the body has a readily available supply of fat that it can pump into the ketone pathway. There are also many other benefits of intermittent fasting such as autophagy, which is a process the body uses to do \"house cleaning\", basically the body recycles dysfunctional cells.\n\nI set out to just outline WHY keto is good, but I ended up writing a full discourse on HOW it is good. To summarize the main benefits of keto are:\n\n* It manipulates your metabolism to a state where converting fat into energy is extremely easy.\n\n* It regulates insulin production, and prevents or even corrects, insulin resistance.\n\n* It provides very consistent and clean energy levels by stabilizing insulin production, and promoting use of fat stores as energy in periods of fasting.\n\nSo even though it is possible to lose weight using a normal calorie-restricted approach, the keto approach is much more conducive to weight loss, because it promotes the burning of fat as energy. It also allows you to eat more calories because the ketone pathway is overall less efficient than the glucose pathway, in terms of ATP/calorie, this goes back to the path of least resistance thing.\n\n\n**EDIT:** Wow this got much more attention than I was expecting. I have been at work all day, but I will do my best to respond to all the questions/messages when I get home tonight. Also, thanks to whoever gave me the gold!\n\n**EDIT2:** I will be updating this over the next day or so to incorporate all of the errors/issues people pointed out in the comment discussions. Thanks for all the great info and feedback everyone!\n",

        "body": "Cool post! I love when people take time to think things out, and discuss them. \n\n> When we ingest carbs, they immediately get turned into glucose and the body does one of three things...\n\nSugar (sucrose, glucose-fructore) throws a wrench in that. Fructose is metabolized almost exclusively in the liver.  There it gets turned into triglycerides.  During that time, the liver cannot metabolize glucose, so your pancreas has to work harder to contend with the blood glucose. Fructose isn't regulated by insulin, but forces an abnormally high insulin response for the glucose in your body. Once fructose is metabolized into fat, it's ready to be stored by the elevated insulin level.\n\n\n> This is why on a carbohydrate heavy diet, you become lethargic and sleepy if you don't eat.Your body is so reliant on a constant stream of glucose that you become very inefficient at actually converting stored fat back into a usable form of energy.\n\n\nAmong many other things, insulin inhibits fat mobilization. It isn't a matter of the body being \"efficient\" at it. If insulin is high, you can't use your fat stores. You become sleepy and lethargic because you're starving, internally. The body is trying to conserve what little energy it thinks it has. There's no longer a ton of glucose going around, but you *cannot* use any of your fat stores for energy. You become hungry for the only nutrient your body can use: carbohydrates. And if that's not a vicious circle, I don't know what is.\n\n\n>It is common knowledge that weight loss can be expressed as a function of calories in vs. calories out.\n\nThe calories paradigm bothers me. People go into very long-winded explanations on metabolism and homeostasis... only to then turn around and say \"but also the body is just a trash bag for calories.\" Because that's what calories-in/calories-out says. You spend an entire post on the careful regulation going on inside the body, but as far \"calories\" are concerned, none of that applies. Throw food at the body and it automatically creates fat, completely disregarding how the body works. Just below is the opening of chapter 14 of *Good Calories, Bad Calories* by G. Taubes, entitled \"The Mythology of Obesity\", to highlight the biggest issue with calories:\n\n>CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF any scientific enterprise is the ability to make accurate and unbiased observations. “To have our first idea of things, we must see those things,” is how Claude Bernard explained this in 1865; “to have an idea about a natural phenomenon, we must, first of all, observe it…. All human knowledge is limited to working back from observed effects to their cause.” But if the initial observations are incorrect or incomplete, then we will distort what it is we’re trying to explain. If we make the observations with preconceived notions of what the truth is, if we believe we know the cause before we observe the effect, we will almost assuredly see what we want to see, which is not the same as seeing things clearly.\n\n>The trouble with the science of obesity as it has been practiced for the last sixty years is that it begins with a hypothesis—that “overweight and obesity result from excess calorie consumption and/or inadequate physical activity,” as the Surgeon General’s Office recently phrased it—and then tries and *fails* to explain the evidence and the observations. The hypothesis nonetheless has come to be perceived as indisputable, a fact of life or perhaps the laws of physics, and its copious contradictions with the actual observations are considered irrelevant to the question of its validity. Fat people are fat because they eat too much or exercise too little, and nothing more ultimately need be said.\n\n>The more closely we look at the evidence and at obesity itself, the more problematic the science becomes. Lean people will often insist that the secret to their success is eating in moderation, but many fat people insist that they eat no more than the lean—surprising as it seems, *the evidence backs this up*—and yet are fat nonetheless. As the National Academy of Sciences report Diet and Health phrased it, “Most studies comparing normal and overweight people suggest that those who are overweight eat fewer calories than those of normal weight.” Researchers and public-health officials nonetheless insist that obesity is caused by overeating, without attempting to explain how these two notions can be reconciled. This situation is not improved by the prevailing attitude of many nutritionists, obesity researchers, and public-health authorities that it is evidence of untoward skepticism to raise such issues, or to ask questions that lead others into contemplating the contradictions themselves.",

    "body": "Hello r/Homebrewing,\n\nMy buddy and I have been brewing for awhile now. We started making extract kits a couple years ago, then switched to all-grain batches about 8 months ago. We bought a full gravity brew system and have been brewing pretty much every other week since then.\n\nA couple weeks ago we had to dump a batch of an IPA we brewed because it came out sour. We had gotten a little careless and didn't taste the beer at every stage that we could. We assumed we had picked up an infection somewhere, so we washed and sanitized all of our equipment and moved on.\n\nThe next batch was a pretty simple Pale Ale. We have a base recipe that we tweak a little bit each time we brew. It's a great way to sample different hop varieties, but it's a beer that we have brewed a dozens of times without an issue. We taste this batch at every stage and it's fine. We let it condition for a couple weeks in the bottle. Tasting day comes and we are shocked to find that the beer comes out sour and flat. What the hell? We sanitize all of the equipment again, and buy a new siphon and replace our plastic primary fermenters just in case.\n\nOur next batch was 10 gallons of a porter recipe we had not done before. Now, you are probably wondering why you would do a 10 gallon batch of a style of beer you had never worked with before, when you obviously have a major issue with your brewing process. You would be correct in thinking that.\n\nOur process is on point for this brew. We document every step this beer takes. We split the 10 gallons into two brand new primary fermenters. We use our brand new siphon to move those two batches into two meticulously cleaned and sanitized secondary fermenters. We sample the beer at every stage and find no issues with it. \n\nBottling day comes yesterday and we are both optimistic that we have eliminated any issues. We sample it before siphoning it into our bottling bucket and priming sugar mixture, no issues at all. We proceed to fill 130 bottles of non-sour porter. Just to be safe, we sample the last half-bottle that isn't going to get capped. It's sour. Brutally sour.\n\nMy buddy and I are dumbfounded at this point. I would like to think that we are both fairly intelligent people, but we just can't figure out what went wrong here. We've checked everything. \n\nAs I sit there, wondering how much I will be able to get from selling all this homebrewing equipment, I notice the bag of priming sugar. It's the only thing we haven't checked. I taste a small sample of it and find that it is carries the overwhelming taste of sour patch kids. Or sour skittles. Or the crushing reality that our process was not the issue and that we had been sold a three pound bag citric acid instead of priming sugar.\n\nI find this situation equal parts infuriating and hilarious. Always taste-test your ingredients I guess. \n\nTl;dr: Had 20 gallons of beer turn out flat & sour. Went crazy cleaning, sanitizing, and replacing equipment wherever possible. Turns out we had been trying unsuccessfully to make Sour Patch Kids Ale for the past two months.",

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat.

It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

I use Pixi toner day and night, it's given me a really nice glow but it might've been too much use. I'm also using HA (unrelated to this post) but I think due to my dehydrated skin, it's becoming even more dehydrated. I will try TO's Mandelic and maybe alternate it with Pixi day to day.  I have just read a blog entry about TO Mandelic vs Stratia Mandelic and found it very informative.

Can you recommend any cleansers or toners to bring your skin's PH down to the appropriate level before applying HAs? \n\n2) Is there any issue with using two different HAs at the same time? Can I use some stridex pads and then throw some TO Glycolic Acid on top? Or do I want to wait 20 minutes in between each HA?\n\n3) If we are to wait in between HAs, then I wash my skin down to a good Ph to apply my first HA..but then 20 minutes later my Ph is going to be back to a 6. I wouldn't want to wash again, what do I do to repeatedly drag down my Ph??",

But I found Kapln lacking for B/B and especially for P/S (and flat-out wrong for some concepts), so I incorporated some information from the 300-page P/S doc and also from my actual classes.\n\nLink to notes: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Qmkd\\_IHLPCSNFaig2-\\_uUzgWw9Xuxcoh?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Qmkd_IHLPCSNFaig2-_uUzgWw9Xuxcoh?usp=sharing)\n\nThe act of making these notes—then reading through all of them again, and coming back to them for recall—is a big part of what helped me prepare. So I would recommend using these notes as just another resource and not your sole source of information. (Though Kapln books are stupid expensive, so use them in the way that works for you best)\n\nI already had a solid background on biochem from class, so my notes don't go into too much detail about the steps of glycolysis/citric acid cycle/ETC. And I made these notes for myself, so some of the language might be cryptic.\n\nIf you want to use these notes, I recommend that you **open them in Google Docs** and **enable table of contents** (button on the left) **and continuous scroll** (View -> turn off Print Layout).\n\nI hope these are helpful to some people. I believe in all of y'all!",

    "body": "So I (20F) have food allergies but it’s not what people think. I don’t go into anaphylaxis or need an epi-pen, it’s a very mild reaction except for it can stick with me for days afterwards. The most notable is my tomato allergy. It’s high in citric acid (the main issue) and causes blisters in my mouth that can fill with blood and bust for weeks after I eat something with tomato in it and they just don’t heal up quickly because I sort of have to keep eating even if they’re there. Don’t get me wrong, I love pizza, marinara sauce and the like but there will ALWAYS be a price to pay afterwards. Sometimes I’m just more equipped to deal with it than others, and it’s very small amounts can cause the blisters. \n\nWith this, the other day my friends and I went to a fast food place and I just wanted a cheeseburger with extra cheese, lettuce, and mayo. Usually I like ketchup but today I didn’t think I could handle the blisters so I skipped it. When I got my order, there was tomato on it, which is no big deal. I took it up and asked them to remake it and went to sit down. Except when I was called up almost a minute later they handed me my food which was very fast for a remake. After I sat down I checked and, sure enough, I could see a seed that came from the tomato they had just picked off which was an issue because the juice it left behind alone is enough to cause the blisters. \n\nI took it back up and told them that I needed them to remake it and not just pick off the tomato, that it already defeated the purpose by coming in contact with the rest. The cashier tried to argue with me that it wasn’t a real allergy since tomato wasn’t in their allergen book (it’s a relatively uncommon allergy, I’ll admit) and that there was no reason to remake it. From here I told her I wanted to talk to her manager and a refund since I just wanted to go somewhere that wasn’t going to try and force me to eat an allergen. She’s mad but she gets her manager and after about twenty minutes of arguing with him he gives me the refund and says I can keep the burger I already had (I threw it out because I can’t eat it). \n\nAfterwards when I left with my friends they told me that I was making the cashier’s life difficult and I should have just picked it off and ate it because “you’ve done it plenty before” and “it’s not like you’re deathly allergic”. While it’s true, I really didn’t feel like dealing with a few weeks of blisters just because. While I could have just eaten it, I really don’t feel like it’s right I should have to suffer just because it would makes their lives a bit easier. So AITA because I kicked up a fuss over something that’s arguably stupid?",

    "body": "It’s never a good look to be visibly startled by your coworker’s existence. Especially when you’re the only human on a spaceship, and you’ve surprised more than one shorter alien by turning a corner too quickly. I should have known better after tripping over Mur’s tentacles that one time; blind corners are risky. Anything could come around them. And the rest of that little courier ship’s crew ran the range of appearances. None of them should have given me much of a shock at that point. \n\nBut dang, Trrili looked *scary*. I couldn’t help flinching every time she appeared when I wasn’t expecting it. \n\nPicture this: I was talking to Coals, the burly little Heatseeker with deep red scales and a quiet demeanor. We were outside the office-type room where some of the crew did translation work to bring us extra money. He was telling me about a random poem that someone had broadcast through space; I was thinking about whether his full name fit on paperwork; his name is Glowing Coals (Which Create the Heat We All Love) — that’s not important, but the point is, I didn’t expect Trrili to step out of the doorway, and I jumped. \n\nShiny black and red, bug eyes and mandibles, *taller than me*, pincher arms, and far more stealth than should honestly be allowed. Seriously, Zhee was the same species, and he clicked when he walked, but Trrili was a master of stepping silently. And while Zhee was colored in gaudy purples, Trrili just looked *evil*. \n\nI did not say so out loud. I know better than that. But the flinching was an instinct, and there wasn’t much I could do about it. \n\nExcept laugh it off and apologize, of course. \n\n“Woah, didn’t see you there!” I laughed awkwardly. “Sorry. Has anyone ever told you that you’re very quiet?” \n\n“Yesss,” Trrili said with a completely unnecessary hiss. “It has been said.” I was still learning Mesmer facial expressions, but I was pretty sure that her antenna angle meant amusement. She was smirking at me. \n\n“Don’t encourage her,” said Coals, pulling my attention back down to hip height. He was short for a Heatseeker, with stocky proportions that made him look like a lizard-turned-teddy-bear when standing next to the hulking terror that was *just another person, dang it, no matter how creepy.* \n\n“Encourrrrage?” Trrili purred with an unsettling crackle to her voice, crouching to loom over Coal’s shoulder. \n\nHe didn’t bat an eye, still gazing placidly up at me. “*Some* of us take unseemly pleasure in predatory games.” \n\nTrrili flexed a pincher ominously, sliding back into the shadows. “Sssssome of us are good at it.” \n\n“Like I said,” Coals told me as she disappeared. “Don’t encourage her. She’s very proud of herself.” \n\n“Well, isn’t that Mesmers in a nutshell?” I asked, trying for a smile. “Mesmerizing and magnificent and ready for everyone to acknowledge it?” \n\nWhatever Coals was about to say was lost as Trrili sprang out to land with half her bug legs climbing the wall, filling the corridor with black-and-red nightmares, hissing. \n\nI jerked in place. “Ngah!” \n\nTrrili’s hissing laughter merged with a long-suffering sigh from Coals. \n\n“Welcome to Trrili’s favorite game,” he said. “The captain made her promise to stop scaring Paint, after one too many breakable things got dropped.” \n\nTrrili gathered her limbs into a more civilized configuration. “Paint is too easy to startle,” she said, without a trace of a hiss. *(Ha! Knew she was doing that on purpose.)* “Hardly a challenge.” \n\nI tried to pretend that I wasn’t 50% adrenaline at the moment. “How many times have you gotten smacked in the face on reflex?” \n\nTrrili spread her arms. “My trrrrack record is exssssellent.” \n\nI didn’t point out the inconsistent hissing. “Anybody ever try to scare you back?” \n\n“None successsssfully,” she said with a tilt to her head that I chose to interpret as arrogant. \n\nI shifted my weight onto one food, aiming for casual as my heart rate calmed back to nearly normal. “And are you the type to snap somebody’s head off as a startle reflex, or would you take that *well?”* \n\nAnother hissing laugh. “We may never know!” \n\n“She’d just flare at you,” Coals said. When I looked down at him, he raised his arms in a loose approximation of a Mesmer threat display. “‘Oh no, a scary thing! I’d better show it I’m scarier!’” \n\nA frightening face appeared to glare at him from up close, but he ignored it with the ease of long practice. \n\n“Good to know,” I said. “Well, I should get going, to do the things I was going to do. Some things. Right, check the supply list! It’s been nice talking to you!” \n\nI waved and left, nerves still singing that I could get jumped at any moment. Thankfully only goodbyes followed me to a more populated part of the ship. I had a supply list to check, and now also a careful prank to consider. \n\nI found Zhee in the supply room.  \n\n“Question for you,” I said by way of greeting. “Well, several. Do you and Trrili come from the same planet, or are there Mesmers everywhere? I don’t actually know.” \n\nHe stopped counting soup cans or whatever and quirked one purple antenna in a fair approximation of a raised eyebrow. “Several planets and three dozen moons have been graced with Mesmer populations,” he told me. “I have no idea which population center she hatched in. Somewhere fond of malicious cackling.” \n\n“Ah,” I said. “Yup, she does seem to like that.” Since he was still looking at me (from a reasonable height, which was nice), I continued. “Are you familiar with snakes?” \n\n“That’s an animal from your homeworld, isn’t it?” Zhee asked. “Something with scales?” \n\nI nodded vigorously. “Picture small a Heatseeker without arms or legs, just a long body that wriggles across the ground.” I made vague gestures. “Like a head on top of a tail.” \n\n*“Why?”* was his only answer. \n\nI shrugged. “They eat little animals that live in holes in the dirt. Being long and narrow makes it easier for them to find prey.” \n\n“Oh, well, obviously,” Zhee said with a wave of one pincher arm. “Can’t argue with *that.”* \n\nI couldn’t tell if he was kidding or not. “Some of them are venomous, with a bite that can kill a much bigger animal.” \n\nZhee rested his pinchers on the box of soup cans, and rotated his head at an uncomfortable angle. “And why are you asking if I’m familiar with them?” \n\nI went for honesty. “I want to startle her back.” \n\n“Ah! Well, then.” Zhee turned away from the box, his many legs tapping quietly as he gave me his full attention. “That I would like to see. What is your plan?” \n\n“Still rough at this point,” I admitted. “But there’s a classic prank where I’m from called a snake-in-a-can…” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I went a slightly different route, and had to wait until after our next supply run. That was a long wait. Trrili made two more surprise appearances, laughing at the way I twitched both times. At least I kept in my yelps of surprise. I found myself glad that she was so big, simply because it limited the dark corners she could jump out of. \n\nFinally my chance came. It was a casual mealtime with most of the crew coming and going from the kitchen and lounge, enjoying their favorite foodstuffs after the recent restocking. I’d made a point of getting an over-hyped box of “Earth Foods For Humans,” and sat down at a table right next to the hallway. \n\nPaint came over to eat with me, all splotchy orange scales and a sunny disposition. I showed her some of the many things in the box, just waiting for the inevitable. \n\nA shadow fell over the table. Paint meeped quietly, her mouth full of fish. \n\nI turned to find shiny black mandibles spread wide, mere inches from my face. \n\n“Oh, hi Trrili.” \n\nShe closed up her face. “You arrrre becoming no fun,” she hissed. \n\n“Nonsense, I’m lots of fun,” I said, digging through the box. “Hey, while you’re here, I’ve been meaning to ask Zhee: can you guys actually smell ripe fruit? Since you don’t eat it?” I pulled out a bruised orange and removed a chunk of peel, holding it up for her to sniff. \n\n“It smells like a plant,” Trrili replied. “Somewhat sharp and unpleasant.” \n\n“Huh. I guess that’s the citric acid,” I said, setting it down and digging some more. “You’re missing out; it smells delicious to me. Oh hey, look at this!” I pulled out the stiff paper envelope I’d hidden in the box earlier. \n\nBoth of them were watching. So was Zhee from the next table over, but he was doing a good job of pretending he wasn’t. \n\n“These are such a delicacy,” I said, flipping the envelope over but not opening it. The front held a picture of a snake. I waved at Zhee. “Hey, remember those venomous animals I was talking about? The ones with the rattle on their tails? I got some of their eggs!” \n\n“You are welcome to them,” Zhee said. \n\n“I think you guys would probably like these,” I said with a glance up at Trrili. “They’re really pretty; they seem like the kind of thing a Mesmer would appreciate. Here, have a look.” I handed her the envelope while I made a show of digging around some more to see what else was in the jumble of potatoes, beef jerky, and triple-bagged stinky cheese. \n\nTrrili took the envelope, gentle with those little wrist fingers that let her manipulate things with pincher arms. I deliberately didn’t watch, instead keeping my eyes on Paint, who was opening her mouth to ask a question. \n\nWhen I heard the loud rattle, I whipped my head up in time to see Trrili toss the envelope away and flare her pinchers in a hissing threat display that was every bit as dramatic as I’d imagined. \n\nPaint shrieked. \n\nZhee laughed the hardest I’d ever heard him. \n\n“It’s okay,” I said, grinning to split my face as I picked up the envelope from the floor. Other people were asking questions, though Zhee’s obvious amusement kept them from getting too worried. “It’s not real.” \n\nWhile Trrili hissed quietly, I upended the envelope over my hand. The contraption that fell out was the most low-tech of pranks: a bent wire, a rubber band, and a metal washer that had rattled against the paper when the envelope was opened, releasing pressure. I’d wound it up just before leaving my quarters. And it had worked *beautifully*. \n\n“What is that?” Paint asked, still leaning away from the table. \n\n“Karma,” I said, holding it up and spinning the washer, still grinning. “What do you think, Trrili? Mesmer approved?” \n\nTrrili folded her arms tight against her body and angled her antennae into a fierce glare.  She left without a word, stomping instead of moving silently. \n\nZhee was still chuckling. “Mesmer approved,” he declared. “That was excellent.” \n\n“Oh good,” I said. \n\nPaint settled gingerly back into her seat. “Where are the eggs?” she asked. \n\n“There aren’t any,” I said, tucking the gadget away and picking up the orange again to resume peeling. “Rattlesnakes don’t even lay eggs; they have live birth.” \n\n“Oh,” Paint said. \n\n“But Trrili didn’t know that.” I separated a slice of orange and popped it into my mouth. “Think she’ll lay off the startling?” \n\n“Hm. Probably not; she really likes it.” \n\n“Then I may just have to come up with a few more surprises for her,” I said, smiling with all of my human teeth. “My people have an entire industry for things like this, and I have a childhood full of ideas.” \n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\n*Further adventures in backstory for* [*this book.*](https://books2read.com/b/bOnEWJ) *More to come!* \n\n*Cross-posted to* [*Tumblr*](https://marlynnofmany.tumblr.com/post/707887133533372416/whats-a-minor-heart-attack-between-friends) *and* [*HumansAreSpaceOrcs*](https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/10p652f/whats_a_minor_heart_attack_between_friends/)*.*",

After a few months it started to coat our dishes with the worst odor, some of our drinking glasses would smell like wet dog the moment water touched them. Really nasty stuff. I did all the usual stuff, cleaning out the filter / trap, looking for issues with the impeller, trying different cleaning cycles, no dice.\n\nDishwasher tech came out free of charge, inspected it quickly and told us there's two routes to fix it - use some pre-packaged dishwasher cleaning packets or go buy a jar of Tang powder and throw a spoonful in the basin every now and again. He said that dishwasher cleaner is more or less just a bunch of citric acid and you can get it much cheaper out of Tang.\n\nI was honestly skeptical, but I've been throwing a little in with each load for months now and the smell is completely gone. Highly recommended, thought I'd share!",

    "body": "I’ve been working on this image for a couple weeks and posted earlier versions of it here.  This is the final one that I’m satisfied with.  I am an all-analog person and have a full photographic darkroom along with a nice DIY UV box.  The original image is on 35mm infrared film from an image I shot in November 1976 at Death Valley, CA using a red filter.  I’ve been asked about my process so here goes:\n\nSince I am going to use multiple films and exposures, I use a registration system.  I have a two-hole paper punch and punch a piece of paper.  I then put two registration pins through those holes and tape them to a piece of card stock.  These are my “master” pins. \n\nI first enlarge the original image onto an 8x10 sheet of lithographic film that I have punched with the registration holes.  I also cut a very small piece of the upper-right corner with the emulsion side facing me so I can always locate the emulsion side after processing.  This film usually results in an image that is solid blacks and clear areas but I allow some mid-tones by developing it in Dektol diluted 1:10 (one part stock Dektol to 10 part water).  I make 3 separate images, one underexposed, one correctly exposed, and one overexposed.  I label these resulting positives P1, P2, and P3.  After they are dry I use each one to make a contact print of it on another sheet of litho film and develop it the same, resulting in 3 negatives which I label N1, N2, and N3.   It is important to note that since the contact prints are made emulsion to emulsion, the cut corners on the negatives will be in the upper-left when viewed correctly, that is, when what is on the left side of the original image is on the left in the negative..\n\nI prepare my cyanotype paper (Bockingford HP 140) which I first soak in a 5% citric acid solution to endure any buffering is neutralized.  I let it dry and then coat with the “new” cyanotype solution and let dry.   I then punch it with registration holes.\n\nFor exposure, I have a workbench in my shop (down the hallway from the darkroom) where I’ve taped down those registration pins.  I locate the coated paper on the pins, with the coated side up.  The next step of the process it to place the first film on the pins.  I am using P3 for this and place it, emulsion side down on the pins, meaning that the cut corner is in the upper left.  I cover this with a sheet of glass to keep it flat.  My UV light is comprised of UV LED strips in a box (actually a wooden drawer that I repurposed for this) and it is on legs that keep the lights 12” about the paper.  I place this over the film and paper, set its timer to 9 minuets (determined by previous testing) and let it go.\n\nFor processing I soak the paper in a tray of 10% sulphamic acid solution for 5 minutes, rocking the tray the whole time.  It then gets placed in a running water bath for 15 minutes.  Since our water has a ph of 7-8, I then give the paper a 3 minute soak in a 5% citric acid solution followed by a quick 15 second rinse in the water bath.  (This final soak in the citric acid might be unnecessary but I do it anyway.)\n\nI use a print roller (hand held) to remove water and then place the paper on a drying rack.\n\nAfter it is dry, I repeat the previous process: recoat the paper, make another expose, process and dry the paper.  For the second exposure, I am using a sandwich of films P1 and N2, with the cut corners of P1 in the upper-left and N2 in the upper-right.  Exposure is, again, for 9 minutes.  The processing is the same as the first round.\n\nThe third expose is done with N1 (which only passes light to the foreground of the image, and I reduce the expose time to 3 minutes.  Processing is the same except that I skip the final citric acid soak.\n\nThat’s the process I used to produce the image shown above.  It took a while to work out all the bugs but this whole “tone separation” process (also known as “posterization”) with film is something I’ve been doing for many decades, sometimes making the final image by silk screening.  If you are making digital negatives for your cyanotypes, you should be able to use this same process.\n\nEnjoy.\n",

However, as I will expound later in this post, *please take all of this with the fattest grain of salt*. Use your own brain to criticize what I say and build your own study plan based on what works for *you* :)\n\n**1. Overview + advice:**\n\nI studied from 6/16/24 to 9/13/24, so just under 3 months. I don't recommend studying for any shorter than that; cramming definitely does not work with the sheer volume of necessary material (take it from a chronic crammer/procrastinator). I did a diagnostic, started reading and annotating my Kaplan books for content review, and did practice questions/FLs starting from the first week. This worked out pretty well for me because then I didn't have to rush content review (imo a very bad idea) before starting practice, and my mistakes in practice guided my content review. I studied for 3-5 hours each day, took many days off when I was overwhelmed, and just made sure to compensate on the topics/time I'd missed. I also kept a spreadsheet of all my incorrect answers from CP, BB, and PS wherein I explained the topic and correct answer in my own words. This helped a lot, especially in the beginning when my content base was lacking.\n\nMy biggest piece of advice is to be critical when using others' advice and creating your own study plan. When I was getting started, I was so stressed over seemingly infinite posts, blogs, videos, advertisements, all telling you what is 100% right/wrong for MCAT studying. The fact is, there is no magic bullet. Start with free AAMC resources, and go with your gut from there. If you're not already familiar with Anki, don't waste weeks trying to figure it out. If you know you don't do well passively reading, take notes. Just follow what you have found to work for you in the past, and don't let an Internet stranger's advice get in the way! And if something isn't working, change it up! It's not irresponsible/fickle to adapt your study plan along the way. I changed mine like 15 times. Just keep yourself accountable and continue to work hard throughout.\n\nAnother huge thing for me was making sure I was rested and feeling good on test day. I packed lots of food and caffeine the night before, slept over at my partner's place (yes, SLEEP), and woke up early on test day. I wore comfy clothes and brought a sweater, my test center staff were super nice and helpful, and I used the noise-cancelling headphones (they're uncomfortable but hearing the quiet room is worse). \n\n**2. Full-Lengths:** \\[Blueprint Diagnostic: 508\\] 510/513/515/508\\*/516\\*/520/519/515/526/520/513\\*/513\\*\n\n\\*taken from Kaplan/TPR\n\nI tried to take one FL a week, didn't always meet that goal, and then when I got down to \\~2 weeks before the exam I was taking a FL about every 4 days or so. This was extremely helpful to me in building stamina and getting used to the test, and was honestly more enjoyable than practice questions sometimes. As you can see, my scores were all over the place. Each test is very different so it may play to your strengths/weaknesses differently (except for CARS, those are mostly the same). This back-and-forth stressed me out a lot at the time, but I just kept trying to study the concepts I was shaky on rather than freaking out over my scores.\n\n**3. Resources:** I wasted a lot of (my own) money on resources that did not help because they came highly recommended by others. Please don't be like me.\n\nI was gifted a set of 2024-25 Kaplan books (\\~$200) that were really helpful because I was 2+ years out from most of my core classes and had a lot of relearning to do. They take a very detailed approach which can get tedious at times, but I basically recommend them wholeheartedly.\n\nI bought all the AAMC resources (\\~$310). These I recommend 100%! Figures, but the AAMC material was the best in preparing me to actually take the exam. I took all the FLs and then took some over again. Did all the questions. The Content Outline (which is free!) was foundational for me in figuring out what topics I still needed to nail down. I used the associated Khan Academy videos, those were amazing, too.\n\nMy hottest take may be that I do not recommend UPlanet. I bought the full question bank ($319), did about 200 out of thousands. I hated the format and felt that it tested a lot of material that the AAMC does not. Sure, if you finish it all you will be well-prepared, because you'll be OVER-prepared. In my mind, the extra time, effort, and consternation UPlanet required was not worth it.\n\nI also bought Memm ($219). Did not use it after a week or so. Tried to use all the popular Reddit Anki decks (MileDown, etc.). I hated Anki and gave up. Something about flashcards made by other people just was not helpful to me, and I was wasting a lot of time trying to make it so. \n\nI used free FLs from Kaplan and TPR and bought 3 Kaplan FLs ($129). I found them to be 5-10 points deflated, which could be falsely discouraging. I do think that this was unexpectedly helpful, because then when I took the real exam I thought it was much easier than the last 2 Kaplan exams I had taken, but I wouldn't count on that always being the case. \n\nI did find the free Jack Westin webpages that explain MCAT topics to be pretty helpful! I used them towards the end of my studying when I was confused on very granular aspects of a topic (ex. different stomach cell types and their secretions, etc.)\n\n**4. Randoms**\n\nPracticing AAMC CARS material can definitely help you improve your score whether you're a big reader or not. It's about learning AAMC logic, not becoming an expert in lit studies. \n\nDon't expect to be able to pause your life (school, job, etc.) for the MCAT. Plan accordingly. At the same time, you can communicate your needs to family, bosses, etc. and try to strike the best balance possible.\n\nOn test day, have faith in yourself! Trust your gut. I believe a huge contributor to my score was being at peace, trusting my own judgement, and not getting too freaked out by things I hadn't seen before or confusing questions. \n\nAndrey K on YouTube is the best, especially for biochem! I used him all throughout undergrad, too. \n\nStart studying the amino acids, citric acid cycle, the ETC, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and all the other metabolism products/processes from Day 1! SUCH high-yield material, and simply rote memorizing them early will save you so much time and anguish.\n\nThere is high-yield, but there is no such thing as low-yield. To skip studying \"low-yield\" topics is to guarantee yourself missed points.\n\nAt the end of the day, the MCAT is only one piece of your application. You just need a score, regardless of what it is, to be eligible to apply. If you can believe it, I nearly rescheduled/voided my exam because I was so afraid of getting a poor score. Don't be like me! Trust yourself and remember that you are a whole person, not just a few numbers on a page!\n\n**5. Ok I'm done.** Due to my short attention span and generally disorganized mind, I'll end it here. I'll try to answer questions in the comments if y'all have any! Best of luck studying, my friends【≽\\^•⩊•\\^≼】",

Might be time to re-evaluate the “best” ways to study. Congrats on the insane score!",

    "body": "**Warning:** Long story -- *I promise it's worth it*\n\nThis all happened about 6 hour ago.  \n\nToday was the weekly lab session for my food science course, which is really just a glorified cooking course. This week, we were going to be making homemade sausage from scratch. Since this is a large class, and there is limited kitchen space, everyone is put into cooking groups of 4-5 other students.  \n\nFor a little bit of background, I have had some pretty bad luck with my group members for this class so far. Each time so far, I've been put in the same group as this one girl who I'm pretty sure is on the autism spectrum. We'll call her Rachel. She can be pretty difficult to work with at times, and has a hard time following the directions given by the teacher. Last week, when we were making bread, we had put Rachel in charge of measuring the ingredients. Unfortunately, she decided that just 800 grams of flour was not enough, and proceeded to dump **two whole bags of flour** into the mix of ingredients.  \n\nNeedless to say, the mix was ruined, so we had to start over again. However, Rachel became enraged that we had to abandon her perfect bread mix, and she literally started pulling garbage from the trash to throw at the other group members.  \n\nNow this week, I was paired with Rachel again. Little did I know, *she* wouldn't be a problem this time. This time, someone else would take her place. Another girl, Kristen, would soon prove that she was the firstborn child of Satan.  \n\nOn the outside, this girl seemed like a totally average, normal and functioning member of society. Inside...well, that's a whole other ballgame. The first red flag came when Kristen attempted to take control of the group. This is the point that history books will credit as the beginning of the Fourth Reich. She started gradually suggesting that other group members start gathering and measuring ingredients. However, the situation escalated rapidly when the lemon juice was to be measured.  \n\n30 mL of lemon juice were to be added to the mix, and we were to record the mass of the lemon juice added in grams. Kristen made the executive decision to just pour a nondescript amount of juice into a bowl that was on a scale. Normally, this would be fine, as long as you measured somewhere close to 30 grams of juice with the density of water in mind. Unfortunately, our understanding of basic physics has not yet been updated to include Kristen. The scale creeps upward to show a final reading of 18 grams of lemon juice in the bowl.  \n\nKristen insists that this is correct, despite my disagreement. As a chemical engineering major, I have a pretty good grasp on basic chemistry and unit conversions. As I try to tell her that it should be much, much closer to 30 grams, she rebuts by explaining the math behind her measurement.  \n\nI was incorrect, because the additional pressure within the lemon juice from the citric acid it contains causes the volume to condense, making the density of the juice about double the density of water, meaning that only half as many grams of juice would equal the same grams of water.  \n\nI really wished that I had learned this in school.  \n\nWhen I tell her that what she said has literally no mathematical or scientific correctness, she **flips her shit**. I'm talking a Chernobyl-level meltdown. She starts shrieking at me in the most bloodcurdling tone, while her face turns the deepest most saturated red I have ever seen. The teacher does not even react -- she knows you can't deal with this kind of crazy. fortunately, after about a minute, she loses steam, and practically forgets that she was about to gouge my eyes with a measuring spoon. Weird.  \n\nThings continued to get worse though, and she quickly became passive-aggressive. If things were not done exactly as she said, you would get a snarky remark. She also used this tactic to try and rationalize her own errors. After all, *someone* must have added too much grease to the sausage stuffing machine. Hint: it was her.  \n\nEvery 10-15 minutes, something would set her off the edge, and she would begin shrieking again. Kristen was like a tea kettle that was always *almost boiling*. And after enough time, she would just keep steaming to let off heat. She was quick to tire, returning to whatever she was doing with little memory of the atrocities she spewed through the air. This went on for three and a half hours. The real fuck up had been building for hours at this point.  \n\nWhen it finally came time to fill the sausage casings, I made the critical mistake of putting the casing onto the stuffing machine's outlet tube. In all fairness, putting pig intestines onto this plastic tube does look like you're putting a slimy anus condom onto a plastic phallus. Nobody needed to point it out though.  \n\nWhile I'm in the middle of pleasuring this machine, Kristen gets within literal millimeters of my face, and looks me straight in the eyes with a completely deadpan expression. \"Hey! That's my sausage! I never said you could touch it!\" she howls, following up with: \"You and I can play with sausage casings later though ;)\" Kristen whispers to me, trying to make her voice as sexy as possible. At this point, I've had so much of her shit, that it's practically exuding from my mouth. I told her I would never do anything, ever, with her. I never want to see her again, and I don't appreciate her harassing me. I gave it to her straight up, she was disgusting, had an atrocious attitude, and needed to just calm the fuck down.  \n\nI realized the gravity of the mistake I had made as soon as the words left my mouth. The sound that resulted was different from anything I've ever heard in my life. It was like one of those jungle scenes from any of the popular Vietnam War films. It's awfully quiet...*too quiet*. And then. **BLAMM!** All hell breaks loose, and a battlefield erupts with with roar of exploding artillery shells, screaming air-support, and the deafening cries of fallen soldiers. Kristen unleashed the nuclear option upon the kitchen. If she couldn't win, then nobody could.  \n\nHer plan for mutually assured destruction had been launched. Her whole body turned red with rage. Tears, which might as well have been jet fuel, poured from her eyes at a remarkable flow rate. If anyone could cry a river, she'd be the one to do it. She booked it out of the kitchen once she realized that everyone had seen her crack for the last time. Everyone was confused and dumbfounded. My food science teacher then told the class that nobody would have to worry about being in a group with Kristen again.  \n\nIf I had to guess, I don't think she'll be coming back...\n\n\n**TL;DR: Touched her sausage, refused prostitution, went to 'Nam.**",

    "body": "I'm from Northeast US, and this is my Moby-Dick.\n\n**The Backstory**\n\nWhen I was a young child, my family visited Gloucester, UK for a few months. My mom every other day bought me a gingerbread man from Sainsbury's. They were gingerbread man-shaped biscuits with chocolate ganache instead of icing for the decorations; they also had M&M's (adhered with the ganache) as their buttons.\n\n[**Here is a picture of the culprit, the 1997 Sainsbury's Gingerbread Man**](https://imgur.com/5e8bnkA)\n\nTo my mom, they were a cheap (\\~£0.50) small treat for a child; and to me, I'd never had anything that tasted like it.\n\nYears later when I was in college, my uncle had visited London and coincidentally happened to pick up a couple of these Sainsbury's gingerbread cookies. I had forgotten up until then, but one bite *instantly* brought me back to my childhood. And ever since then, I've been on a personal gingerbread quest to recreate them here.\n\nYears after that in August 2022, I had the opportunity to visit Bristol for a week where my mom and I visited multiple Sainsbury's-s in search of the mythical men. The bakery at the Clifton Down Shopping Centre location came through! A whole table of these [Sainsbury's Gingerbread Mummies](https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/new-355373-44/sainsburys-gingerbread-mummy-39g) (it was approaching Halloween). The chocolate ganache and M&M's are no longer used, but I can confirm with 100% certainty that the gingerbread cookie is nearly how I remember it. I can also confirm that the [Sainsbury's Gingerbread People 2-packs](https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000708136569.jpg) are also the same cookie as the mummy (that pic also shows the ingredients list).\n\n**Examining the 2022 Package's Ingredients List**\n\nI'm unsure of continuing with my efforts because I don't know if what I'm trying to do is futile. I'm convinced there's something different about the ingredients I have available vs. in the UK.\n\nThe packaged ingredients list, from what I understand:\n\n* \"Fortified British Wheat Flour\" = [same as Sainsbury's plain flour](https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/sainsburys-plain-flour-15kg)\n* \"Sugar\"\n* \"Vegetable Margarine\" = [kind of a match for Sainsbury's baking spread](https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/sainsburys-soft-spread-500g), but \"margarine\" means it would need to be 80% vegetable fat ([according to USDA 1996](https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/vegetableoilmargaine.pdf)), and the \"spread\" here is only 70%\n* \"Partially Inverted Refiners Syrup\" = Golden syrup, if [\"55% inverted\" means the same as \"partially inverted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_sugar_syrup#:~:text=periods%20of%20time.-,Golden%20syrup,-is%20a%20syrup)\"\n* \"Invert Sugar Syrup\" = [behaves kind of similarly to Light Corn Syrup](https://www.hanielas.com/invert-sugar-syrup/); it's made with granulated sugar & cream of tartar (or citric acid)\n* \"Whole Egg\"\n* \"Glucose Syrup\"\n* \"Ginger Powder\" = my dad thinks this is not just ginger but instead a spice blend that's mostly ginger.\n* \"Raising Agent: Sodium Hydrogen Carbonate\" = baking soda\n* \"Food Coloring\"\n* \"Dried Egg White\"\n* \"Cornflour\" = US calls this corn starch. What the US calls \"corn flour\", UK calls \"maize flour\".\n\nIt's the \"ginger powder\" here that's really throwing me for a loop. All the recipes I've seen and tried have the only spices be ginger and cinnamon. After having so many ginger and cinnamon cookies, it's either not just those spices *or* there's something different about UK ginger and UK cinnamon. I've bought fresh, organic ginger powder here, but no dice. I've also tried [mixing my own UK mixed spice blend](https://www.daringgourmet.com/british-mixed-spice/#recipe), but I think it's too floral. The culprit was more \"ginger spicy\". Maybe it's a touch of cardamom???\n\nAnother thought is if the US Lyle's Golden Syrup tastes different from the UK's? I wasn't able to taste the \"deep caramelized, buttery flavor\" in the cookies that used it. I get that flavor eating it straight but not when it's mixed into the cookie dough.\n\nI don't think US molasses is used at all in the Sainsbury's cookies. I can't get Lyle's Black Treacle at my grocery store's UK section, so I'm unsure if maybe it tastes totally different from unsulfured molasses.\n\n**My Attempts**\n\nI've tried 8 different gingerbread cookie recipes with multiple attempts for each trying to adjust ratios and swap ingredients:\n\n* [https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/best-gingerbread-cookies/](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/best-gingerbread-cookies/)\n* [https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/crisp-molasses-cookies/](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/crisp-molasses-cookies/)\n* [https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/molasses\\_spice\\_cookies/](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/molasses_spice_cookies/)\n* [https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/gingersnap\\_cookies/](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/gingersnap_cookies/)\n   * These were all attempted before pre-August 2022, so it took me a couple of tries until realizing that Sainsbury's are gingerbread biscuits, not cookies. I'm certain now that there's no molasses or black treacle used in their recipe.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121102003447/http://www.sainsburys-live-well-for-less.co.uk/recipes-inspiration/recipes/spooky-skeleton-biscuits/](https://web.archive.org/web/20121102003447/http://www.sainsburys-live-well-for-less.co.uk/recipes-inspiration/recipes/spooky-skeleton-biscuits/)\n   * One of Sainsbury's own recipes, and the recipe ingredients list closely resembles the packaged ingredients list. However, my attempt notes state that the spices could barely be tasted and the cookies were not crispy\n* [https://justasmidgen.com/2012/10/14/magnolias-iced-ginger-cookies/](https://justasmidgen.com/2012/10/14/magnolias-iced-ginger-cookies/)\n* [https://www.tiktok.com/@kimberleycooks/video/6902355003562937601?is\\_from\\_webapp=1&web\\_id=6957424227500148229](https://www.tiktok.com/@kimberleycooks/video/6902355003562937601?is_from_webapp=1&web_id=6957424227500148229)\n* [https://www.cuisinefiend.com/786/ginger-snaps](https://www.cuisinefiend.com/786/ginger-snaps)\n   * Another one where the recipe ingredients list closely resembles the packaged ingredients list. But a total miss because the demerara sugar (I used \"turbinado\") didn't dissolve, so the cookies tasted like hard scones.\n\nI've also bookmarked these recipes as potentials, but I'm highly doubtful any will be the solution, as discussed in the \"Examining\" section above:\n\n* [https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/recipe/ginger-crunch-creams](https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/recipe/ginger-crunch-creams) (likely not because it's not a biscuit and contains black treacle)\n* [https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/recipes/gingerbread-family](https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/recipes/gingerbread-family) (very similar to the other Sainsbury's recipe above, which was unsuccessful)\n* [https://food52.com/recipes/82275-kim-joy-s-gingerbread-cookies-recipe](https://food52.com/recipes/82275-kim-joy-s-gingerbread-cookies-recipe) (another black treacle recipe)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYnNBI7Vu0w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYnNBI7Vu0w) (another Sainsbury's recipe)\n* [https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/ultimate-easy-gingerbread](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/ultimate-easy-gingerbread) (matches the packaged ingredients list, although I'm skeptical about the dark muscovado sugar)\n\n**My Plea**\n\nI think I've exhausted my attempts without further inquiry into UK baking ingredients. The decorations on Sainsbury's change seasonally, so the current active biscuit match is this [\"Decorate Your Own\" Gingerbread x5 kit](https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/sainsburys-decorate-your-own-gingerbread-x5-tub). I could order a small parcel and get it freight-forwarded to the US for \\~$100, but I also think the 2022 cookie is not as \"spiced\" as the original 1997 recipe; I'm still holding out hope I can recreate them here in the US (and eventually decorate them with that chocolate ganache frosting).\n\nMy nostalgia and the elusiveness of this recipe definitely compound into how meaningful and special this cookie is to me. Any thoughts or ideas would be greatly appreciated. I'd give you a cookie for reading to the end if I knew how to bake it.",

I also know that as ethanol is being converted to acetate, the action of NAD is also required, as it gets converted back and forth to NAD and NADH during that process (since it's also a redox reaction).  Basically, when carbon dioxide is oxidized from citric acid, the electrons transfer to NDA+ to create NADH. \n\nSo, technically, that means that when alcohol enters the liver, there should be an overlap, right? Based on logic, that also means alcohol leads to an increase in fat storage, because the TCA transforms fat into energy, and if it does so at a lesser rate because of alcohol (due to NAD co-enzyme overlap), then there is also an increase in adipose uptake of triglycerides as a result (since they aren't used by the body as energy).\n\nHowever, I could be wrong, but if I understand correctly, it means ingestion of alcohol indirectly results in an increase in fat storage in the body? \n\nedit: I found the info here http://zwz.cz/f/allgood1186/1PJ5JPDV/Obrazky-metabolism-chart\n\nedit2: by 'does it increase fat storage?' I actually mean 'does it reduce the lipolysis rate?', sorry for using a misleading expression. I wish I could edit the title now. \n\nedit3: not too sure why this got so big. I just asked a question and it got more or less accurately answered by at least 10 people in the comments. I wanted to know if ethanol ingestion affected the lipolysis rate. It does.

This means that the NAD wil become NADH+H+, which then delivers the electrons to the mitochondria of the liver cells (and since the liver uses energy at a constant level, one CANNOT speed up the catabolism of alcohol by doing excercise as some people belive - just FYI). \nThe liver cells does only have a limited amount of NAD available. This means, that if it all is used for burning the alcohol the metabolism of the liver will be impaired in multiple reactions, which needs NAD to run. This means that the reactions will tend to be pushed towards the side where NAD is deprotonated (think of this as if the reactions are working against very high concentrations of NADH and therefore will be pushed backwards.) \nThis in turn means, that the beta oxidation (fat burn) won't work because you get NADH out of it, and the reaction between DHAP and Glycerol-3-p will be pushed towards glycerol-3-p.\nLong story short, the liver won't be able to produce glucose to put into the blood. This results in a drop in blood glucose and therefore a rise in glucagon (and the lipolysis in the adipocytes gets activated. Yes is the answer to your edit-question). This might be the reason why burgers and pommes are pleasant in the late hours.\nThe increased lipolysis actually leads more fatty acids to the liver even though plenty of fat is already there. The liver will try to send the fat back yo the adipocytes. The adipocytes don't want it, and this results in a rise in fat in the blood. BTW, it can actually be measured that the liver get \"fatty\" during drinking acutely. Alcohol damages the liver from the first drop you consume.\n\nI hope that this helps. Feel free to ask further into the stuff if you want. I'll do my best to answer.",

Somewhat coincidentally, the metabolism of alcohol also generates NADH, so the consumption of alcohol makes the liver incorrectly detect a well-fed state.\n\nIn this fake well-fed state, the liver stops producing new glucose (because it thinks the body has just been fed) leading to low blood sugar, and starts making new fat (increasing fat tissue). This is also why alcoholics develop fatty livers and eventual cirrhosis/liver failure. \nAnother interesting fact is that chronic alcohol use is associated with decreased circumference of your upper arm, leading to flabby biceps!",

Here's an explanation of the mechanism underlying this issue. It sounds like it is due to changes in lipolysis as well as reactive oxidative species (ROS) damage.\n \nhttp://www.clevelandclinicmeded.com/medicalpubs/diseasemanagement/hepatology/alcoholic-liver-disease/\n\nPathophysiology\nThe liver and, to a lesser extent, the gastrointestinal tract, are the main sites of alcohol metabolism. Within the liver there are 2 main pathways of alcohol metabolism: alcohol dehydrogenase and cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 2E1. Alcohol dehydrogenase is a hepatocyte cytosolic enzyme that converts alcohol to acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde subsequently is metabolized to acetate via the mitochondrial enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. CYP 2E1 also converts alcohol to acetaldehyde.4\n\nLiver damage occurs through several interrelated pathways. Alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase cause the reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH (reduced form of NAD). The altered ratio of NAD/NADH promotes fatty liver through the inhibition of gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. CYP 2E1, which is upregulated in chronic alcohol use, generates free radicals through the oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to NADP.4 Chronic alcohol exposure also activates hepatic macrophages, which then produce tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).5 TNF-alpha induces mitochondria to increase the production of reactive oxygen species. This oxidative stress promotes hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis, which is exaggerated in the alcoholic who is deficient in antioxidants such as glutathione and vitamin E. Free radicals initiate lipid peroxidation, which causes inflammation and fibrosis. Inflammation is also incited by acetaldehyde that, when bound covalently to cellular proteins, forms adducts that are antigenic.4",

What ends up occurring that as a result your TCA cycle is actually shut down - if you can't oxidize, it stops running. Because of the buildup of NADH that occurs from the oxidation, gluconeogenesis stops, and your blood glucose level drops (another cause of hangovers!). Therefore, your body starts releasing fats from adipose tissues.\n\nThis is bad, because you can't oxidize the fat to get energy out of it! So the fat gets deposited in your liver and sits there. So then you start getting fatty liver, which eventually leads to cirrhosis, and then you die*\n\n(*disclaimer - you really have to be an alcoholic to get to that extreme of a level; the fat can be removed should it build up in small quantities from occasional binge drinking)\n\nSo yes it does reduce the lipolysis rate, but it is not increasing fat storage in the way you're asking\n\nsource: i double checked a biochem textbook and also i have a degree in this kinda crap",

For one, there isn't a well defined mechanism by which booze leads to a beer belly but generally accepted that it does. Ethanol also called alcohol is metabolized into acetyl-coa which is the precursor molecule for synthesizing fat. Since ethanol is ONLY able to become acetyl-coa it must become fat or be used for energy those are the primary fates. Sugar in the other hand has more options it can be used for anabolism such as building amino acids or made into glycogen and it can enter the bloodstream and be transported more readily to other parts of the body whereas ethanol processed in the liver into fat tends to stay in the belly area. \n\nAka I am saying that the reason alcohol makes fat is because it must be terminally made into fat if not used immediately in TCA.    Moreover because of the molecular structure alcohol, roughly, is equivalent to its weight in fat. This means that when comparing a fatty drink like milk (normally 3.5% fat by volume but also sold in 2% and 1% varieties for waist watchers) pales in comparison to alcoholic beverages like beer ranging from 1-7% ethanol wine, 13% usually and whiskey, 40%usually.   \n\nAlthough metabolic pathway interactions are likely the simplest explanation for ethanols role in fat building is just that it is \npreferentially made into fat.  \n\nAnd ps: yes there are intermediates like acetylaldehyde that are detoxified to acetyl-coa. Another fun fact aspartame in diet soda has a methanol and formaldehyde intermediate which is even more toxic yet.",

Idk it seems like she’s trying to present as like a healthy purist persona but unfortunately for her nobody gives af 😭. \n\nIn that screenshot she highlights citric acid as an “unclean” ingredient….. poor girl doesn’t even know what that is (you can make it from lemon juice, it’s very easily naturally derived). Also calcium chloride is just… salt, like it’s in some waters as added electrolytes…\n\nAnyway I realize this is extremely random and chronically online, just thought I’d share some more lore ",

You can make it very lemony, or sweet, or just leave it a floral and herbal elixir - all according to your preferences.\n\nThis time of year, May going into June, is the perfect time to gather the flowers of the elderberry plant to make this tasty drink.  Later in the year, its delicate and sophisticated flavor and aroma really does change dramatically, so the time is now!\n\nElderflower Kvas is made under a similar methodology as the other kinds of Kvas; while it takes very little time to set up the fermentation of Elderflower Kvas, all those little yeast guy do require several days to work their magic - but that's okay because we have a little while to go until the height of summer anyway! :)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# How to Make Elderflower Kvas\n\n[Elderflower Kvas being strained before bottling.  Source: Смачна кухня on YouTube.](https://preview.redd.it/tfrt112ktoza1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6ecbfbb683e737b6f046fde173013d648251667)\n\n*Disclosure: As with any magic potion worth making, one needs to be extremely careful when handling the ingredients.  There are parts of the Elderberry plant that can be toxic to humans, so please please do some research before you go out foraging.  Roots, seeds and stems can be dangerous.  In this recipe, we are strictly dealing with the flowers only.*\n\n**Some Tips**\n\n* In order for you to get a delicious drink, collect only fresh elder blossoms.  Do not harvest plants near tracks and roads - they may contain a high concentration of toxic substances.  It is better to collect the flowers for kvas in dry weather - in such conditions there is more nectar in the flowers, unlike on a cloudy day.\n* During the preparation of kvas, you will see fermentation - this is wild yeast that is on the surface of the flowers. The yeast should not be washed off.  If you are worried that the drink will not ferment, you can add store-bought yeast.  Note that if you do that, the fermentation period is reduced by 2 days from the period specified in the recipe below.\n* Sometimes it happens that elderflower kvas turns out to be too thick.  There are several potential reasons for this:  You added yeast and it was the wrong type; the temperature during kvas fermentation was too high; there was too much yeast.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**The below recipe is from the YouTube channel Смачна кухня (\"Tasty Cuisine\").  We translated her video, and uploaded it to YouTube because autotranslate was disabled on her video.  I will put a link to both her original video and the translated one in the comments!**\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* Water: 5 liters, at room temperature\n* Sugar: 500 grams\n* Elderberry inflorescence (the complete flower heads): 20 to 25 - do not wash as you will remove wild yeast!\n* Citric acid: 2 tea spoons \\[Editor's note: or add lemon juice to taste\\]\n\n**Recipe**\n\n1. **Make sure you use only the flowers!**  Remove stems as much as possible (see the video!) and do a sweep for bugs :)\n2. Mix water with sugar until sugar completely dissolves.\n3. Mix the citric acid (or lemon juice) into the sugar water.\n4. Add inflorescence of elderberry and mix well again.\n5. Cover it with cheese cloth and leave it to ferment for 3 days. Stir it twice a day!\n6. After 3 days, strain it using a couple layers of cheese cloth nestled in a colander.\n7. After that - add it into capped bottles. Do not fill them to the top!  Kvas fermentation needs room to swirl :)\n8. Keep the bottles in a cool dark place for 4-5 days.\n9. Store kvas in the refrigerator - the kvas should be good to drink for a few months.\n10. Be careful when opening as it may pop like champagne!\n\n\\[Editor's note: It is quite common to add extra lemon zest before fermenting, or even add a little lemon juice and extra sugar before bottling.\\]\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 445th day of a nine year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n# 🇺🇦 HEROYAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Verified Charities\n\n* [**u/Jesterboyd**](https://www.reddit.com/u/Jesterboyd/) is a mod for [**r/ukraine**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/) and local to Kyiv.

We caused devastation and turned entire regions into wastelands. How is it that every other species seemed to avoid that amount of suffering?”\n\nThe alien looks down at the human’s drink, Jack and coke he called it. A concoction of literal flavored poison made of ethanol, natural pesticide called caffeine, and enough citric acid to make it a good rust remover.    \n\nAlien: “I’m surprised it’s not obvious”\n\nThe human looks startled, and considering humans, especially recreationally poisoned humans, have a reputation, he continued.\n\nAlien: “you’re species can loose limbs, drink poison for fun, you might not have scales or armor, but you can keep going until even after severe trauma, physical and mental. Broken bones, blood loss, severe illness, anyone of these would kill outright any other species, And climate extremes mean nothing to you”\n\n“and you pack bond heavily, so much so that you would die, and even more easily kill, for the safety of that pack. Now when you add those two together you can turn your entire world into a hellscape to save your pack, and survive in the process”\n\nAlien took a pause, and came up with a thesis for it's paper: “Every sentient species has a upper limit of conflict they can handle before it kills out the population, for most species that’s around when chemically powered weapons like guns get invented. After that, Mutually assured destruction for everyone involved in the conflict” picking up a term he heard in the human society of the late industrial revolution, itself a human specific event.\n\n“so it took the use of nuclear weapons, weapons that cause the very ground to turn to glass, and create radioactive particles to shower on the land. It took the habitability of the entire planet, your entire habitable area, before you hit the upper limit of conflict.  ",

It won't use a ton, but it is progress.\n\nJust mix 97 grams of baking soda and 74 grams of citric acid in 125 grams of water in a non reactive pot. Wait for the reaction to completely finish, this can take a couple of hours and the pot will get pretty cold during the reaction. It makes CO2 and water, just like vinegar and baking soda, but leaves behind a solution of sodium citrate. Boil off the water to get powdered sodium citrate.\n\nTo make use of it, warm a small amount of milk, water, beer, or your base of choice. Weigh out the cheese you plan on melting and dissolve approx 2 to 3 percent of that weight to the warmed liquid. Then just add the cheese in small chunks, stirring to incorporate it. It melts like velveeta, but tastes of real cheese.\n\n[Or you can try some Mac and cheese](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/11/sodium-citrate-baked-mac-and-cheese.html)",

I'm posting to share my favorite bath time ingredients, and get suggestions for other bath time ingredients from the community. Here are the ingredients I use and what I use them for: \n\nDead Sea Salt- To moisturize, reduce inflammation, and nourish skin.\n\nEpsom Salt- To ease sore muscles and cramps.\n\nCitric Acid- To cleanse without soap, brighten skin, and prevent yeast infection.\n\nApple Cider Vinegar- To cleanse without soap, prevent yeast infection, and add micro-nutrients.\n\nVitamin E- To moisturize and nourish dry winter skin.\n\nOatmeal- To remove allergens and excess body oil, ease inflammation, and moisturize.\n\nTHC oil- For a super relaxing body-high.\n\n I don't use all of these ingredients at once. I usually mix two or three together to get the results I'm looking for. I always use either vinegar or citric acid to reduce the pH of my alkaline tap water and prevent infection. \n\nWhat do you use?   ",

I thought it was just decorative, but no, in hot water the oils seep out of the petals and leave skin feeling silky.

I went to the one in Copenhagen but they have a couple in the states too, I think Chicago and NY, and several other locations across Europe. You guys… the room was a converted cellar with a stone tub and the bath water was blood red. The redness comes from Spanish Ribera Del Duero grapes. They did a jasmine scented hair mask and scalp massage, served me a glass of red wine and I got to enjoy the bottle throughout the salt pools the rest of the evening. The entire place was lit by candlelight and I got a merlot colored suede bath robe (everyone else’s is white teri so you feel like the fucking priestess). Chocolates, fresh grapes and Manchego cheese. The building is a 400yr old brewery with two giant stone elephants at the entrance and mountains of salt next to turquoise limestone pools.. I died.

    "body": "**Starmer doesn’t understand. We’re human, risk is what we do**\n\nBy **Jeremy Clarkson** (*The Sunday Times*, Sept. 01)\n\nEvery year, in the Spanish town of Buñol, there’s a festival where people turn up and throw tomatoes at one another. It all began after the war, when a food fight broke out, and it sort of grew from there to a point where, nowadays, more than 20,000 people turn up.\n\nRecently, however, a woman covering the event for a local television station had her bottom pinched, which I’m sure was degrading. As a result, the organisers decided to ensure the incident would never be repeated by creating so-called “purple safe spaces”, where participants who felt they were in danger could take refuge.\n\nI’m not sure this will work, though, because at La Tomatina, there are no safe spaces. I took part 22 years ago and it’s still etched in my memory as the “worst day of my life”.\n\nIt begins with a group of young men attempting to climb a freshly greased pole so they may knock a perfectly good ham to the ground. And when it falls, it’s a green light for a procession of trucks to make its way through the town, depositing 135 tonnes of tomatoes into the streets. These are then picked up by the extremely boisterous crowd, who hurl them at one another.\n\nSounds like fun, yes? Well, it isn’t. You’re told that the tomatoes are ripe and consequently very squishy, and some of them are. But others are as hard as potatoes and when you get one of those in the face, you know about it. But there’s nothing you can do because you are hemmed in on all sides by the crowd and you are 6ft 5in tall, so you are sticking out like a sunflower in a field of cress.\n\nYou’re hit again and again, and then again. And then someone tears your shirt off. And you can’t see who because by this stage the goggles you wore as a precaution have been knocked off and you are blind.\n\nTomatoes are in my top three list of favourite foods. I like very much to put them in my mouth. But one of the reasons they taste so good is because they are full of citric acid. And you really don’t want to put that in your eyes, because then you aren’t able to see anything.\n\n[I recently read a book](https://www.reddit.com/r/thegrandtour/comments/1ewev0r/clarksons_columns_my_favourite_books_racist/) called *The Forgotten Soldier*. It’s about the life of German soldiers on the eastern front as they retreated in the face of the relentless Soviet advance. The author, Guy Sajer, makes an excellent job of conveying how it felt when the air was literally full of projectiles and everyone was being hit.\n\nI’m not suggesting, of course, that a good-natured festival in a small summertime Spanish town is in any way comparable, and yet, somehow I am. It’s awful. You’re getting elbowed and shoved. You can’t see a thing. Your eyes hurt like hell and you have no idea which way is up. And all the time another potato travelling at 40mph is heading towards the side of your head. And you can’t see it coming. God knows how anyone could tell their bottom was being pinched. They could have sodomised me with a hatstand out there and I wouldn’t have noticed.\n\nWhen it was all over, I wondered out loud, for quite some time, why on earth such a festival still takes place. Because who wants to be stripped half-naked, pelted with rocks and blinded? For fun? But then I remembered that closer to home we have the annual cheese-rolling festival in Gloucestershire. Here, a group of young men and women see who can break their legs in the most spectacular fashion while running down a hill. It’s a commentator’s dream: “Oh my God, the femur has snapped completely and his hip has come out of his left buttock!!”\n\nIn Italy there’s a festival in which the locals spend all year tending to their oranges before meeting up to chuck them at each other. And in an Indian village called Kairuppala, they celebrate the Hindu new year by meeting up and doing the same sort of thing, only with cow dung.\n\nThey really do. And you need to remember that cow dungs share many properties with Spanish tomatoes. Some are soft and squishy and burst on impact, propelling ruminant juice into your mouth, ears, eyes and nostrils. And some are hard, so they hurt — before bursting and propelling ruminant juice into your mouth, ears, eyes and nostrils.\n\nStrange, isn’t it? In much of India, it is illegal to eat meat from a cow. And yet there are thousands of people there who meet up every year to feast on its faeces.\n\nAnd this is what Sir Keir Starmer’s forces of socialism never seem to understand about humanity. We know that ravens like to snowboard down snowy roofs for fun, and we know dolphins enjoy surfing in just-about-to-break waves. But for the most part, animals are happy to live in a communistical world where you do nothing but sleep and search for food.\n\nHumans are different. We like excitement. We like danger. I can’t imagine Judi Dench would enjoy the tomato festival, and I know I didn’t, but thousands of others do. And it’s the same story with that town where young men sign up to be chased through the streets by two tonnes of horned testosterone. And then meet up afterwards, for a beer and a laugh and maybe a smoke.\n\nDriving at more than 20mph in a car that roars. Teasing your mates. Jumping into the river after your exam results. Drinking a whole bottle of wine at lunchtime. Taking a speedboat ride. Shooting a rabbit. Being four and getting pushed really hard on a swing. Hanging around with your mates in a graveyard with a bottle of cider and a packet of rolling tobacco. Putting up a conservatory and hoping the planners don’t notice, making a joke on social media, sunbathing with no factor 50, eating meat, and sitting around a log fire on cold winter evenings. That’s who we are. And that’s what he wants to take away.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\\[Note: I know the piece below has already been posted here as an archive link, but if anyone wants to read it again, here it is in full. I also wanted to make up for the weakness of Clarkson's column above.\\]\n\n**Two decades of Top Gear and The Grand Tour — by Clarkson, Hammond and May**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z7w6m4gzahmd1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5c4a3832cf2c17cf70e4a5d53fe2d3fe8d6e833c\n\n*After 22 years together, Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May have reached their final destination. They reflect on silly stunts, near-death experiences, an unlikely TV triumph — and their even unlikelier friendship* (*The Sunday Times*, Sept. 01)\n\n**Jeremy Clarkson, 64**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/87eh7uf4bhmd1.jpg?width=1022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=83fad4c17830fbace30c292aaed54fba780ff831\n\nThe story, if you’re in a bit of a hurry, is as follows. In 1986 I sat next to a *Top Gear* producer at the launch of the Citroën AX. He offered me a job and two years later I started to appear on screen. I did that for a while, got ideas above my station, left, and made some mostly forgettable programmes before dreaming up a new format for *Top Gear*. I then did that, got fired, started *The Grand Tour* with Amazon and now, after 36 years of talking about cars on television, I’m packing it in, because I’m too old and fat to get into the cars that I like and not interested in driving those I don’t.\n\nWhat this means of course is that my 22-year partnership with James May and Richard Hammond is now over. You can see our final road trip together on Amazon Prime very soon. It’s emotional.\n\nWhat makes the three of us happy, though, is how we ended it. Most people thought, with some justification, that we were bound to fly it at 500mph, in a blizzard of outrage and tabloid headlines, into a mountainside. But we didn’t. We landed it safely, and gently, on the salt pans in Botswana, thus finishing up back where we began… I wasn’t going to write about the helter skelter we’ve been on for most of our adult lives, but my editor at *The Sunday Times* thinks some people might be interested. So here goes.\n\nAfter I left the early incarnation of *Top Gear*, they tried out a number of replacements before alighting on a young boy with a pudding-basin haircut called James May. It pleases me to tell you that soon the audience figures began to dwindle until one day the show was canned.\n\nI then had an idea of how it might be brought back. We’d get an aircraft hangar that we would fill each week with petrolheads and snazzy new cars, and then outside we’d create a track on the airfield where someone would see how fast the snazzy new cars would go. Someone? It took me a while to figure this out. Obviously I needed a racing driver, but racing drivers tend only to be interested in differentials and big watches. So what if I got one who did the driving, never took his helmet off and never said a thing? All we wanted was the lap time and that’s all we’d get. The presenters would explain what the car was like, and then the professional driver would take it to its limits.\n\nAnother idea was that we’d have a celebrity each week who would see how fast he or she (there were no theys then) could get round the track we’d made. And I came up with the idea of the Reasonably Priced Car because I thought it would be funny to see a fully tuxedoed Bryan Ferry in such a thing. Weirdly, we never got Bryan to do it. Tom Cruise did. And Cameron Diaz. And Will Smith and Mark Wahlberg. But Bryan? He always said no, sadly.\n\nSelling all of these ideas to the BBC was not easy. So one day my producer, Andy Wilman, and I worked out that Jane Root, the BBC2 controller, would be at a party in a Bentley showroom in Mayfair. Those were the days when the BBC was fun. So we sat down, explained the idea and she was baffled. And she kept on being baffled until, in desperation, I said, “It’s a place where car things happen.” She got that and *Top Gear* 2.0 was born. Today I know of 432 BBC people who say they commissioned the record-breaking phenomenon that *Top Gear* was to become, but the fact is this: it was Jane Root. She’s a superstar.\n\nGetting the show started was also not easy. The British countryside is littered with seemingly disused airfields, but when you go to the Ministry of Defence to ask if you could maybe rent one of them, the answer’s always the same. “’Fraid not, old chap. We need it for parachute training/glider practice/storage etc. And besides, if Jerry needs a punch on the nose again, it wouldn’t do if we couldn’t land our kites because Richard Madeley was driving along the runway in a Suzuki Liana.”\n\nEventually Andy found Dunsfold in Surrey, which was close to where all the celebrities lived. It also had miles of smooth tarmac and several hangars, and it didn’t belong to the MoD. So he did the deal and we were away. Nearly. Because we needed two other presenters. Three’s the right number because two people can always gang up on the third. That way, someone was always being bullied. Screen tests gave us Richard Hammond and a chap called Jason Dawe, and there we were: ready to go.\n\nIn its heyday we were cramming upwards of 800 people into that hangar — 300 more than the council permitted. And still there was a waiting list for tickets that was 18 years long. But it didn’t start out like that. In the first season Andy was using his own money to bribe audience members to stay to the end. The TV viewing figures weren’t that great either, so it was decided that we needed a new presenter. But who? The BBC had all sorts of politically correct ideas on this, but I wanted the man with the pudding-bowl haircut who had driven the first incarnation of *Top Gear* into the ground. I thought his hair was funny. It still is. I don’t think he understood the show at all and I’m damn certain he never understood what it became, but sticking to my guns on James was, as it turned out, the right thing to do. One day he’ll probably say thank you.\n\nEven with James on board things didn’t really pick up, but then one day, in September 2006, at Elvington airfield in Yorkshire, Richard started a new hobby. Going upside down while traveling at extremely high speed.\n\nI was told about his crash as I was driving round Hammersmith roundabout, and it didn’t seem like he was too badly injured. They’d got him out of the car and he’d tried to do a piece to camera. Plucky little f\\*\\*\\*er, as always. But then one of the crew noticed his eyes weren’t really pointing in the same direction, so off to hospital he went.\n\nI woke the next morning, turned on the TV and couldn’t quite believe what I was hearing. Richard Hammond was in a critical condition. I arrived at the hospital about seven minutes later, where I met Mindy, his long-suffering but very stoic wife, James, Andy and various BBC wallahs. Richard was in a bad way. He might not live and if he did he might be a drooling vegetable.\n\nIt took six months for him to come back to work, and were there any long-term effects? Yes, if I’m honest. Two things. His memory is shot and his epic crash propelled *Top Gear* to the centre of the stage and then, with an almighty clang, into the orchestra pit.\n\nPeople started watching in large numbers, and while many enjoyed our refusal to subscribe to what was then called political correctness, some found it irritating when we used expressions such as, for instance, “drooling vegetable”. Which meant that pretty soon *Top Gear* wasn’t the show that bloody nearly killed Richard Hammond. It was the show that sat in the BBC schedules like a big blue skid mark. It became a dartboard for the left. I’ll be honest with you. Richard doesn’t like being in trouble, so he hated the constant attacks. And I suspect James found some of the goings on uncomfortable as well. But I love being in trouble, so I was very happy. Andy’s the same. We went to the same school and all we learnt there is how to get into trouble, and then how to get out of it.\n\nIt came in handy. Sometimes we pleaded innocence. Sometimes we flat-out lied. And sometimes we argued that, in the big scheme of things, we hadn’t been that bad. In our minds we never were. We were just naughty schoolkids trying to annoy our lefty BBC bosses. Who, to us, were the teachers. It was fun. They’d say every week, “You can’t say that,” and we’d reply, “Er, you can, actually. We know this because we just did.” We never won a Bafta. I don’t think we were ever even nominated.\n\nBehind the schoolboy naughtiness, though, *Top Gear* was a very well-made programme. As a general rule the shooting ratio for British television is 12:1. You shoot twelve hours for every hour you show. The rest ends up on the cutting room floor. With Attenborough this goes up to something like 500:1. The cameras shoot a lot of snow before the polar bear emerges. But *Top Gear*’s ratio was 1,200:1. As Andy used to say, “That’s how shit you three are. I have to throw away 1,199 hours of you talking drivel to find one hour where you’re not.”\n\nThe amazing thing, though, is that Andy really would watch all of the rushes. And there was a similar attention to detail with how the show was constructed. If we thought we had a funny scene, we’d put a funny visual joke in there as well. And then something weird in the back of shot. Like a picture of Peter Bowles. Maybe only one person ever spotted these things. But that was enough to make the effort worthwhile.\n\nBut then it really did all get too much. I was even accused of racism by a BBC boss because my son, a devoted Chelsea fan, had called his new Scottie dog Didier Dogba. The show had blasted into the *Guinness Book of Records* for being the most popular programme in the world. And we had the *Top Gear Live* show as well. So I’d plan the TV show on Monday, write it on Tuesday, record it on Wednesday and then be on stage on Thursday night in Johannesburg. Or Oslo. Or Budapest. I became frantic and possessed and mad and I was fired.\n\nAnd then along came Amazon, who noticed that every single person involved in the world’s biggest show was suddenly available. So we called the Hothouse Flowers, came up with the biggest, most flamboyant show opening we could afford — and we could afford a lot with Amazon behind us — and started all over again.\n\nIt was harder on *The Grand Tour* because there were no lefty bosses to annoy. Amazon’s “teachers” were more laid-back. I’d say something that would have got me into hot water at the Beeb, and there’d be no response. It was like trying to annoy a lawn.\n\nIn the big wide world, though, things were changing. Political correctness was now called “wokery” and it was organised. Huge marauding gangs were patrolling the internet waiting to pounce on anyone who refused to subscribe to their doctrine. In the past you could be fired. Now you could be cancelled. So we put away the tent that had become our new home and went back to doing what we liked most of all: buying three terrible old cars and seeing if we could drive them over gruesome terrain to somewhere idiotic.\n\nThese were known as “specials”. The first, in *Top Gear* days, was an accident. We wanted to see if we could buy a car in America for less than it would cost to rent one. But the item we made, replete with a bloated dead cow on a Camaro’s roof, was so long we made it into a whole show.\n\nIt was well received, so we then decided to do one on purpose. I’d just been on holiday to Botswana, where someone had told me that no one had ever driven across the Makgadikgadi salt pans. So we bought an Opel, a Lancia and a Mercedes and did just that. This remains my favourite special.\n\nBut there are others that I remember with fondness too. Searching for the source of the Nile was one, and driving through Iraq, Turkey, Syria, Jordan and Israel to find the birthplace of the baby Jesus is another. I did not enjoy driving to the North Pole, nor the accusations that I’d been drinking a gin and tonic while driving. I wasn’t driving. It was a frozen ocean, so I was sailing. Get into trouble and then get out of it.\n\nPatagonia was no fun either because of that number plate thing. We were in terrible trouble for that and this pisses me off for two reasons. 1) It — H982 FKL — really was an accident and 2) I wish I’d thought of it. I feel lazy that I didn’t.\n\nWe thought long and hard about how we should end our 22-year partnership, but in the end we just went to the end of the alphabet. Zimbabwe. We’d always wanted to go but never could in the olden days because the BBC was, and still is, banned. Plus, all three of us absolutely love being in Africa. Which is why we’ve done specials over the years in Namibia, Botswana, Mozambique, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Mauritania. It’s our happy place.\n\nThere was another reason why we chose Zimbabwe, though. We would drive across it from east to west, as usual, but then we could cross the border and finish up where we began all those years ago: the Makgadikgadi salt pans in Botswana.\n\nWas it sad when the director called, “That’s a wrap,” for the very last time? Yes, it was. Especially as some of the crew had been with us when we were there before. People think of *Top Gear* and *The Grand Tour* as being James, Richard and me. But it isn’t. We’ve had the same crews for years. We’ve all grown up together. We’ve camped together. Shat our lungs out together, laughed our arses off together. Casper, Ben, Russ, Kit, Marky Mark, Steve, Toby, Catweazle and a load more besides. These are the guys who really made those shows. They’re the ones who kept the cameras and the microphones going even when it was cold or dangerous, so that Andy had his 1,200 hours of material to sift through.\n\nBut I can’t say it was much of a wrench when our juggernaut came to a halt because, two days later, I was with the same guys again making the farm show.\n\nRichard and James: will I miss them? Not really. I can see them whenever I like. But what I will miss is the excitement of crawling into a city such as Harare or La Paz or Hanoi at three in the morning in a car with no headlamps, one gear and only three wheels.\n\nI never thought I could have a job that would let me do stuff like that. There wasn’t a job that allowed me to do stuff like that. We invented it. And I hope that whoever replaces us realises that while they’ll get several diseases and arrested and bashed about until they are just a walking bruise, they are the luckiest people on earth.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n**James May, 61**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/352bsmxmchmd1.jpg?width=1022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0a929ef83d1a756bfd2936787064ed6d87bc069f\n\nIf I were one of those people who likes to embarrass his friends by talking about the “weird dream” I had last night, I would have only to pluck at random from those I’ve had about the adventures of the past 20 years. Sample: I’m in a convertible Ferrari surrounded by boulders of ice trying to get to a hospital at the North Pole to see how Richard Hammond is doing after his latest crash. Or I’m driving a beach buggy to Scotland, where I camp in a desert and threaten to kill Jeremy Clarkson with a machete. Once I was in a boat that was sinking and someone had given me a plate of fried grasshoppers to eat. I could see Lake Victoria in the distance and a local man was talking to me in Norwegian.\n\nThe two-decade continuous road trip that was *Top Gear* and *The Grand Tour* has taken up a third of my life to date. Not even education managed that. The longest that I held down any other job was a few years. How did this happen? I came from a background of magazine and newspaper journalism, writing mainly about cars but also travel and technology. That was a good start. Clarkson’s background was similar, although he’d already been on the haunted fish tank for years. Hammond came via local radio and cable TV — and a brief foray into automotive public relations in the late 1990s. He doesn’t like to be reminded of that, so I’m reminding him here.\n\nWhat united us from the start was a genuine love of our subject, no matter how much we liked to deny and disguise it, and that we were all middle-aged white men and therefore deeply unfashionable. We became increasingly unfashionable, and so did the object of our affections, the car. Back in 2003, when things such as climate change hadn’t really been invented yet, cars were still objects of desire and aspiration; now they are widely vilified. We started in an era when a mobile phone was for making phone calls, but ended up Bluetoothing them to touchscreens to find our way across the distant lands that were our playground.\n\nWhat didn’t really change was the trio of blokes at the wheel. The tall one suffering from terminal hyperbole, the short one squeaking excitedly and the one with the terrible hair trying to be reasonable. I’m regularly asked about the secret of “the chemistry” and, to be honest, I’ve never really understood it. I often say that if we’d been at the same school in the same year we’d have been in different gangs; grudgingly respectful of each other but openly disdainful. I cannot imagine being either of the other two; cannot conceive of being possessed by Clarkson’s bombosity (a word I just made up) or Hammond’s enthusiasm for being removed from his own clothes with scissors. But it made for good company and what, in other lines of employment, would be called a “stimulating working environment”. We get on each other’s nerves but we’re not Fleetwood Mac, and now we no longer have the stimulus of a completely consuming working life together, we might even socialise once in a while.\n\nThe best bits? A few stand out and comfort me in quiet moments, such as a drive alone across the dunes of Namibia at sunset. Seeing the magic number 400km/h appear on the dash of the Bugatti Veyron I tested in Germany to prove that Captain Slow could push the world’s fastest production car to its limit. The relief that Hammond was not dead after all. But really the entire canon of *Top Gear* and *The Grand Tour* plays in my mind like one of our own montages, full of incredible scenery, noise, excitement, huge laughter, missed flights, horrible packed lunches and abysmal camping. Strangely I have kept very few souvenirs, just the beach buggy and the canvas shoulder bag I bought in the first year of filming, which has been with me ever since. It has embedded in it the dust of an entire planet, and it’s enough. But it will be hard to settle down to a couple of modest holidays a year after two decades of global adventuring.\n\nVital to our success were the crew, who made us look and sound better than we actually were. It’s humbling to think that all those people worked for the net result of three blokes talking bollocks on the box. Our producer, Andy Wilman, too, for editing tens of thousands of hours of drivel into comprehensible stories. And you, the viewers; our ultimate responsibility and the reason we decided to stick together, once, following a bit of a scene.\n\nMust it end? It must. We’ve exhausted our take on the subject, and we always promised ourselves that we’d land our legacy safely instead of flying it into a cliff. And we’re old now. I set off as a puffy-faced youth with lustrous long dark hair that seemed to be permanently tousled by a warm zephyr, believing I’d landed a gig that might last a couple of years. I parked up grey, stooped, with a bad back, looking for my glasses so I could write this down. I regret none of it; none of those 20-plus years of beige food and bad living. It was tremendous. Thank you for watching.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Richard Hammond, 54**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a836kgk7dhmd1.jpg?width=1022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=516dd9666e7da204cafd2a721052c38783775de7\n\nYou live your life forwards but it only really makes sense when you look at it backwards. Being on *Top Gear* changed everything for me. Before that I’d had a haphazard series of jobs. I was a presenter on local radio up north. I worked in the Renault press office. Then I started doing a Granada TV show called *Men & Motors*. It was incredibly low-budget but incredibly good experience because it made you think on your feet.\n\nThere was me and my mate Stan, who worked the camera. Stan had one bag with his camera, microphone and spare socks and pants. We’d set off, travelling light, and cover a car launch. One day my agent rang me and said, “Rich, they’re relaunching *Top Gear*, you’ve got an audition. I don’t think you’ll get it, but you should go because they’re useful people to meet.”\n\nSo I drove down to London and met Richard Porter (the script editor), Andy Wilman (the executive producer) and, of course, Jeremy. I had a brilliant time at the audition and loved it. Afterwards my agent’s words — “you’re never going to get it” — were ringing in my ears and I thought: they’re going to do a great show, it’s just a shame I won’t be part of it.\n\nMonths passed. I was married by then to Mindy, who I’d met at Renault. She’d given up work and we were expecting a baby. We’d bought a little place in Cheltenham. They were lean times, but I was never home long enough to realise how broke we were. We were sitting in the damp basement when the phone rang. I said, “Mindy, that’s them, I know it is.”\n\nI answered and it was Gary Hunter, one of the BBC execs, who said, “We’d like you to join our team,” and I burst into tears. We opened a bottle of champagne, even though it was only 11 in the morning, sat on the wall in our little backyard and celebrated. Even then I thought: the show will run for a couple of series. I didn’t think for a second I’d still be with the same team more than 20 years later. I was lucky I slotted in well. There was room for a small, irritating one.\n\nAt the start, in 2002, we planned a different type of show to the one it eventually became. There would be no exotic supercars and no exotic locations. We would show only cars that people could actually buy in places they would really go. We struggled to get enough people even to make up an audience at Dunsfold, our makeshift studio. Fairly quickly we learnt that people wanted to see us having fun. I remember the episode we did on cheap Italian supercars. We pulled up at a petrol station, I think it was near Winchester, and a small crowd gathered. There was a sense of a stupid circus being in town. We realised, “Hang on, we’re a thing.”\n\nThen there was my jet car crash in 2006. A tyre burst at 300mph and I careered out of control and landed upside down in a field. Apparently I tried to do a piece to camera afterwards but I’ve no memory. I sustained a frontal lobe brain injury. It did have a knock-on effect. I’ve discussed it since with my family. I’m 54 and my memory’s getting shaky. The crash boosted our viewing figures — undoubtedly so. It helped humanise us beyond being car reporters.\n\nAnother thing that gave us a leg-up was when our broadcast slot moved from Thursday to Sunday night. That brought us a wider audience and we became a fixture in people’s week. Then again *Top Gear* was never really a show about cars. It was about three blokes making a show about cars. It scratched some of the laddish itch, but we weren’t laddy. Women watched us as well as men. We got to a stage where if we forgot our lines or cocked up a stunt, everyone was delighted because that’s exactly what they wanted to see. In a weird way at that point we couldn’t lose. But we always believed in what we were doing. An audience can sniff it out if it’s not authentic. Every discussion between us was driven by passion. It still is. We really did care about the difference between oversteer and understeer, and four-wheel and two-wheel drive and 50-50 weight distribution — all of those things.\n\nIn 2007 we did our first proper, full-size special — the Botswana film. We upped the production values, and all of a sudden we realised, shit, we can make shows about cars and they can look beautiful as well, with fantastic shots of wildlife and scenery. It all just coalesced and came together.\n\nAll of us, the whole *Top Gear/Grand Tour* lot, have been living in an intense world for as long as I can remember. It has been one of the most important things in our lives. You don’t say goodbye to all that lightly. Perhaps you just savour the sadness. I totally did in the final *Grand Tour* episode, driving back across the desert to where we set off from in Botswana all those years ago. I was very fortunate to have been a part of all those adventures. I can’t claim I brought any massive talent to it. I was just happy to tag along. I’m a bloke from Birmingham who worked in local radio and trod on every luck mine I could have trodden on. I remember once, just before we went out in front of 62,000 people at the Polish national stadium in Warsaw to do *Top Gear Live*, I said to the lads, have three people with less talent ever gone out in front of a bigger crowd?\n\n*The Grand Tour: One for the Road launches on Prime Video on September 13*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zzray4xzdhmd1.jpg?width=1022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3cc1d3b209ddf7c0e26ef97c81a3ead392a83590\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\\[Note: While rummaging around *The Times* website I found the following article from last year, concerning Captain Slow\\]\n\n**What I've Learnt: James May** \n\n*Presenter James May, 60, worked as a motoring journalist before getting his break on* Top Gear*. He has fronted* The Grand Tour *on Prime Video with Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond since 2015. He lives in London with his partner, the dance critic Sarah Frater.*\n\nBy Georgina Roberts (*The Times*, July 14, 2023)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8n6gruvpehmd1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cb8209f7e076ac01ebd2d5336bcdba2c64df4298\n\nThere was no doing cocaine out of girls’ navels. We behaved quite badly at times doing Top Gear Live around the world and made a lot of noise, but it wasn’t as rock’n’roll as we liked to think it was. We just used to drink too much wine and beer, scream and shout at each other, trying to be the funniest person in the room. A lot of the time, we were having a snooze and a nice cup of tea.\n\nOne or two people think I’m evil and very self-obsessed. Or that I have a “Do you know who I am?” attitude. A lot of people claim to have met me or know somebody who knows me, when they obviously don’t, so I don’t let it worry me too much.\n\nI’ve eaten a bull’s penis, rotten shark, snake blood, grasshoppers. I’m not squeamish about food. We have had bouts of the shits — that was inevitable after all those journeys. But none of us has ever got dysentery or ebola; we’ve done remarkably well. Of course, there could be some terrible things lurking within me that I don’t know about.\n\nI was fired from jobs in my twenties because I was useless. I didn’t really know what I wanted to do. I was a dreamer who lacked ambition. I was partly useless because I wasn’t interested in what I was doing, working at a car dealership or the civil service. At *Autocar* magazine, I rewrote an acrostic to spell a message that basically said working there was a pain in the arse. Management was very, very angry about it.\n\nPart of the job is pretending to be less clever or less informed than we really are. We \\[May, Clarkson, Hammond\\] are reasonably liberal-minded, modern, forward-thinking people. We do ham it up. Please don’t think we’re entirely like that in real life.\n\nI try to buy nice clothes, but I make them look shit. I’m a strange shape. I’ve been unsure about my hair since I was 15. If I have it cut short I look ill, or like Valerie Singleton on Blue Peter in the Seventies. I don’t think anybody has ever watched my TV shows because of the way I look. We look appalling on *The Grand Tour*.\n\nIf Clarkson, Hammond and I were at school together, we wouldn’t have been mates. A lot of people imagine we live in a big house together with cars parked outside and a drum kit. We would have been in different gangs. Hammond would have been in something outdoorsy like scouting; I’d have been in something nerdy, reading poetry; Clarkson would have been in Young Farmers. But that’s why it works, because we’re always at loggerheads with one another.\n\nI was unhappy about turning 60. I was in my late thirties, then I was busy for a moment, then I was 60. I’m not as busy as I was ten years ago; I don’t have as much energy. Perhaps I’ve become complacent, or I’m just getting old. August is going to be my dry-run retirement — day trips, resting, woodwork, gardening, cooking, biking.\n\nI think there is a role for comedy sexism, comedy racism. It’s very difficult to do; you have to be a very skilled comedian. But there is a way of lampooning these things and parodying them in such a way that they become laughable. Then when people do it for real, it’s laughable rather than dangerous. I don’t set out to be offensive, but I recognise that we’re in an age of taking offence.\n\nOur rumoured *Grand Tour* salaries made me laugh because they were always wildly wrong. \\[May was rumoured to be paid £7.2 million.\\] We’ve certainly never talked about it; that would be vulgar and inappropriate. They even got my dad’s occupation wrong on Wikipedia. People think my dad was a priest but he’s actually a bit of an atheist.\n\nBuying half a pub was totally selfish. It was the only pub within walking distance of our weekend bolt-hole cottage in south Wiltshire. I do have an old Land Rover there, but I don’t dress in green and start shooting things. I thought, if the pub were turned into a house or shop, there wouldn’t be a pub within walking distance, and then life would become meaningless.\n\nA journalist once told me I’ve got terrible imposter syndrome. I thought, yes, you’re dead right. I’ve definitely got it — the fear of being found out and being exposed as a terrible fraud. Maybe I am one.\n\n***Little Experts: Marvellous Vehicles*** *by James May, published by Red Shed, is out now (£9.99)*\n\n*\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_*\n\nAnd here's [the Sun column](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/30177904/pub-keir-starmer-smoking-ban-jeremy-clarkson/).

No meals, no snacks, no calories (aside from some small ones I’ll get into), and I feel fantastic.\n\nLet’s start with the physical side of things. Since I began this extended fast on March 29th, I’ve lost about 26 pounds. That’s a little over a pound per day, consistently, without any effort. No gym, no cardio, just walking around doing life. My skin is glowing. My sleep has improved by about an hour per night on average. My energy levels are smooth and consistent throughout the day. I’m not crashing in the afternoon. I’m not jittery in the morning. I’m just... steady. If I needed to sprint or do high-intensity work, that’s probably not happening, but for everyday tasks, light movement, work, and focus, I’m doing great.\n\nWhen I first started this fast, my goal was just to make it to Day 5, that was my old record. (If you scroll through my earlier updates, you’ll see when I broke it.) Then, on Days 6 and 7, I was genuinely surprised. The hunger pangs that usually beg and plead for my attention were just... gone.\n\nI noticed something interesting: that frantic, distracting mental chatter your brain throws at you to eat, it just disappears. Food still looks and smells amazing, sure, but there’s this deep sense of not needing it. Like, I can look at a slice of pizza and think, “Yeah, that looks good,” but I don’t *need* to eat it. I’m fine without it.\n\nThe way our mind and body urge us to eat reminds me of a little kid in a grocery store, tugging on your arm, begging for a candy bar. At first, they’re relentless, whining, pleading, making a scene. But if you stay calm and just don’t give in, eventually the behavior fades. That’s exactly what it feels like. Ignore the noise long enough, and it quiets down.\n\nIt’s honestly blowing my mind that after 21+ days, I still feel fine. Everyone around me is shocked to see how normal I seem, knowing how deep I am into this fast. But that’s the thing, it becomes normal. The body adapts.\n\nIf I could change one person's mind reading this post, it would be this: after four days of fasting with no food, it gets so much easier. Don’t be one of those people who think they can’t fast as long as I’m fasting right now, I promise you, you can. Once your body fully switches to burning fat instead of glucose, the hunger pangs go away.\n\nI just spent Easter with my entire family, and they were eating some of the most savory, delicious food ever. And I didn’t feel even the slightest bit hungry.\n\nI’m not better than you. I’m not smarter than you. I don’t have better genetics than you. This is just biology. If you can push past four days, your hunger will go down, I promise you.\n\nJust make sure you do it safely, with electrolytes.\n\nLet me explain how I handle mine, and more importantly, *why* I do it this way.\n\nWhen you fast, especially beyond 48-72 hours, your insulin levels drop, and your kidneys begin dumping sodium and water at a rapid rate. That’s great for weight loss, but it means you’re going to need to intentionally replenish sodium, potassium, and magnesium, or you're going to feel awful. Most of the negative symptoms people associate with fasting (fatigue, lightheadedness, headaches, muscle cramps) are actually electrolyte imbalances.\n\nHere’s how I solve that:   \n(NOTE: CHECK THE COMMUNITY INFO ON THIS SUB AND READ THE ELECTROLYTE WIKI)\n\nFirst, I bought a precise kitchen scale from Amazon. Not your regular big cooking scale, but a gram-accurate espresso scale. This helps me dose out small amounts of powder with accuracy. Every morning, I grab a small cup, set it on the scale, tare it to zero, and pour in:\n\n* The recommended daily dose of **sodium** (via salt)\n* The daily dose of **potassium chloride powder** (this is critical, and a lot of people overlook it)\n\nThen I add a flavored **LMNT packet**, which contains:\n\n* 1000 mg sodium\n* 200 mg potassium\n* 60 mg magnesium\n* About 10 calories (from stevia leaf extract and citric acid)\n\nNow yes, these packets have about 10 calories, and yes, that would horrify the zero-calorie fasting purists. But I don’t care. These things make my electrolyte drink taste way better and make the whole process painless. It’s a tradeoff I’ll happily make.\n\nAnd honestly, I’d just remind anyone clutching their pearls over a flavored packet that I’m still losing a pound a day — *every single day* — without any effort. I feel great. I’m hitting all my recommended electrolytes. My body is clearly in deep fat-burning mode. So if 10 extra calories help me stay consistent and feeling good, then yeah, I’ll take that deal. This isn’t about perfection. It’s about progress, and I’m getting exactly the results that most people start fasting for in the first place.\n\nFor **magnesium**, I take magnesium glycinate capsules (200 mg per pill) in the correct daily amount. And I also mix in **creatine monohydrate** (5 grams) into my solution. Creatine isn’t essential to a fast, but it’s great for brain health, cellular hydration, and it’s safe. I sip this all of this in one solution throughout the day instead of downing it all at once. That helps keep my stomach settled and my electrolytes steady.\n\nIf you’re planning something like this, just be smart about it. Do your research. Don’t neglect your electrolytes. And don’t torture yourself unnecessarily if a small flavor boost helps you stay consistent. It’s your fast. The goal is to improve your health, not earn a merit badge from some imaginary fasting police.\n\nHappy to answer any questions anyone has. I’ll keep the updates coming.\n\nP.S. I’m thinking about shooting for 41 days, a solid 1,000 hours. If I make it that far, I’ll post progress pics.",

I have done a 22 day fast before, and I did it with those nasty trace mineral drops you can get on Amazon. They made me want to quit my fast stat! The electrolytes were so concentrated that they made me want to throw up. Since then, I discovered LMNT. I know there's a lot of controversy about these, but as you say, if it's the tool that keeps you going, then do it. I'm currently on fasting day 8 and LMNT will definitely be part of my routine. You can do this!!! Great job!",

I read through all of the community info, so I don't think my questions are off limits, but please help me understand if I ask questions incorrectly. My goals for fasting would be to have a reliable tool to help me lose about 20 pounds and then maintain it. I am very disciplined and eat very healthy (I lost 30 pounds since November through CICO). Also, it seems to genuinely feel good to be in a fasted state so I would like to experience those benefits. My questions are: I do HIIT every morning for about an hour (Orange Theory Fitness). Is it possible to do like two days of fasting, eat normal for a day, and then go back to fasting (on repeat) and still workout this much? Is black coffee advisable or does it seem to trigger hinger signals? Could I do protein supplements just to protect my muscles or would that disrupt the process? I am solid on the need for electrolytes and staying well hydrated. Any other newbie info?",

    "body": "Yes, I created this subreddit. But I think I may have created a problem!\n\nNot to act like a full-on main character, but maybe 1 or 2 of you have noticed that I have stopped posting on this sub. I also deleted my TikTok which was mainly based around UPF, and I really stopped engaging in a lot of the discourse around it. This was mainly due to some health stuff I had going on, and a growing realisation that I didn’t love having my face exposed to that manly people. \n\nMainly, though - I just didn’t see the point. I have grown tired of the frustration that arises in me as I debate over food companies, conglomerates, and what they have done to our food system. What felt like a revelation to me, something that fundamentally altered how I understand my relationship to food, my former obesity, my relationship with exercise, movement, and (yes really) perhaps even with the natural world, my place in it, and other existential thought processes - that revelation was just batted away by food companies, and ‘scientists’ funded by food companies, with the exact same group of excuses that stopped the tobacco industry from being regulated for so long. [This video really helped me understand that on a deeper level, if you’re interested](https://youtu.be/vAgn5R3EUnU?si=w0FxdhBI-LC6cqb9). We’re decades off regulation and proper labelling and education around this stuff, it’s brutal to understand that thousands will die and live with overweight and obesity, as well as metabolic health problems, even just in my country. \n\nAnd it’s not just the companies and the food industry, it’s people around me too. _Yes dear, we can see you’re much healthier and happier, thinner and fitter, and a nicer person to be around. But we like our Doritos and our white bread and we feel a bit threatened by all this, so we’re going to go ahead and label you as having an eating disorder._ An ED fuelled by pseudoscience. Oh, and by the way statistically you’ll gain the weight back in 2-5 years. Also, you have an exercise addiction, because you won’t get drunk on a Friday night since you have parkrun in the morning. \n\nOk, so anger and a demand for change isn’t going to do wonders for my mental health. But I can try to help in my own way. Right, let me log onto Reddit and have a chat about the daily realities of living this way. Fuck ‘em, I am happier and healthier and I have done that for myself and my future children and our family life together, not for external approval. Let’s see how my supportive Reddit community is getting on. \n\n_‘Is this UPF??!’ (an ingredient list absolutely chock full of additives and printed on plastic)_\n\nHm, what else? \n\n_‘Is this UPF?!’ (A tin of beans with a little citric acid)_\n\nOk…\n\n_‘I am trying to reduce UPF but I really love pop tarts. Anyone have any recommendations for UPF-free pop tarts?_\n\nYikes.\n\n_‘UPF free cocoa pops?!’_\n\n\n_‘I have been eating 800 calories of dried fruit and yoghurt bites a day. Why am I not losing weight?’_\n\n\n_‘If you eat seed oils it’s basically poison and you may as well eat emulsifiers neat from the bottle’_\n\n\n_‘I have a history of severe anorexia. Do you think I should allow myself to eat a little soya lecithin while in recovery?’_ (By the way, if it isn’t clear, you probably shouldn’t be here if you have a restrictive ED. Please prioritise food freedom and don’t allow UPF to become a reason to stall recovery)\n\n\n_‘I have my cousin’s wedding next week and they’ll be serving bread, and I don’t know whether or not it’s UPF. Should I contact the caterers?’_\n\n\n_‘Do vegan mock meats count as UPF?’_\n\nLook, I know it’s all well-meaning, and some of these (exaggerated) examples are good questions, in a way. But I can’t help but feel that so much of it misses the point. Living a low-UPF lifestyle - or as I have begun to call it, a real-food eating pattern - isn’t about nitpicking. It’s not about dissecting through ingredients lists. It’s not a diet, it’s not a food restriction, it’s not a list of things you can and can’t eat. It’s an eating pattern. And dietary patterns are what predict health outcomes, not individuals dietary choices. It’s about what you do, most of the time. What you prioritise, what you value in your dietary pattern, and your mindset around food. Sometimes I have a bar of Dairy Milk Wholenut, and that doesn’t change my eating _pattern_. I prioritise whole foods and plants, but that’ll probably always be something I take joy in after a half-marathon or just because.\n\nI can find no better way of describing it than by saying that real-food eating is essentially about, well, **vibes**. \n\nI don’t check the salad in my local cafe for UPF croutons. I don’t worry about whether they’re using sunflower oil in my local vegan salad place. I don’t worry about bread at a wedding, a pain au chocolat after a long run with friends, a little ginger flavouring in my kombucha when I’m on the move. I don’t restrict myself in that way. But equally I don’t pretend that salt and vinegar crisps aren’t UPF. Or magic ‘UPF-free’ loophole products (with perhaps the exception of fruit leather snacks…!). Yes, your cereal is UPF. And so is your ice cream, your packaged biscuits and your flavoured coffee syrup.\n\n**There are no loopholes.** That’s the point. You can’t reformulate products away from being ultra-processed. At a certain point, they’re products. They exist to make money and to make you buy more. They’re wrapped in plastic, they’re shipped worldwide, and they’ve been formulated a certain way. They’re UPF, whatever the ingredients are. \n\n‘But technically….!!!’ No! You’re missing the point. Eating real food means just that: I eat fresh, whole, proper food. I know what that means. You know what that means. I can describe it and you can imagine some cornucopia of real food displayed on some Italian riviera somewhere, and you know what’s there and what’s not. Yes there are canned products, and preserved products. Fresh or dried fruit, vegetables aplenty, quality meats, fish, cheese. Beans, pulses, dairy products, yogurt, kefir and fresh jams and preserves. Fresh eggs, water, tea and coffee. Pasta, pulses, Condiments, relishes, chutneys, ground spices. Cordials in the summer when I can get them fresh, with sparkling water and lemon if I like it. Proper bread, crackers and nuts and seeds. Biscotti perhaps, or maybe some fresh tiramisu. A little chocolate of an evening, sometimes fresh gelato on a sunny day. Warming soups in the winter, and cold noodle salads in the summer with ginger and garlic. I drink a lot of water, I eat as many plants as I can get in, and I don’t really think about it. \n\nThe point is, I know what a whole food looks like and so does almost everyone. **The beauty of the UPF concept is precisely that it’s not another strict definition that companies can ‘technically’ formulate their products around. ** ‘Real food’ and ‘products’ rarely go hand in hand. That’s why the companies are running scared, and it’s why they’re trying to discredit the entire concept. And questions like a lot of the things I see on this sub aren’t helping - they’re just proving the food industry’s point about UPF not being ‘clear enough’, even though really we all know what it means.\n\nThere’s a lot of great stuff on this sub - I particularly love seeing people’s meal ideas and hearing about how living this way has changed people’s lives. And I recognise that there needs to be a degree of ‘Is this UPF’ talk. But stop trying to get out of living this way on a technicality. Embrace it. Eat whole foods, feel good. Snack on fruit and veg, cheese and nuts. And relax a little - it should be a joy. And it is a joy, when you allow it to be. I rarely think about what I don’t eat because what I do eat is such a joy to me now. I never count calories, I never worry about fat content or fear the density of my food. I eat well, I eat whole food with joy and pleasure. \n",

If we can keep things more additive than subtractive (eg: \"try this recipe\" instead of \"don't eat X\") we can maintain a positive vibe to the community and (I hope) discourage the purity culture/orthorexia that can spring up around topics like this.",

I believe that this is what leads to the constant 'is this UPF posts'. Especially given diet culture has promoted these fads for decades, it has become normal to seek the 'gluten free', 'fat free' or 'high protein' option instead of changing the way we think about food. It is more natural for some to look for the UPF free option and restrict it rather than ADDING whole unprocessed food.\n\n Personally I have found the UPF thing to relieve me of a lot of guilt around my perceived lack of self control over food. I've always been one of those people who buys a packet of biscuits and almost compulsively finishes the whole packet within a day or two and then proceeds to feel bad about myself for it. Same thing goes for bread, I could easily demolish 6 slices of toasted sandwich bread with butter spread and a cuppa. Now, since changing my food 'pattern' and eating my own homemade sourdough, I struggle to eat 2 slices without being stuffed!",

Look at the crazy monstrosities paleo people make I've honestly seen 'healthy paleo cheesecake' because it was groud cashews and honey vs cream cheese and everyone coos about how healthy it is then wonders why they aren't losing weight because they are only eating 'approved' food.\n\nI've seen this behaviouir with every restrictive diet under the sun. initial weight loss because of the restrictive nature of the diet then almost sabotage like behaviour around eating things that are 'well technically it's XYZ' which i feel any child could point out the emperor has no clothes on.\n\nI think we need people to consider UPF to be a systematic problem more than an individual problem and that a lot of UPF just shouldn't be considered food. Personally I just shifted the mental classifications of things in my mind, even if it happened before I learned of UPF conceptually it's sound. What I mean is sweet ceral became a candy in my mind, alright very rarely in small amounts. Fast food which I already limited wasn't 'hey it's just calories, it's just a hamburger, people have been eaitng meat and bread for ages' it became a rare treat food because 'this isn't really food but sure'. \n\nFinally I think the definition to those of us that have had more than a passing interest in nutrition is obvious, but it's easy to neglect years of information accumulated around nutrition. by the time i picked up Ultraprocessed people I was already avoiding seed oils, sugars and the 'empty calories' of low nutrient UPF.

How I see it is that UPF is the consumerist version of food, the stuff that's formulated, packaged, branded and advertised to make you want it, just so that those companies selling it can make more money. They can't make huge extra profit selling carrots or beef that's slightly different to the next farm over, so they had to change food into a product where you can make more profit from it by targeting us via all the worst advertising tricks in the book. Like you say, eat natural food (or \"food\") as much as you can, but be aware of what all the branded products are, buy them on occasion if you like, but understand they're products, not food. The West has very much fallen for consumerism and these \"industrially created edible substances\" only exist to make profit for someone else. That's their sole purpose and reason for existence. But don't beat yourselves up over all the details, just eat as much real food as you can and reduce anything in packaging with funky brand names to an occasional treat.",

We (society) are so distanced from real food, asserting that it's normal to eat out every day and eat highly processed foods all day.  No. That's not normal,it's not healthy.  We are too addicted to convenience and have 1000 excuses to avoid being responsible for what we eat.\n\nFurthermore I've been given shit on this sub because \"whole foods\" is just a grocery chain in the US and the writers I cite are \"too old\" - smart people have been writing about our problematic food systems for decades, journalists and scientists with nothing to sell, and you all are slavishly devoted to one popular book/app/site.    Use that as a springboard to explore other books, other writers, other ideas.  Don't get hung up on the language that's trending today, and really investigate these issues.\n\nAnd everyone needs to read and understand the food labelling laws in your jurisdiction.  They are problematic, but you need to know how to read and interpret them, if you care at all about what you're eating.\n\n  Try to avoid binary thinking.  All or nothing, with us or against us, us/them thinking does not help solve problems.  Learn and adapt, do what's right for you.   And don't let perfect become an enemy of the food.

Other people have to come to these realizations on their own. This is how people truly change. Telling someone what they should do doesn't really work. You have to lead from example and show the benefits and hopefully genesis occurs in other people.

If people disagree share information regarding it.  People aren't missing the point it's just people have not reached the level you are at.  Everyone has to start somewhere and it may just be trying to understand what UPF is.  Or switching out their pop tarts for toast with jam.

I assume the combination of the citric acid, lemon oil and sugar is what's giving me tart lemon flavor. Other ingredients include onion, sugar, garlic, celery seed. \n\nI know citric acid is just vitamin c and I don't have any philosophical objections to knowing it's not just Powdered Essence of Lemon, but what's annoying to me is that I can't manage to recreate the flavor profile without a shaker.

I was constantly scratching my skin and physically exfoliating because it makes you itch like crazy. Once I started recovery I got really into skincare but finding the right products for my skin was so hard. I have super sensitive combination skin. I reacted badly to almost every product | tried, either directly after applying or it would make me break out after 1-2 days. I wasted so much money on skincare items but at least it wasn't for nothing because I finally have a routine that my skin loves! :)\n\nStep one: Avene xeracalm oil cleanser\n\nStep two: Isana ultra sensitive calming serum\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Pentylene Glycol, Glycerin, Polyglycery -6 Stearate, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Coco-Caprylate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Hydrogenated Vegetable Glycerides, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Oenothera Biennis Oil, Panthenol, Ethylhexy|glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Citric Acid, Pantolactone\n\nRight now it's still hot where I live so it's hydrating enough but when it gets colder I use vaseline at night to look in the moisture.\n\nI also use tea tree oil as spot treatment for pimpler & Salicylic acid to exfoliate when I can tell mys v needs it (less than once a week, even that was tu-much for my sensitive skin, it caused break outs)\n\nI do also use sunscreen but I haven't found the right one yet.

When the white part (tha albumin) is more basic, it won't adhere to the shell as readily as when the albumin is more acidic (low pH). This is why baking soda (basic/alkaline) in the water would help with the albumin inside of the eggs not adhering to the shell. I couldn't find any information on lemon slices, but it seems like it might actually have the opposite from desired effect.",

    "body": "1. Safely Unclog A Drain\nA great natural solution for unclogging the drain! Just drop four Alka-Seltzer tablets down the drain, followed by a cup of white vinegar and allow to stand for about ten minutes. Flush with a pot of boiling water. Doing this on a regular basis can help keep that drain clear. This also works to deodorize the drain.\n\n2. Clean a Toilet In A Hurry\nDrop two tablets in the toilet, wait 20 minutes for the citric acid to loosen the grime, scrub and flush. The bowl will be clean, shiny, and deodorized. Handy for a quick clean in case of uninvited, unannounced, surprise guests.\n\n3. An All-Purpose Cleaner\nAlka Seltzer can also be a good all around cleaner. Plop three tablets into 8 ounces of warm water. Once the fizzing stops, dip a sponge in the water (or you could fill a spray bottle) and wipe down counters, tiles and tubs. You can even place some in your sink and use as mop water. Just add five tablets to one half gallon of water.\n\n4. Soothe Insect Bites\nDrop two tablets in warm water, then soak a cotton ball in the solution. Place on the bite for 30 minutes for relief from the insect bites.\n\n5. Catch a Fish\nFish love bubbles. Break a tablet in half and throw it out near your fishing line, or put a tablet inside your tube jig and cast off. The fish won’t be able to resist the stream of bubbles.\n\n6. Remove Burnt On Food From Bakeware\nDrop 5 tablets into a sink full of hot water and let your cookware soak for an hour or so. The burnt food will come off with ease.\n\n7. Whiten and Brighten Your Laundry\nTo get rid of dingy yellow color on white cotton, soak your whites in a solution of a gallon of warm water and two Alka Seltzer tablets. Then hang your whites in the sun to dry to get rid of any lingering stains.\n\n8. Deodorize the Fridge\nFor a clean, fresh smelling refrigerator, drop an Alka-Seltzer tablet in a cup of water and leave it in the refrigerator for a half hour. If there is still a smell in the refrigerator, then wash down the inside of the refrigerator with another Alka-Seltzer tablet in water.\n\n9. Clean a Glass Jar, Flower Vase or Thermos\nFor those difficult to clean vessels with narrow-necks, and hard to reach places, drop two Alka-Seltzer tablets in, add hot water and swish it around until the tablets are dissolved and let it sit for an hour. Rinse, and the glass jar, vase or Thermos will be as clean as new.\n\n10. Restore Stained Plastic Containers\nGot spaghetti sauce stains on your plastic containers? Simply fill your container with warm to hot water and depending on the size drop 1-2 tablets into the water. Let sit for 30 minutes and the stains will disappear before your eyes.\n\n11. Polish Your Jewelry\nDrop two tablets in a bowl of warm water. Let your jewelry soak for about 20 minutes. It will look new again! (Note: This is not safe for pearls or opals.)\n\n12. Build Rockets For Kids\nEntertain little ones by heading outside with an empty film canister, filled halfway with warm water. Drop in half a tablet, snap on the lid and place the canister upside down on the sidewalk or driveway. Take a step back and watch your rocket blast off!\n\n13. Clean Your Coffeemaker\nFill the water chamber of the coffeemaker and then drop in three tablets. When the Alka-Seltzer has dissolved, put the coffeemaker through a brew cycle. This will clean out all the internal components. Run through another plain water cycle before using the machine again for coffee.\n\n14. Help For Nicotine Addiction\nIf you’re trying to quit smoking Alka-Seltzer can help. Take two tablets three times a day to relieve nicotine withdrawal symptoms and curb cravings.\n\n15. Cure Urinary Tract Infections\nShowing signs of a urinary infection? Take two tablets in a glass of water as soon as you notice symptoms. Results are almost immediate. Keep in mind that Aspirin is a main ingredient in Alka-Seltzer so those with Aspirin allergies shouldn’t use it.\n\n16. Clean and Deodorize A Cooler\nAfter an outing or trip, add about 1 inch of water to the bottom of your cooler, drop 4 tablets in, and let sit for an hour. After an hour, rinse and dry. All smells will be gone and it will be clean and ready for its next use.\n\n17. Clean Dentures\nDrop an Alka-Seltzer tablet into a glass of warm water, and then drop your dentures into the glass for about ten minutes. The citric acid and carbonation will remove the toughest stains from your dentures and other prosthetic dental work. This is an excellent substitute for more expensive denture cleanser products.",

Some of them don't seem to require any product at all.  If you soak a pan in hot water without Alka-Selzer, it's probably going to be just as easy to clean.  If your refigerator stinks, clean it?
