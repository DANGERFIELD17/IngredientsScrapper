I’m not affiliated with any brand but I can see how some may feel negatively towards this, especially considering some of the history on the sub for brands to exploit the readers here. \n\nI may make a separate post later with recommendations as well as a bit of a discussion around it for people who are looking for recommendations. \n\n—-\n\nHi guys!\n\nYears ago I wrote[ the sidebar'd piece about dehydrated skin that I still get tagged in today](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/22c4tf/dehydrated_skin_and_the_moisture_barrier_an/). I wanted to update that with some more detailed information and knowledge on why it happens, what is happening, et cetra. Hopefully this can replace that guide, since I feel like it was a bit too broad. :)\n\n---\n\nDehydration is characterized by a lack of hydration in the cellular system and intercellular channels of the skin. It is not a skin type, but a skin condition. It does not discriminate between dry, oily, or combination skin types, and is frequently aggravated by lifestyle and skincare choices. \n\nTo understand skin dehydration, you need to first understand the role of the natural moisturizing factors (NMF) in skin hydration. The NMF is an invisible lipid composition that sits on the top layer of the stratum corneum (SC) as well as interwoven in the top most layers of corneocytes (skin cells), making up a part in what is considered the \"acid mantle\" of the skin. The term NMF first appeared in 1959, but was not universally adopted immediately. It is hydrosoluable (able to dissolve in water) and hygroscopic (able to retain water), composed of about 40% free amino acids, 12% pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (PCA), 12% lactates, 8.5% sugars/peptides/inorganic acids, 7% urea, 6% chloride, 5% sodium, and various small amounts of other materials. \n\nIt serves three major functions:\n\n1.  Protecting skin from damage\n2.  Encouraging desquamation (exfoliation of the upper most layer of corneocytes)\n3.  Controlling permeability of the SC\n\nThe NMFs are very effective natural humectants, drawing moisture to the skin from the atmosphere, even at humidity as low as 50%. \"Hydrated NMF forms ionic interacts with keratin fibers, reducing the intermolecular forces between the fibers and thus increasing the elasticity of the stratum corneum.\"² This keeps the skin healthy and supple in appearance. It also serves to prevent excessive water influx (see the third major function above), such as when your skin wrinkles from being in the bath or shower for too long, which causes the corneocytes to shrink. \n\nWhile it is often thought that the stratum corneum is \"dead\" tissue, it still requires water to function effectively. The NMF serves to provide for this, drawing and holding much of the water required. For example, enzymes that cause skin cells to exfoliate away naturally, by breaking the various bonds holding corneocytes together, need water to do their job effectively. \n\nReduction or stripping away of the NMF results in dry skin ([known as xerosis](https://imgur.com/vBOb07w)), scaling, flaking, as well as fissuring and cracking ([such as severely cracked and dry heels](https://imgur.com/C0F7BKK)). It can also result in what we refer to as \"dehydrated skin\" (though this is not a medical term).\n\n* * *\n\nWhat Dehydration Feels Like\n===========================\n\nDehydrated skin is one of the more difficult conditions to diagnose because it is frequently invisible. There are many \"tips\" online about how to diagnose dehydrated skin, such as pinching the back of your hand to see how quickly the skin snaps back into place. *It's important to keep in mind that this only serves to show if your body is dehydrated. Dehydrated skin usually has less to do about the hydration inside of your body and more to do with how we treat the skin topically or the atmosphere around us.* This is why someone with dehydrated skin can pinch the back of their hand and see their skin immediately pop back into place, yet feel horrible irritation on their skin when applying a simple moisturizer.  \n\n[The skin usually looks dry, scaly, or flaky](https://imgur.com/cLTwbTf), and feels \"tight\" (such as after using a harsh cleanser). When pulled very gently, [it can appear to crinkle](https://imgur.com/8RRFIfj) (not to be confused with crepey skin, such as the skin appearance around joints), and can even look like it has a very thin layer of skin sitting atop the upper most layer of skin. In some people, it feels itchy. It is usually most evident on the forehead or nose. It can also look lackluster, dull, and lack \"bounce\" and suppleness. In some, it can take the form of crinkly but very shiny skin, usually due to abuse of skin remodelers like AHAs or BHAs. \n\nBoth dry and oily skin types can be dehydrated - dry skin because it struggles to hold onto moisture and oily because sufferers frequently use harsh cleansers or astringents to gain relief. According to Milady's Skin Care and Cosmetic Ingredients Dictionary, \"When oily skin becomes dehydrated, the surface layers of cells harden ... and block oil secretion. The result is an entrapment of the oils under the stratum corneum layer. This is particularly detrimental in the case of someone with acne because it also results in the entrapment of the infection.\"¹ \n\nDehydrated skin also typically responds more viciously to active ingredients, such as BHAs, AHAs, sulfur, retinoids, and vitamin C. It can also respond to completely benign ingredients, creating a burning sensation or the skin feeling flushed and hot.\n\n* * *\n\nCauses of Dehydration\n=====================\n\nThe most common culprits of dehydration of the skin is stripping cleansers, harsh soaps, and hot water, though a host of other causes can come into play for some people, including skin conditions that aggravate dry skin (again, while dehydrated skin is not the same as dry skin, dry skin is especially prone to dehydration) or create acne (which frequently causes people to \"overtreat\" the acne and strip their skin).\n\nSkin Conditions\n---------------\n\n*   Atopic dermatitis\n*   Irritant contact dermatitis\n*   Psoriasis\n*   Cutaneous lymphoma\n\nEnvironmental\n-------------\n\n*   Seasonal changes\n*   Dry air (low humidity)\n*   Flowing air (especially wind)\n*   UV radiation (tanning beds, the sun)\n*   Overwashing\n*   Age\n*   Sunburn\n*   Cigarette smoking and smoke exposure\n*   Friction (including harsh scrubbing and mechanical exfoliation tools like the Clarisonic)\n\nHeredity Disorders\n------------------\n\n*   Ichthyosis vulgaris\n*   Netherton syndrome\n\nHormonal\n--------\n\n*   Hypothyroidism\n*   Estrogen deficiency\n\nTopical\n-------\n\n*   Alcohol/isopropyl alcohol/SD alcohol/denatured alcohol\n*   Drinking alcohol\n*   Essential oils\n*   Clay masks\n*   Sodium lauryl sulfate\n*   Bar soap\n*   Astringents (particularly alcohol-based astringents)\n*   Topical medications (e.g. retinoids)\n*   Excessive AHA or BHA use\n\n* * *\n\nCaring for Dehydrated Skin\n==========================\n\nThe most important thing when solving dehydrated skin is consideration of the products you use as well as your environment. This means paying special attention to the ingredients label when shopping, being cautious about what is applied to the skin, and what your home environment is like (and potentially limiting outside exposure to harsh wind and sun). \n\nSince everything starts with your cleanser, this means picking a creamier cleanser or one with lower amounts of surfactants. I've done a whole post on cleansers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), if you'd like to read about all the various types of cleansers and how they work. The long and short of it is look for either a wipe-off cleansers, such as Albolene; an oil cleanser that emulsifies (rinses clean) in water, such as my beloved Clinique Take the Day off Balm; a creamy cleanser, such as CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser or Aquanil; or a gentle sudsing cleanser, such as Paula's Choice Hydralight or CeraVe Foaming Cleanser. Avoid washing with hot water, which reduces the size of the micelles (the molecules created from surfactants, which cluster together), allowing them to penetrate deeper into the skin and strip it further. You'll also want to completely avoid bar soaps (pH is too high), micellar water (can be much more irritating), makeup wipes (same as micellar water), and harsh cleansers that make your skin feel tight after cleansing. \n\nA general rule of thumb is to look for mild surfactants, such as decyl glucoside, or multiple surfactants, like decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside, disodium cocoyl glutamate, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, cocoyl methyl glucamide, sodium cocoyl isethionate, and lauryl lactyl lactate. \n\nMoisturizers are also a cornerstone in treating dehydrated skin. Humectants are especially important. Some humectants to look for:\n\n*   **Glycerin** - A well-established humectant, it is a clear, thick liquid that is usually sticky on it's own. It is derived from combining water and fat, usually vegetable oil. It is not typically irritating, but it can be to some people in high concentrations.\n*   **Hyaluronic Acid (HA)** - A component of glycosaminoglycan, it occurs naturally in the dermis of the skin and is thought to play a very important role in skin function. It is advertised frequently as holding up to \"1000\" times it's weight in water (citation needed). When applied, \"hyaluronic acid forms a viscoelastic film in a manner similar to the way it holds water in the intercellular matrix of dermal connective tissue.\"¹ It needs application regularly to be effective, frequently breaking down in skin 24-48 hours after application (note: this is not the case with HA injections). It is best applied to damp skin, straight out of the shower.\n*   **Urea** - While it is frequently considered more of a moisturizer or keratolytic (able to break down bonds on dead skin) ingredient, urea has humectant properties and can attract and hold moisture in the SC.\n\n* * *\n\nHealing Dehydrated Skin\n=======================\n\nArmed with the proper ingredients, skin can typically bounce back within about two weeks (14 days). Once healed, skin should be maintained with ingredients and products that are beneficial to the skin's health. \n\nWhile healing dehydrated skin, it is recommended to use the most bland routine possible and avoid trying new things and any active ingredients at all. _It should go without saying that to heal dehydrated skin, you must drop the products that are creating the problem in the first place._ If you must change out one or two products that you believe were causing your dehydration, do so slowly and one at a time, starting with any cleansers and then moving on to moisturizers. \n\nPetrolatum is helpful to some people as well, but can cause problems for others. This is possibly due to it's ability to diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin in some people, which interferes with recovery. Your mileage may vary. \n\nIt is also recommended to sleep with a humidifier if you are in a particularly dry climate. You want to shoot for somewhere between 40-60% indoor humidity, as this will prevent the humectants from drawing moisture from the deeper layers of the skin, which evaporates away.\n\n* * *\n\nSources\n=======\n\n1.

It was a crucial part of my routine while dehydrated and I still use it to this day. I live in a very humid environment and have genetically oily skin, so I was struggling to find products for the daytime that hydrated enough but were also lightweight enough to not make my skin any more oily. Aloe was a life-saver - it was the extra hydrating layer that my skin was craving. It's not enough on it's own but when used in conjunction with a hyaluronic acid product and the proper moisturizer, it can do wonders. I just wanted to bring this up for any oily skin types (and others) that are struggling to find the right products.",

    "body": "About four years ago, I wrote the currently sidebar'd post, [\"Evaluating Your Current Routine\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1x1ubd/evaluating_your_current_routine_read_me_before/). In that, I recommended things to ask yourself and consider before buying new products or changing your routine entirely.\n\nI recently began blogging, but I wanted to bring these posts to Reddit as well for people who did not want to click out of the sub. \n\nLots of this is content that has been referenced over the years on this subreddit, as well as elsewhere. However, I understand the frustration for new users stumbling in, seeing product recommendations and terminology being thrown around, as well as an enormous sidebar. It's pretty anxiety-inducing. I also see a lot of people skipping from products to products, asking what to try next. \n\nMy goals with this series is to break down *what* goes into your cleansers and how it affects your skin so you are empowered to make better choices as well as understand some of the science that gets passed around.\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down your average, general cleansers as well as oil cleansers (or the oil-cleansing method aka OCM) and micellar cleansers. Let's dive right in!\n\n---\n\n**Introduction to Cleansers**\n\nCleansers work by dissolving or binding to things on the skin that aren't normally rinsed away by water, such as the waxes or oils produced by our skin.\n\nWithout getting too into the weeds, they are able to do this with surfactants  (or \"the thing that makes cleansers sudsy\"). The most common surfactants, and the ones you may have heard of are SLS and SLES (sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate). These ingredients work by binding to the lipids (oils such as jojoba oil or silicones like dimethicone) and then being whisked away by their water-loving properties. Once mixed with water, surfactant molecules cluster together into little spheres known as micelles. Some surfactants molecular size allows them to penetrate deeper into the skin (namely SLS), where they can bind to skin cells. As you can imagine, this is very irritating to skin, and is what causes the eventual drying that you may experience after using some products.\n\nSo by increasing the size of these molecules or adding additional ingredients, we get a gentler cleanser.\n\nIf you've hung out in any beauty circle, you've probably also heard chatter of pH - \"What is the pH of that cleanser? Have you tried the CosRx Low pH Cleanser?\". The pH value of a cleanser can have an impact on how harsh your cleanser is on your skin as well, and simply put, it's because the surface of your skin is naturally pretty acidic.\n\nGoing back to Chemistry class really quickly, you'll probably remember something called the \"pH Scale.\"\n\nThings on the left side of the scale (1-6) are considered acidic. Things on the right side (8-14) are considered basic or alkaline. And of course, there is what is considered neutral, or pH 7. Skin has a pH of around 5.5, but becomes more basic the further down into the dermis you go, reaching a pH of about 7. Why is this important, you may be asking? Well, if you think back to your high school Chemistry course, you may have remembered the good ol' baking soda and vinegar reaction. When this reaction -- called an acid-base reaction -- occurs, the baking soda and vinegar exchange atoms and form different compounds, namely water and carbon dioxide. This is because bases are compounds that generally want to donate atoms and acids are compounds that generally want to accept atoms.\n\nAs skin comes in contact with other ingredients, even water, the pH temporarily raises and other compounds are created. Fatty acids (read: acidic components) of the skin are removed.\n\nHealthy skin can usually re-balance itself within an hour or so. Some skin takes longer to do this, especially skin that is prone to irritation, such as skin with acne, rosacea, eczema, or psoriasis. This is why your boyfriend can cleanse his face with a Dial soap bar and have glowing skin an hour later, while you're busily slathering on layer after layer of moisturizer.\n\nUsing a cleanser that is closer to our skin's natural pH is the obvious solution to this problem, and most modern cleansers are formulated much better than those of the past.\n\nSo now you're probably asking yourself: *Well, how can I test the pH of the cleanser I would like to buy? And how do I know the surfactant isn't going to irritate my skin?*\n\nA general rule of thumb is to look for mild surfactants, such as decyl glucoside, or multiple surfactants, like decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside, disodium cocoyl glutamate, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, cocoyl methyl glucamide, sodium cocoyl isethionate, and lauryl lactyl lactate.\n\nYou should also look for moisturizers, like oils, ceramides, cholesterol, and humectants (water-binding ingredients such as glycerin, hyaluronic acid, or squalane). Avoid saponified oils (please don't use Dr. Bronner's on your skin) and bar soap.\n\nNow I know you're asking: What about oil cleansers then?\n\n---\n\n**Oil Cleansers**\n\nWhat if I told you that your grandmother was ahead of the game?\n\nNearly all of us have seen a tub of Pond's Cold Cream hanging out in our grandmother's bathroom or on her vanity. You might've seen her dab some all over her skin and wipe away all of her makeup with a tissue. She may have sworn by it as the thing that kept her looking young, and she's not entirely wrong.\n\nI like to think of oil cleansers as being broken down into two types of cleansers -- wipe-off cleansers like your grandmother's Pond's, and emulsifying cleansers like the translucent oil cleansers that come in a pump or tub.\n\nThe former -- wipe-off cleansers -- are the most common mixtures in the cosmetics industry. They are usually simple mixtures of oil and water, and are high in water content, which makes them inexpensive.\n\nThey spread easily and often leave an oily or richly moisturized feeling behind. They're typically purchased by people with mature skin, but are a great alternative for people with dry skin.\n\nThe latter -- emulsifying cleansers -- are also mixtures of oil and water, but are higher in oil content, which makes them more expensive. They contain emulsifiers that bind well to water, which allows them to rinse away in water.\n\nThe benefit of these cleansers is there is no real \"sudsing\" action on the skin. Indeed many of them can actually feel \"moisturizing\" due to their ingredient makeup. They are also excellent for breaking down make-up and other waterproof things, such as mascara, due to the high oil content.\n\nWhen picking out an oil-cleanser, look for shortened ingredient lists. Don't be swayed by extracts or other frills that will wash away. The oil itself will be the biggest point of irritation (or not) for your skin, so don't be afraid of \"boring\" oils like mineral oil or petrolatum, which is one of the blandest, most non-reactive molecules around.\n\nJust one more to go...\n\n---\n\n**Micellar Cleansers**\n\nMicellar water is quite literally made up of micelles, or the molecular bunches of surfactants that group up, their water-loving butts faced outwards. These larger bunches of molecules, diluted in combinations of water and hydrating ingredients (such as glycerin), are the most mild of cleansers.\n\nThe percentage of surfactant to other ingredients is generally so low that micellar water does not need to be washed away. This allows the hydrating ingredients, such as glycerin, to stay on the skin after the debris has been removed.\n\nThis makes micellar water ideal for sensitive skin or prepping the skin for product application, when cleansing with a standard cleanser and water will be too drying.\n\n---\n\n**All Wrapped Up**\n\nSo what does this all mean? Here are some general skin cleanser guidelines to follow:\n\n* **Cleanse your skin at least once a day.** At the end of the day, your skin not only has a build-up of oils, but also debris and particulates in the air.\n* **Don't pile it on.** Your non-sudsing cleanser does not need to suds to work.\n* **Two-step cleanse for removing make-up.** Most make-up is waterproof and does not easily cleanse away. Use an oil cleanser to break down the make-up and remove it.\n* **Use cottons to remove cream cleansers like Pond's.** The friction will help to remove grime and dirt. Splash with water after to remove any leftover emulsifiers.\n* **Use cool water when cleansing.** Hot water can make surfactants penetrate deeper by reducing the size of the micelles, which is why your hot shower is more irritating and drying to your skin than the less-fun cooler shower.\n* **Moisturize.** Even water strips away the valuable fatty acids in your skin. Using a moisturizer on your skin after will help your skin to re-balance itself quicker.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n\n* [Kind of Stephen](https://kindofstephen.com/)\n* [DermaScope](https://www.dermascope.com/ingredients/surfactants-and-emulsifiers)\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n",

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea?

His trigger seems to be getting dirt/debris/sweat on is skin, so it’s been a challenge to say the least. We had a particular challenging weekend of yard work where he was outside for maybe 15 minutes with minimal sweat and he still had a flare up after he thoroughly cleaned his face. \n\nI’m going to pass this information along to him and read it myself so I can get a better understanding of what we can try. I appreciate you taking the time to thoroughly research different treatment options!",

        "body": "My Mom had subtype 3, with thickened skin. She had it really badly her whole life. I have some rosacea but have done my best to try to not wind up like her.  Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

When done in-office, treatments are spaced a few weeks to a month apart.\n\n* Done improperly you can end up with hypopigmentation (white or colorless spots in the skin that do not return to a normal color)\n\n* It hurts.\n\n* You can not fully sterilize the needles at home. They can be sanitized at best.\n\n* The needles can become bent over time, or come from the manufacturer already bent. Small bends can be imperceptible to the naked eye and can cause unwanted damage to your skin.\n\n**Because of these risks, ScA does not recommend attempting dermarolling or dermastamping at home.

    "body": "I’m about to drop a lot of information here, but please read! I learned a lot about how to properly use sulfates and silicones, so I want to share!! \n\nSo here’s what I’ve learned from Sarah Tran, who has thigh length hair. \n\nEdit: People have brought up genetics. Of course genetics is a huge factor in hair length, but the point of this post is to maintain *healthy* hair, so that it will grow with minimal breakage and split ends. I bring up her length because it is *healthy* as well as long. \n\nAlso note: silicones and sulfates won’t directly contribute to hair growth, but will make your hair stronger and less likely to break and fall out, indirectly resulting in longer fuller hair\n\nFirst off, silicones and sulfates are NOT bad. In fact, if she didn’t use silicones, she couldn’t protect her hair and have such long hair without split ends. The way most people USE silicones is bad though. \n\nThink about it like this: If you have a pair of high heels that are comfortable and you love them, but your friend asks you to go jogging, the shoes are not the problem, the *use* is.\n\nSilicones do the following: \n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair which makes it easier to detangle \n\n-Provides UV protection\n\n-Seals in moisture to prevent dryness\n\n-Makes hair look shiny\n\n-Reduces frizz and adds definition to curls\n\n-Softens and smooths cuticle\n\nSilicones do all these amazing things!!!! However, there are 4 types: airy, friendly (easy to wash out), resilient, and NO GO silicones\n\n*\n#Airy silicones: \nThese evaporate out of the hair after 10 minutes to a few hours. These do not have any negative effect on hair:\n\n-Cyclomethicone \n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n*\n#Friendly silicones:\nThese wash out of the hair with sulfate free shampoos:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate) \n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n*\n#Resilient Silicones:\nThese do NOT build up on the strand, but are non soluble and *require a sulfate* to remove:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone -Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n*\n#NO GO Silicones:\nThese require multiple washes with sulfate shampoo to remove. NEVER USE THESE!:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone \n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone \n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18 \n\n-Cetyl Phosphate \n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiylamodimethicone \n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n*\n#Mild Sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nThese are Best used to remove airy and friendly silicones and in your regular, daily mild shampoo. These do NOT remove resilient silicones. \n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n*\n#High Strength HARSH sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nTreat these exactly like harsh sulfates and avoid them when looking for a regular, daily mild sulfate-free shampoo. BEST USED FOR REMOVING RESILIENT SILICONES:\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate \n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n*\n#SULFATES that remove silicones:\nThese strong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Mild sulfates May require more applications to remove resilient silicones:\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n*\n#Also here is a list of cationic (anti-static) ingredients:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n*\n#So basically:\n\n1. Get a good sulfate free shampoo\n\n2. Get a good shampoo that HAS sulfates\n\n3. Use airy and friendly silicones ALL the time\n\n4. Use resilient silicones once or twice a month. This will protect your hair more than friendly silicones. Resilient silicones must be washed out with a SULFATE shampoo at the max FIVE DAYS AFTER APPLICATION\n\n*\n#And one last thing!!!

        "body": "Hi! Guys please do your research and don't trust everything you hear. Having thigh length hair is a great achievement but it doesn't make someone a science expert, so posting this on a science sub is so misleading. \n\nI'm seeing some red flags. First off, no scientific sources. Second, commonly demonized ingredients in the push for \"clean\" beauty are again demonized here without proper given cause. And third, there are a few things that stuck out to me as glaringly false from what research I've done. Lastly, fourth, the phrasing at all of \"no go silicones\" and just the incorrect categorization of silicones that assigns them value (better to look at the truer category names: volatile, amine-modified, etc.)\n\nMost ingredients on that \"blacklist\" have little or absolutely no evidence of being bad. \n\nAnd the thing that strikes me as absolutely false is the list of cationic surfactabts as static causing, when most research and literature says the exact opposite - that they're anti static ingredients. Give me a minute and I'll add a few sources for the anti-static claim for cationic surfactants.\n\n> The widely used cationic surfactant docosyltrimethylammonium chloride was overall well performing, especially when it came to reduction of friction force and reduction of flyaway hair during combing. It was superior to the other cationic surfactant tested regarding reduction of frizz. This study suggests that the silicones and protein derivatives showed less promising results regarding the overall manageability. Preliminary data has implications that the efficiency of anti-frizz is correlated with cationic charge and high hydrophobicity of the conditioning agent. \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DYduaceeTnvMJ \n\n> Behentrimonium chloride and Cetrimonium chloride are known to be very effective hair conditioners with detangling, anti-frizz, and anti-static  \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3D0FbAuscGO8AJ",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

        "body": "Hi AB! :) I lurk here *every single night* and also occasionally post here. I recently wrote this... enormous monstrosity on rosacea and shared it over at /r/skincareaddiction, but also wanted to share it here since I have found lots of value in the discussions here as well as the science surrounding AB ingredients (such as snail mucin, propolis, etc.). \n\nIn the future, I plan to do a large post that combines both AB product recommendations and SCA recommendations (as well as mine) for rosacea, but I felt this would be it's own post that I would later connect to this one.\n\nThanks so much for being awesome. I love this sub to bits and frequently come here when I am feeling down or anxious. I hope this helps some of you. <3",

My esthetics teachers have recommended cooling flared up rosacea skin (literally, whether with mist or a cold towel) and using soothing water based moisturizers and masks.  They say heavy occlusives can 'trap' the heat and irritation in the tissue if you apply it without cooling it down first.  Im interested if this is possible/viable, according to your research?

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

    "body": "Hey there! So I have extremely damaged hair that is breaking off every time I brush it (got a straight perm when my hair was bleached). In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I’ve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or “glucoside”.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or “methosulfate” (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application.

Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt’s best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the “feeling” of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this “protein overload” is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

sizes.\n\n##The above information about protein and sulfates was found on Science-y Hair Blog!\n\n#Ingredients for Scalp Health:\n\n##Aloe Vera Gel:\n\nAloe is a great natural scalp soother and also helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it’s wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

I had to test the products adequately before making my mind about them. Other than the products in the picture, I purchased the Milk Protein Shampoo Bar as well. Overall I am very angry at myself for trying these products out.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **0.5% FERULIC ACID, 15% VITAMIN C, 1% VITAMIN E MULTIVITAMIN AGE DEFENSE SERUM**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled Water, L-Ascorbic Acid Vitamin C, Alpha Tocopherol Vitamin E, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, D Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate)\n\n***My experience:***  This is the product I was the most excited about. Vitamin C is a powerhouse of an antioxidant and has many proven skin benefits. L-Ascorbic Acid is the most potent and studied form of Vitamin C, notorious for being highly unstable. I have used a bunch of Vitamin C serums but it can be really hard to find a well-formulated one, especially in India. I so wanted this to work out. Unfortunately, this serum broke my blemish-free skin-so-good spell (or Copper Peptide - will explain later). My skin was perfect right before the ER haul. After trying these products my skin started to break out left right and center. So after being frustrated with my new breakouts, I decided to check the PH of this serum. To my surprise, the PH came out to be PH 6-7. Vitamin C's work best between PH 2-3.5. I contacted the brand to know what they claim for the PH to be. They informed me the PH for the product is \"PH 2.5-3.2\" on their Instagram handle. I took it up further and after a lot of back and forth. [This](https://imgur.com/a/ihKkY6T) is the reply I received from the brand owner.  The preservatives & PH stabilizers that reacted were not mentioned in the ingredients list. I asked her later why they were not mentioned? I was told that the PH stabilizers and preservatives were less than 0.5% and anything less than 0.5% was not required to be mentioned. I, personally cannot understand that L-AA (15% and highly acidic PH 1-2) could turn a PH of 6-7 with just 0.01% of Ph stabilizers (As per what she claimed).\n\n***Texture:*** Thick goopy.

I haven't been able to get my hands on the TO/Niod ones. Let's copy-paste everything about my excitement and the sadness in what really happened with Vitamin C, here, as well. Basically, PH came out to be PH 2-3. The brand claimed it to be around PH 6-7. The owner admitted something went wrong. I discontinued usage. I received this product 2-3 days earlier to the Vitamin C serum. I broke out 2 days after introducing the Vitamin C & the Bakuchiol. I thought it was vitamin C that broke me out but in afterthought, it could be this serum as well. Maybe my skin barrier was ducked because of these, maybe it was an ingredient. Who knows? Interestingly this product mentions the preservatives. Not sure if it is because they are in a % above 0.05% or the brand just decided to put these in the ingredients list on the website.\n\n***Texture:*** Watery liquid, blue in color. Did not sting after application, slightly irritated my eyelids.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** All in all, the product was unstable and breaking me out (maybe). I will not be repurchasing unless I find out the changed and fixed the formula.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **SKIN SMOOTHENING SERUM - BAKUCHIOL EXTRACT**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Vitus vinifera \\[Grape seed oil\\], Psoralea corylifolia \\[Bakuchiol Extract7%\\], Vitamin E \\[Tocopheryl Acetate\\], Tanacetum annum \\[Tansy Essential Oil\\])\n\n***My experience:*** I had read a lot about Bakuchiol and wanted to give it a try. Bakuchiol can have anti-acne and anti-aging benefits very comparable to tretinoin as per primary studies. However, Bakuchiol is not the same as Babchi oil. A lot of brands claim to be using Babchi oil and that can actually have some side effects. This [article](https://bakuchiol.net/2019/10/14/babchi-oil-versus-bakuchiol/) explains the difference well. Thus I had contacted ER before purchasing to ensure they were using Bakuchiol and not Babchi extract. They claimed they were indeed using Bakuchiol. On the first experience, it had the typical essential oil smell. The fragrance is toooooo much and it lingers. As per the ingredients list on site, it seems like it could be the Tansy oil, which I have no clue a to why it was added. Essential oils provide no benefit other than fragrance. Since I was breaking out I thought it must be this oil at first. So I just used it once and did not use it again till I found out it could be the products mentioned above. After that, I have tried two attempts to use this product. I tried to use it at night as a face oil. The smell lingers and it can be a good thing or a bad thing(depending on your preference). It is definitely not good for the skin. I didn't experience any breakouts but it did not give me any benefits in the short period I tried to use it. The smell was just too much for me. Thus, I tried to use it as a massage oil, pre-cleansing. It worked well initially. However, I started to notice my face getting red and sensitive after a few days so I stopped. I haven't use the oil ever since. I may give it another attempt but the fragrance is a huge turn-off.\n\n***Texture:*** Lightweight, nonsticky, oily.\n\n***Another issue:*** The ingredients list [on the ](https://imgur.com/a/cQdPBJY)[pack](https://imgur.com/a/cQdPBJY) was different than the one online. I mentioned this issue to the owner as well. She did not respond to this issue. Not sure if this was just another error or if this is the correct one actually.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** Please remove the essential oil from this product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **MILK PROTEIN SHAMPOO BAR**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Cocos Nucifera \\[Coconut Oil\\], Hydrolysed Milk Protein, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, and Cetyl Alcohol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium PEG-7 Olive Oil Carboxylate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Tocopheryl Acetate \\[Vitamin E\\], Benzyl Alcohol & Salicylic Acid & Glycerin & Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My Hair type:*** Low porosity 1c-2a, scalp prone to dermatitis, was experiencing heavy hormonal hair fall during that period.\n\n***My experience:*** I purchased this after hearing a lot of hype around their shampoo bars. This did not increase my hair fall and when it arrived it looked really small but I think a little goes a long way with this one. I think it felt it was really gentle but not suitable for my hair type. It made my hair frizzier and slick at the same time although my scalp and hair both felt clean.\n\n***Status:*** May try another bar better suited for my hair type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **MOIST REPAIR HAIR CONDITIONER**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled water, Glycerine and Water and Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Organic Glycerine, Quaternium-91, and Cetrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetyl Alcohol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Water & Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit/Leaf Extract & Saccharum Officinarum \\[Sugar Cane\\] Extract & Citrus Aurantium Dulcis \\[Orange\\] Fruit Extract & Citrus Limon \\[Lemon\\] Fruit Extract & Acer Saccharum \\[Sugar Maple\\] Extract, dl-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, Benzyl Alcohol, and Salicylic Acid and Glycerin and Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My Hair type:*** Low porosity 1c-2a, scalp prone to dermatitis, was experiencing heavy hormonal hairfall during that period.\n\n***My experience:*** On the website, they claim that this can be used on the roots as well. I tried that a few times.  It felt like it left a film on my hair and my hair looked greasy like that, thus I just started applying this on my ends. It does help detangle hair in the shower and it makes hair softer. However once dry, my hair becomes frizzier and tangled after wash. Again, I feel it may not be suited for my hair type. I think people which thick hair might like this.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **DEEP CONDITIONER HAIR BUTTER WITH HIBISCUS, SHIKKAKAI & ARNICA EXTRACT**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Butyrospermum Parkii \\[Shea Butter\\], Theobroma Cacao \\[Cocoa Seed Butter\\], Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Ricinus communist \\[Castor\\] Seed Oil, Cocos Nucifera \\[Coconut\\] Oil, Aloe vera Juice, Arnica Montana \\[Arnica flower\\]extract, Water, Glycerin, Persea Gratissima \\[Avocado\\] Fruit Extract, Acacia Concinna Fruit Extract, Tamarindus Indica Fruit Extract, Hibiscus Rosa-Senensis Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis \\[Rosemary\\] leaf extract, Tocopheryl Acetate \\[Vitamin E\\], Olea Europaea \\[Olive\\] Leaf Extract, Water \\[aqua\\].Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol and Salicylic Acid and Glycerin and Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My experience:*** The website claims that this can be used as a leave-in cream as well but I just used it as a hair mask and washed after 1-2 hrs. It left my hair extremely nourished and soft but really greasy. Even after washing it with a sulfate shampoo by hair were pretty much weighed down. I think this would be good for those with thick hair. I liked it for extra nourishment. I will use this up. I didn't notice my hair falling excessively while using this. The quantity is really little though and I am not sure how many uses you can get if you have very thick voluminous hair.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **ORGANIC LIP** **~~SCRUB~~** **STICK**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Organic Cocos nucifera (Coconut Oil, Ricinus communis (Castor Seed Oil, Beeswax \\[Cera Alba\\], Hydrogenated Olive Oil and Olea Europaea \\[Olive\\] Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii \\[Shea Butter\\] and Organic Brown Sugar)\n\n***My experience:*** This product was a complete dud. Maybe I received a lip balm instead of a scrub. Maybe the sugar particles melted. Maybe my product did not have any sugar particles. I rubbed half the product to ensure that they were not buried deep inside. This was just a hard thick balm, not moisturizing at all. It has no scrub particles. This was a major disappointment. I had to contact ER for several days to get this fixed. I have no clue what went wrong with this product.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***OVERALL BRAND REVIEW:***\n\nI appreciate how candid the owner was in admitting what could have gone wrong. Her responses seemed genuine. After much discussion about the unstable formulation, I had to wait a long while before the refund was processed for the defective items. I left reminder emails for the refund which was just very embarrassing. The owner, however, provided me a complete refund for all my purchases which is kind & generous.\n\n***I hate that they did not announce the issues in their batches on their Instagram/website. A batch can have anywhere around 500-20,000 units(approx). If the whole batch was bad, I feel those customers deserve a refund/new product.***\n\nI think the brand is still in the learning stage. I think their hair products may be nice. I can see them working out for some people. The skin care products were a major no-no.  I had a lot of expectations from the brand as they position themselves to be aware and first movers in the Indian skincare industry. I was gravely disappointed to know that the formulas are not well researched and; even though the brand is big on disclosure, they are not purposely going out of their way to list the complete ingredients list. No dyes, colors, preservatives, and ph stabilizers below 0.5% will be mentioned. Their sunscreen has no PA/PPD ratings.\n\nTheir packaging for both the lip scrub and the glass dropper bottle sucks. The bamboo exterior in the packaging is lined with a plastic interior. It makes the caps and sticks bulkier and thus hard to open and close. The brand heavily advertises and markets itself to be a clean/green brand. The bamboo cap packaging just looks like a gimmick though. It serves no real purpose. I appreciate the glass containers and the aluminum pump bottles although. They feel lux. Also, all products are packaged with a lot of newspaper stuffing, which I prefer over bubble wraps. Points for that.\n\nBy their brand marketing, they are trying to cater to both scientific and natural skincare consumers. The owner in a later email claimed that they aren't running the brand for-profit and are very motivated to reinvent the skincare industry. I can see that they are motivated but I cannot see how the brand is not focused on profits. Their products aren't cheap and they have invested heavily in marketing and influencer codes. I can see ER becoming the next JC. I am just sad that my experience was not nice. I hope the brand does try to take feedback and focuses more on quality and formulation. I think the brand has a lot of potential. They have a good marketing team and are developing products that are needed in the Indian market today. All their products look very interesting. I wish they ace their formulations as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: **The brand owner contacted me that they have been getting a lot of hate since my post. I want to shout it out that it's ok to voice your criticism but any kind of bullying is NOT ok. Everyone is welcome to make purchase decisions based on what they seem fit but all our personal thoughts do not need to be aired.** **We are all human.** **Please don't send any hate to the owner. This does not mean I want to stop you from sharing your views/experiences. Just be careful of your words.**\n\n**She also let me know the steps and changes they have made following the event.** [Here](https://imgur.com/X5vr0sn) **is a screenshot of our conversation.**\n\n&#x200B;",

It seems like most of them aren’t even hiring proper chemists and cosmetic formulators but rather reading up on what’s popular abroad and DIYing in their kitchen because they believe the Indian consumer isn’t educated enough to check PH. so thanks for doing that. Also if one batches PH went wrong I hope they weren’t being cheap and informed the other people who purchased from that batch and refunded them. Or else they’re literally endangering those customers skin",

And the bottle of sunscreen was swapped with a bottle of deep ceramide moisturser .\n\nThey even went on saying that they haven't got any single negative review about copper tripeptide and phyto fuse moisturser and i hence I should continue using those two.\nI agreed...as I trusted them...( Another mistake)\n\nAll this communication started on July 28th.2020\n\nFew days back this post on reddit went viral where the owner admitted to the fact that their copper tripeptide serum was unstable . And they will recall the product. The person who wrote that post got refunded in full...\n\nSo now alarmed ...I again sent them emails...but never got any response.\nFinally I sent them DM s on instagram...\n\nWhere after much contemplation they agreed to refund me only for the copper tripeptide serum and not other two products. \n\nBut they still refused to refund me for sunscreen and phyto fuse moisturser stating some internal policies.\n\nI even asked them to arrange for a pick up of all their products from my place and refund me in full...but the owner cut me short amd asked me bluntly if they could go ahead with the refund of only copper tripeptide serum or not. I agreed for the partial refund fearing even that might get stuck.\n\nI am sad,angry , frustrated and feeling a little agitatedand cheated ..\n\n\nDone with the brand EARTH RHYTHM for ever....\nAnd yes I lost 1100 bucks of my hard earned money in the pursuit..\n\nI might be labelled as a hater or someone trying to bring down the brand.trust me I never wanted to do this on a public platform .\nI sent them dms and emails...but the double standards of that brand left me with no choice..they sold me faulty products very well knowing their own shortcomings and then deny me full refund to which I m entitled for as a customer.",

Virgin hair, never been chemically treated, I don't do any heat styling, no blow-drying. Only Air-drying\n\n[Pic 1, Im turning away from camera](https://imgur.com/a/3YQDuew.jpg). Hair is so hard so photograph properly, If I get more accurate pictures, I'll edit to add.\n\nSo life's pretty bad right now, so I'm not able to do the elaborate hair care routine I used to. Nowadays, I don't even get time to oil my hair and if you've read any of my old posts, I'd have mentioned how I never ever wash my hair without oiling. But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This is an anti-dandruff shampoo and the best I've used so far.\n\nOther than the usual supermarket brands I've used Bioderma Node Ds (Excellent but pricey. Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles. Bottle looks super tiny and the plastic waste bothers me.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Re'equil Anti-Hairfall Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:   [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-c14-16-olefin-sulfonate), [Cocamidopropyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-hydroxysultaine), [Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-cocoyl-isethionate), [Decyl Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/decyl-glucoside), [Coco-Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/coco-glucoside), [Dexpanthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Glyceryl Oleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-oleate), [Biotin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/biotin), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Nasturtium Officinale Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/nasturtium-officinale-extract), [Tropaeolum Majus Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tropaeolum-majus-extract), [Polyquaternium-22](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-22), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Glycol Monostearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycol-stearate), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Methylchloroisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylchloroisothiazolinone), [Methylisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylisothiazolinone), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Ci 45100](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-45100), [Ci 42090](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-42090)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.450 for 250 ml.

I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: Oh my god, you guys. Best find of this year. This gives super shiny, sleek looking hair. I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember. I used up the entire bottle. I think 9ish months?? or more.\n\nConsistency: Normal shampoo consistency, HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above. Forever Repurchase. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Oriental Botanics Red Onion Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients: This has an ingredients list a mile long. Will update soon.\n\nPrice: MRP 449 for 300 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years and I'm only done with half the bottle\n\nConsistency: Normal Shampoo\n\nUsage: I take a lot and apply it from shoulders to ends, if I've not oiled my hair.\n\nReview: I literally had to go and check what the name of this product was to type this review and I've been using it for 2+ years. I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

I'm not sure why this works since leaving hair in water isn't good, but it does. Between just straight up applying it and doing this, this works better. I leave it on for 5 minutes and then rinse it off.\n\nReview: This is a cult favourite  around here and for very good reason. I use this in the place of a conditioner. This conditions. I get nice, shiny frizz free hair. The cost - benefit was insane and this was HG. Not going to say anything else, because it's not available and it's pointless.  I paid higher than MRP to get my hands on a tub, when I realised it was going to be rEfORmuLAted and I've had no regrets so far.

Straight up applying and mixing it with water, both works equally well. You might use up more if straight up applying it.\n\nReview: This is brilliant protein conditioner. If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

    "body": "Hello, I got [Corsx ‘s new products : Hyrium ampule,gel cream and Centella cleansing powder](https://imgur.com/a/cNAduGY) with the benefit of free delivery as launching promotion. I used them about three days, and it's too early to write review.  However, I want to share some general feeling for those who are wondering abt it.\n\n**Skin type** dry,complex skin\n\n\n**Price** ampule -24000krw, gel cream-23000krw,centella cleansing powder -14400krw\n\n\n\n**Texture and smell**\n1. centella aqua soothing Ampule: It's literally watery. It doesn't feel sticky at all. Frankly, The scent is not fragrant; it is rather odorless. It is absorbed into the skin lightly and instantly. When I used this, I doubted,”huh, what?? 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️Is this ampule? Really?”\n\n2. Hydrium greentea Aqua Gel cream :  I hate oily cream. I always prefer gel-type cream. This gel cream is light as the ampule and is absorbed quickly into the skin. I really love the fresh texture. Though it doesn’t smell bad,nor does it smell as fragrant as flowers. There is little incense.\n\n3. Centella cleansing powder : I ordered it bc it was cheaper(to me, in Korea) than Kanebo’s cleansing powder which I liked. I don't know the difference between the two. The amount of foam from it and the feeling of washing are similar to the original. It also has no special scent. \n\n\n**Strengths and weaknesses**\n1. Ampule : 👍 It has the advantage of rapidly hydrating into skin. There is no long-lasting irritation on the face, which I feel whenever I use too heavy ampule or essence. They also do not have powerful points (like full of vitamin C or propolis blah blah) so it can be used at any time without pressure. \n\n🔺 It is difficult to replace one existing ampule. It is so light that it is more like a good toner than an ampule. I'd better add one to the existing routine. \n\n2. Gel cream : 👍It can also be absorbed quickly if applied to the face no matter how much you put on! Its cooling effect is pretty good so I will love to use in this summer weather. This is much better in soothing than the snail cream I'm using.\nSkin turns soft state right after. \n\n🔺 This is also not enough as a lone moisturizer. It's colorless and odorless, so I don't feel this Hydrium line special or unique. Of course, I think I'm used to fragrances and marketing though..I use this at the final step. It's inappropriate to change the existing cream. Also it runs out very quickly. It seems thar I can use it all within 2weeks.\n\n3. Cleansing powder: 👍It’s not stimulating skin. The foam is soft when washing. It washes away the feeling of slipperyness after makeup cleansing with oil. It is good as a substitute for foam cleansing. \n🔺 It’s dry to me. Of course it is natural to be dry after cleansing. But it is far drier so I had to run toward moisturizer. In addition, it is hard to pull the lid when compared to Kanebo’s.  Kanebo’s lid opens at once, while I had to take it off with the teeth!!😥\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Ingredient**\n1. Ampule : Water, Centella Asiatica Extract, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Betaine, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Octanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Allantoin, Madecassoside, Panthenol\n\n\n2. Gel cream :\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Betaine, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Octanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Allantoin, Madecassoside, Panthenol\n\n3.Cleansing powder : Zea Mays (Corn) Starch, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Sodium Lauroyl Aspartate, Maltodextrin, Allantoin, Centella Asiatica Extract, Lipase, Protease\n\n\n\n\n\n*My thought* :I don't regret getting the products. It's a perfect ampoule and cream for my taste and I'm satisfied. It was very good choice in this hot weather for my skin. However, I think I won’t and can’t expect any special effects like whitening. And somehow,,, I think it’s a bit pricey.\n\n\n\nP.s : I’m not good at English. So there must be grammatical and fuctional errors. Some of my expressions may not be right.😱Please let me know if anything is wrong.\n\n**edit**\nThe ingredient of centella aqua ampule.",

I personally might try it out as an alternative to my CosRX AHA/BHA Toner (although they are not the same and the CosRX is more like the Pixi in that its more inert/less active.)

    "body": "I've noticed a lot of people on this sub asking for recommendations for switching to shampoo bars, and it seems like many don't realize that there are different cleansing agents out there.  So I thought I'd put this out in the hopes that some of you will get some help when you first start looking for a bar or aren't happy with the one you have.  FYI I'm not a hair expert of any kind, I've just done a little digging on this topic and I've tried at least 5 shampoo bars over the years.  Much of this is from personal experience, so your MMV.  Please add to or correct anything here - I'm always willing to learn new things about shampoo!\n\nIMO there are 4 major cleansing types found in shampoo bars:\n\n1. sodium laurel (or laureth) sulfate (SLS): strong cleanser and present in 90% of bottled shampoo.  Many say it's too stripping, as it can cleanse away the sebum (natural layer of oil) on your scalp, leading to more oil.  If you follow the curly-girl method, this is a no go.  Present in ~~all~~ **most** of [LUSH's shampoo bars](https://www.lushusa.com/hair/shampoo-bars/honey-i-washed-my-hair/9999905563.html) \n2. sodium coco sulfate (SCS): medium strength cleanser.  Supposedly more mild than SLS (which has been true in my experience).  Not curly girl friendly but I like it for my fine, wavy-curly hair.Present in [Ethique's shampoo bars](https://ethique.com/products/frizz-wrangler) and a few from [LUSH](https://www.lushusa.com/hair/shampoo-bars/angel-hair/9999909204.html)\n3. Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate and Behentrimonium methosulfate: weaker cleansers and sulfate free, meaning it's less stripping on your scalp.  Curly girl friendly.  Present in [Hibar](https://hellohibar.com/products/volumize-shampoo) and [Love Beauty Planet's shampoo bars](https://www.lovebeautyandplanet.com/us/en/hair/products/shampoo-bar/2in1-coconut-water-&-mimosa-flower-shampoo-and-conditioner-bar.html)\n4. Soap-based bars (lots of formulas here): weak cleanser and can react badly with your scalp in hard water.  May require an apple cider vinegar rinse to remove product buildup.  I personally wasn't a fan of this method because of the residue and my hard water.  Lots of people still love them though!  Found in [Chagrin Valley's shampoo bars](https://www.chagrinvalleysoapandsalve.com/p/shampoo-bar-chamomile-citrus/).\n\nSome other notes:\n\n* So before you jump right into buying a shampoo (it's a hefty investment for many of us after all), think about what you want in a shampoo.  Do you just want to replace your Pantene/Suave?  LUSH (or something else with SLS) is your best bet.  Are you sulfate free?  Check out HiBar.  Etc.\n* No shame in alternating bars.  This is one that I don't see talked about much.  I have wavy-curly hair and I like to be sulfate free, but every once in a while (\\~ every 2 weeks), my hair needs a little more cleansing power.  So I primarily use HiBar and use Ethique every so often.  I feel like I hear a lot that \"my shampoo bar isn't working for me - my hair is a greasy mess!\"  Maybe try a stronger one occasionally or use a tiny bit of your old shampoo in the bottle you have sitting around.\n* I don't know as much about conditioners since my hair is fairly short and I don't need much.  Right now I'm using Ethique's wonderbar and I like it so far.\n* Hope this is helpful for someone!  Feel free to ask me more about which ones I've tried\n\nEdit: I've been corrected regarding LUSH.  I haven't shopped there in a year or two and didn't know they had some bars with SCS.",

Woot!\n\nI have oily skin, so I didn't find the 6.5 whip cleanser drying, but this new cleanser definitely left my face feeling more moist and smooth than the other one. It also doesn't contain any essential oils,  random plant extracts, or fragrance, so it felt very clean and didn't cause irritation. There is a slight milky scent to it but it's probably from the ingredients themselves rather than from something added in.\n\nOverall, I find this to be a pretty solid second-step cleanser - it's non-drying, very affordable, and simple. Those with sensitive and dry skin types may like to consider this!\n\nIngredients list: WATER / AQUA / EAU, SODIUM COCOYL ISETHIONATE, GLYCERIN, COCO -BETAINE, POTASSIUM BENZOATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, CITRIC ACID, TROMETHAMINE, DISODIUM EDTA, PANTHENOL, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, MADECASSOSIDE\n\nEdit: added some pics of the actual product on my hand: [https://imgur.com/a/VJgZPPm/](https://imgur.com/a/VJgZPPm/)",

    "body": "A quick review right before I shower HAHAHA.\n\nInfo:\nI have combination skin leaning towards oily. My skin is acne and clog prone and I do have some KP on my bottom cheeks/jaws. My skin is also a sensitive and moody chicken if anyone’s wondering so I’m super picky about the products I use. \n\n\nRoutine:\n\nAM: Splash with water -> Vanicream daily facial moisturiser -> some sunscreen sample lol\nPM: Dokdo cleanser -> vanicream daily facial moisturiser\n\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Coco-Betaine, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Potassium Benzoate, Sodium Chloride, Polyquaternium-67, Potassium Cocoate, Citric Acid, Fructooligosaccharides, Saccharide Hydrolysate, Disodium EDTA, Pullulan, 1,2-Hexanediol, Allantoin, Panthenol, Sea Water, Sodium Acetate, Butylene Glycol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Caprylic/​Capric Triglycerides, Beta-Glucan, Phosphatidylcholine, Hyaluronic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide NP, Glycine, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Glutamic Acid, Serine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lysine, Alanine, Arginine, Threonine, Proline\n\n\nThis cleanser had a very creamy and sticky texture. It foams a little when you rub your hands together with water. As the whole line is targeted towards sensitive skin, it is a very gentle cleanser.\n\n\nThoughts:\n\nOkay I actually didn’t really expect much from this product when I first used it. It was a huge impulse buy and I actually regretted buying it. Prior to using this cleanser, I was using the Rovectin Conditioning Cleanser and let’s just say that it was one big roller coaster haha. I switched over to this cleanser in hopes to save my skin and also because it was just collecting dust on my desk lol.\n\nThe texture is sooooo fun to play with. Even though it’s creamy, it’s also rather sticky. It’s nothing like the other cleansers I’ve tried before. It doesn’t foam up too much so my skin doesn’t feel stripped.\n\nWhile it doesn’t have any added fragrances, it does have a smell. Personally to me it smells like someone threw up in it, but some people say it smells herbal like or plastic like or mineral like. Yeah lots of different smells LOL. I thought I had bought a fake so I went and bought another cleanser (travel version) from the official store and it smells the same so rip ;-;. \n\nIt’s a no nonsense kind of cleanser, does what it needs to do and does it well. It doesn’t remove makeup that well because it’s quite gentle, so you might need a first cleanser for that. For sunscreen it depends, but I’ve heard some people just cleanse their face twice with the cleanser just to be safe. \n\nCompared to the previous cleanser I used, this one was so nice to use. It made me feel so excited to shower LOL. I didn’t get any reactions from this and in fact, some of my CCs and pimples actually went down when I started using this. \n\nIs this HG? I guess it is. I’m genuinely hesitant to call something a HG because I’m scared that my skin will go no u on me. But I guess at this moment? It is close to being one. I bought mine off of SHOPEE and it cost about SGD$18-$20+ with discount. I think the original price is about $30? I might actually repurchase this once I’m done HAHAHA.  9/10\n\nRoundlab is also well known for their Dokdo toner and I’m really tempted to try it LOL. But I have my pyunkangyul essence toner coming in soon for me to try so ummmm one day one day. My friend actually bought it and said that it’s such a good toner.",

    "body": "Ive been searching for a replacement for a good cleanser for my dry-dehydrated-sensitive skin. I thought I found my HG cleanser this year with the B Lab Matcha Cleanser which left my skin clean but soft. I fell in love just from trying a free sample from Stylevana. Unfortunately B Lab changed the formula and packaging for this cleanser. I bought the new version and hated it. It was dry and stripping like the Senka whip cleanser. \n\nSo I went through some suggestions from this sub and made a list. I was browsing a local shop today and saw the Round Lab Dokko cleanser for $11 for 150 ml and bought it. Beauty of Josean Green Plum cleanser was also on my to try list but it was $12 for 100 ml so I went with the Round Lab just cuz of the better price per ml.\n\nOverall rating: 4/5\n\nScent: mild soapy scent. Nothing offensive. Barely noticeable. \n\nI latered a dollop in my hands with water then washed my face and rinsed with water. It doesnt really foam up. It cleaned off my skincare, Etude eyebrow pencil, Lilybyred blush, Romand water tint, and Stila eyeliner well.\n\nMy skin didnt fee taut/tight. The cleanser didnt leave a weird filmy layer either. It was just my skin but clean. Its light but I wouldn’t call it hydrating — probably because of my dry skin. Best of all, no irritation. \n\n It didnt feel as soft as the og B Lab matcha cleanser though. I might explore other options after I use up this Round Lab one, but this is going to be my fallback cleanser from now on as long as the formula didnt change. \n\nIngredients: Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Coco-Betaine, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Potassium Benzoate, Sodium Chloride, Polyquaternium-67, Potassium Cocoate, Citric Acid, Fructooligosaccharides, Saccharide Hydrolysate, Disodium EDTA, Pullulan, 1,2-Hexanediol, Allantoin, Panthenol, Sea Water, Sodium Acetate, Butylene Glycol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Caprylic/​Capric Triglycerides, Beta-Glucan, Phosphatidylcholine, Hyaluronic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide NP, Glycine, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Glutamic Acid, Serine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lysine, Alanine, Arginine, Threonine, Proline",

For those of you unfamiliar with this line, it's produced by Etude House for sensitive and damaged skin types (my skin is both). It is my absolute favorite AB line so far, and I hope to review more of these products as I try them out (I am also obsessed with their pH-adjusting toner). You can find this one for about $10 on Amazon right now (I am located in the US).\n\nMy absolutely favorite thing about this product and Soon Jung in general is there is no fragrance whatsoever. It really doesn't smell like anything at all. I use the foam cleanser morning and night (after my oil cleanser at night), and my face always feels so soft afterwards, and never tight or \"squeaky\". However, it is effective at removing traces of oil following my oil cleanser. The lather is so rich and thick, and I only need about a pea-size amount for my whole face during each use. This is going to last forever! \n\nObviously, the pH of 5.5 is important as well. Not only is this close to the naturally acidic pH of skin, but it also keeps my pH low enough for my actives - like glycolic acid or salicylic acid - to be more effective (most of the ones I use are from The Ordinary, so they are not AB and won't be discussed here).\n\nThe ingredients list is fairly straightforward (taken from Amazon):\n\nWATER / AQUA / EAU, SODIUM COCOYL ISETHIONATE, GLYCERIN, COCO -BETAINE, POTASSIUM BENZOATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, CITRIC ACID, TROMETHAMINE, DISODIUM EDTA, PANTHENOL, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, MADECASSOSIDE\n\nI found citric acid (an AHA) to be an interesting ingredient, but the wash is still mild enough for daily use (or twice a day). \n\nThere is literally nothing about this wash I dislike and I don't see myself switching anytime soon. This gets a solid 5/5 stars from me for sensitive, damaged skin. This gets me super excited about trying more Soon Jung products!",

        "body": "FWIW, citric acid in skincare products, though technically an AHA, is typically there to buffer pH rather than to serve as an exfoliant. The concentration needed to keep the product pH stable is much lower than what would be needed to actually exfoliate. It’s just a convenient and cheap buffer which is widely tolerated and well established.",

I find it slightly less drying than the whip version too, cleanses my face well although it definitely wont get rid of makeup and sunscreen with silicones. the foam i got for $7 and the whip is around $13 where im from so thast def money saved.\n\nWill repurchase instead of the whip cleanser.

This review will be mainly overall experience, with some recent insights. I have more products that I have used in the past, but I decided to only review ones I have a lot of experience with so far. The only product I don't have reviewed from my routine is the Advanced Retinoid - as I just reintroduced that back into my routine in the last week.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**My current routine:**\n\n*AM*\n\n1.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n2.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n3.\tTO Niacinamide over whole face\n4.\tApply TO Caffeine to under eye\n5.\tFormula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free moisturizer over whole face\n6.\tIf using sunscreen, use Etude House Sunprise\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*PM*\n\n1.\tIf wearing makeup, I use baby oil to remove\n2.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n3.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n4.\tPaula’s Choice 2% BHA Gel to whole face – wait ~20 mins to sink in\n5.\tTO Retinoid Advanced Retinoid 2% over whole face\n6.\tMoisturize with Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Info about my skin/general experience trying out products:**\n\n* VERY oily t-zone, normal cheeks, normal-to-dry jaw line and around mouth; light-to-medium skin tone\n* VERY VERY CC-prone, mainly on my forehead (some on chin). This is mainly due to not being consistent with my routine (especially simply washing my face with a cleanser, which is the minimum I need). This can also occur from moisturizer.\n* No issues with acne, except a few whiteheads around my menstrual cycle\n* Most cleansers I have tried are either a) not strong enough or b) too strong\n* Main skin concerns: Oil control, reducing appearance of giant nose pores, preventing CCs, even skin tone, healthy aging\n* Slowly trying to reduce the number of products I use for all the things (not just skin care) that contain fragrances\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser](https://imgur.com/a/uAvebDj)\n\n***Product Type:*** Cleanser; specifically purchased because it is **sulfate free** (my body hates sulfates)\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Juice, Coco-Betaine, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Peg-50 Shea Butter, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Lycium Barbarum Fruit Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Morinda Citrifolia Fruit Extract, Punica Granatum Juice Extract, Garcinia Mangostana Fruit Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Benzoic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Red 33\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance free**; **Sulfate free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; AM: use with konjac sponge; Fragrance is actually pleasant, doesn’t linger; consistency starts off creamy, but foams very easily\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is amazing, and has been a major game-changer for me when it comes to cleansers. I’ve never found a cleanser that worked long-term before this one. A little goes a long way with this stuff – it is a very efficient clean. My face feels so soft afterwards. While it is strong enough to get rid of all my oil, it’s not so harsh that it makes my skin tight.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** In terms of function, none that I can think of. Only downfall (IMO) is it is not fragrance-free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4.5/5 stars, I’ve gone through over 4-5 bottles of this stuff and I will keep it in rotation until I can find a functionally similar product that is fragrance-free\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Thayer’s Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner](https://imgur.com/a/OwCREGs)\n\n***Product Type:*** Toner; purchased because of how many people liked it on ScA\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~0.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Purified Water, Certified Organic Witch Hazel Ext Blend (Hamamelis Virginiana Extract (Witch Hazel*), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (Filet of Aloe Vera*)), Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Water, Fragrance (Natural Rose), Citric Acid, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Seed Extract\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** ***Not fragrance-free***; Liquid consistency; potentially irritating, depending on your skins relationship with witch hazel\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Despite the smell (see below), this stuff works pretty well. I always feel like this enhances my *clean* feel following my cleanse, but it also leaves my skin feeling refreshed and moisturized. I always follow-up with moisturizer, but I can definitely tell when I don’t use it, especially in my dry areas.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** **I HATE THE SMELL OF THIS STUFF!** Come to find out, I hate the smell of roses (I’m weird, I know…) but seriously. This stuff smells like a rose pooped in some water and then sold it on the side of the road on a hot sunny day. It’s terrible. If you are remotely disinterested in the smell of rose, do not buy this.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5 due to smell. Will repurchase the fragrance-free version in the future\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%](https://imgur.com/a/Tuo5otO)\n\n***Product Type:*** Purchased to reduce redness/even skin tone and to control oil; side-benefits: helps prevent CCs\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mild medicinal smell**, doesn’t linger; Somewhat-sticky consistency; Absorbs quickly\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** I keep this in rotation mainly because it helps control my oil. Even if I use this stuff without my mattifying moisturizer, it helps prevent the massive amounts of oil that my skin normally produces. It helps keep my skin an even texture and tone, as well. I’m not 100% sure if this is solely responsible for preventing my CC (doubt it, since I use BHA), but I’m almost certain it’s contributing at the least. This product has been one that I have been most consistent with besides my cleanser and what little redness I sometimes develop (mainly due to allergies or weather) has been under control.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Functionally, none. This stuff does what it’s supposed to. I just hate the dropper packaging, personally, of most TO products. It’s hard to get the little bits out of the bottom!!\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, have repurchased 2+ times; will be replacing with skinlex’s version to avoid buying more products from Deciem.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG](https://imgur.com/a/roT93Vy)\n\n***Product Type:*** Active for reducing appearance of eye contour pigmentation\n\n***Cost:*** **$* - ~$7.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Caffeine, Maltodextrin, Glycerin, Propanediol, Epigallocatechin Gallatyl Glucoside, Gallyl Glucoside, Hyaluronic Acid, Oxidized Glutathione, Melanin, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Urea, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Xanthan gum, Lactic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Propyl Gallate, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Benzyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; Watery-to-thick consistency (from the glycerin, probably); no noticeable smell; yellow-ish in color\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I’ve been using this stuff for a little over a year, and honestly it does absolutely nothing for my eye contour. I don’t have much puffiness, but I do have decent enough under eye darkness where I wanted something to help. This does not. It does help reduce the appearance with some small, visible blood vessels around my nose, but it’s only a temporary effect thereby reducing redness. \n\n***Bad stuff:*** It doesn’t really work for what I wanted it to work for.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 1/5, WNRP.\n\n*Does anyone have any suggestions of what I can do with what I have leftover? I’d love to use it for something else if it’s functional!*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free Mattifying Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/rQeCSUV)\n\n***Product Type:*** Daytime moisturizer; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Propylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethicone, Ceteareth-20, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Silica Silylate, Behenyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Salicylic Acid, Panthenol, Fragrance, Boron Nitride, Bambusa Arundinacea (Bamboo) Stem Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Maltodextrin, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance-free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; very thick consistency; absorbs quickly; powdery/soft finish\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** Another game-changer with my oily skin. Using this moisturizer during the day saves my face from producing oil. Even if I sweat a little bit, it controls oil. Normally, without it, I’ll start producing oil within a few hours of cleansing. If I use this moisturizer, I’m relatively oil-free all day, except around my nostrils. This is also a strong enough moisturizer to keep my dryness at bay, even during the wintertime (and where I live gets very cold during the winter).\n\n***Bad stuff:*** The smell is pretty bad (probably the bamboo), but honestly I get used to it and the smell goes away quickly. My friend said it smells like wet dog... haha but I don't notice it anymore since I've been using it for so long.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, only because it’s not fragrance-free. Will continue to repurchase until I can find a fragrance-free alternative.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Sun Milk SPF50+/PA+++](https://imgur.com/a/kXZLXCa)\n\n***Product Type:*** Sunscreen; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.40 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dipropylene Glycol, Titanium Dioxide, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Viscum Album (Mistletoe) Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Carex Humillis Root Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Pinus Sylvestris Leaf Oil, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Malpighia Emarginata (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Echium Plantagineum Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Peg-10 Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Magnesium Sulfate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Methicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Aluminum Hydroxide, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Octyldodecanol, Dimethicone, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-6 Polyricinoleate, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Butylene Glycol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Cellulose Gum\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mineral sunscreen**; **Not fragrance-free**; **Mild whitecast**, but absorbs well; **Drying**; mattifying/oil-control like a boss; pleasant scent; not waterproof\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Due to drying my skin out, I only use this product when I have to. I don’t wear SPF most days (work inside, very little exposure to sun during the day), but I do wear this when I’m running errands and/or trying to control my oil more than I can with the moisturizer mentioned previously. This stuff works really well to control oil – the best of any product I’ve tried so far. Wears well under makeup, as long as my dry skin is kept controlled. Some minor white cast, but with my skin it absorbs and isn’t visible (even when I’m tanner) – but may not be the same on someone with a darker than medium skin tone.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** This product is very drying. It works SO WELL on controlling oil, but it zaps any amount of moisture out of my dry spots. To the point where I have to counteract the dryness in my PM routine. Do not recommend for people with sensitive skin, or dry skin.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 3/5, due to drying and not being fragrance-free; Will continue to repurchase until I find an alternative that controls my oil as well as this does, if ever.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Paula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Gel Exfoliant](https://imgur.com/a/X9YEexN)\n\n***Product Type:*** Chemical exfoliant; meant to prevent/reduce CCs and help with overall skin texture\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$8.80 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, (hydration), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Phytosphingosine (skin-renewing), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Vitis Vinifera Seed Extract (grape extract/antioxidant), Camellia Sinensis Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (green tea/antioxidant) Epilobium Angustifolium Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (willow herb/skin-soothing), Bisabolol (skin-soothing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH-adjusting), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; **BHA**; thick consistency, absorbs slowly\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is AMAZING! It attacks any signs of CCs overnight, and can easily clear my CC-prone forehead within a day or two. I use it almost every day as a preventative. My face has been noticeably clearer and smoother thanks to this product. Also, it visibly reduces the appearances of pores - this combined with the retinol I use has been an amazing in reducing their appearance.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Smells chemical, so may be off-putting to some people. Absorbs slowly, so you should leave room in your routine for that.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, WRP. I am going to be trying to the liquid version (I got it on sale), but if this works better for me over the liquid I will come back to it\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/BDGVfpd)\n\n***Product Type:*** PM moisturizer; light-weight\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$9.50 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Dimethicone/vinyl Dimenticone Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethaqnol, Polyacrylamide, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Dimethiconol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, C12-14 Pareth -12, Sodium Hydroxide, Blue 1\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **NOT Fragrance-free**; **Contains silicones**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; **Contains hyaluronic acid**; Very light-weight moisturizer.\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I love this product. It was the first moisturizer I tried when I embarked on my skincare journey, and I am so thankful I found it. This is the first moisturizer I used every in my life that didn’t break me out or lead to a forehead full of CCs. I’m in love with this stuff! It is light enough for my super oily spots (which is not due to being dry, it’s just oily…) and is strong enough for my dry spots. In the winter I use a little extra HA serum over my whole face and it works like a charm. I’ve been dabbling with some oils as well, but so far I haven’t found it necessary in the summer because this moisturizer works so well!\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Nothing, just that it’s not fragrance free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, because of fragrance. Will continue to RP until I can find an alternative that I can afford and is fragrance free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading, everyone! I hope this is helpful, as I use some products that you don't see a lot around here (as well as some you do...). This is definitely a more simplified version of my routine, but that may be a good thing, as I'm noticing the same effects as to what I was seeing before despite reducing the number of products I use!",

    "body": "**Review (Long Term Usage; 1+ years)** I have been using a few CeraVe products for more than an year. Putting down all the reviews at one place.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/21mqpuxa4p7c1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6152cd7496bcfdc6354819d50cab1872dd769b28\n\n**About me**: 25 F; I have combination skin with an oily T zone in summers and dry cheeks and nose in winters. I don't like strong fragrance in products, and I stay away from DIYs\n\n**Skin concerns**: Cystic acne; scars, hyperpigmentation *and* *crying* from the cystic acne\n\nAccording to the brand, All CeraVe products are formulated to be fragrance-free.\n\n*Category 1: Cleansers*\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cream-to-Foam Cleanser**\n\nTexture: Just like its described. It’s a creamy lotion texture out of the bottle. When you add water to it, it foams up and washes off like any other foaming cleanser. No noticeable fragrance.\n\nApplication: I use it two ways. First, if I want to take off any light makeup I rub it all over my dry face and it melts makeup off, then I add water it it and cleanse. Second way, I use it as a regular cleanser taking a pump in palm adding water to it and rubbing it all over my face, washing it off with water\n\n**10/10. Excellent. No notes. HG**. Already on 6th bottle. **WRP Forever**.\n\nIngredients AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, SODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE, COCO-BETAINE, SODIUM COCOYL ISETHIONATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, PCA, PPG-5-CETETH-20, PEG-100 STEARATE, PEG-150 PENTAERYTHRITYL TETRASTEARATE, PEG-6 CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC GLYCERIDES, PEG-30 DIPOLYHYDROXYSTEARATE, CI 77891 / TITANIUM DIOXIDE, ASPARTIC ACID, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, CARBOMER, GLYCOL DISTEARATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, GLYCERYL OLEATE, GLYCINE, TRIDECETH-6, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, THREONINE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, SALICYLIC ACID, SODIUM PCA, SODIUM LACTATE, ARGININE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SERINE, SODIUM BENZOATE, VALINE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, PROLINE, ISOLEUCINE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, ALANINE, PHENYLALANINE, COCONUT ACID, COCO-GLUCOSIDE, CHLORPHENESIN, DISODIUM EDTA, HYDROXYETHYL UREA, CITRIC ACID, HYDROXYETHYL ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, HISTIDINE, ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, POLYQUATERNIUM-53, POLYQUATERNIUM-39, POLYSORBATE 60, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZOIC ACID\n\n**CeraVe** **Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser (4% Benzyl Peroxide)**\n\nTexture: Translucent lotion-y texture, It’s runnier than the Cream to foam cleanser. Foams up well on wet face.\n\nApplication: It’s a wash off BP product. I use it 2x a week. I apply on face, neck and underarms. I leave it on for 5min and wash it off with water. I think it works better this way. If I leave it on for too long it does dry out my skin.\n\nI use it as a body wash too. It helped me with active acne on my face and back. I find it Better than other BP bodywashes and facewashes I tried. It doesn’t strip my skin. I do use a thick moisturiser after this.\n\n**9/10**. I cut one point for the packaging; It leaked on a flight once. **WRP**\n\nIngredients BENZOYL PEROXIDE 4%\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENTS: WATER, GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, COCAMIDOPROPYL HYDROXYSULTAINE, SODIUM C14-16 OLEFIN SULFONATE, XANTHAN GUM, POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, NIACINAMIDE, GLYCOLIC ACID, SODIUM CHLORIDE, SODIUM CITRATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, PROPANEDIOL, CITRIC ACID, TETRASODIUM EDTA, DIETHYLHEXYL SODIUM SULFOSUCCINATE, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZOIC ACID\n\n*Category 2: Serum*\n\n**CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum**\n\nTexture: Off-white runny lotion texture. Spreads easily. Not sticky, layers well under other products in my routine. No added fragrance.\n\nApplication: I started with using it twice a week and built up to every day. I use the sandwich method and layer between essence and a moisturizer. I don’t like it. It didn’t do anything for me. I noticed no difference in my skin except a slight smoothing effect. I find it to be a non-offensive beginner retinol.\n\n**5/10**. Excellent packaging. All Retinol products should come in a pump like this. **WNRP**\n\nIngredients: AQUA/WATER/EAU, PROPANEDIOL, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), CETEARYL ETHYLHEXANOATE, NIACINAMIDE, AMMONIUM POLYACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE, DIPOTASSIUM GLYCYRRHIZATE, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, DIMETHICONOL, LECITHIN, SODIUM CITRATE, RETINOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, ALCOHOL, ISOPROPYL MYRISTATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, CITRIC ACID, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\n*Category 3: Moisturizers*\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturising Lotion**\n\nTexture: Super light gel cream texture. Applies like a dream on my skin. No noticeable fragrance.\n\nApplication: I apply it after Hada Labo lotion. Used it throughout summer, great stand alone moisturizer. It was the only niacinamide product I was using at the time. I don’t like it for colder weather as my skin becomes drier. Excellent in hot weather at night. Helps oil control and the usual niacinamide things. It might feel heavy if you have super oily skin.\n\n**10/10.** No Nonsense night moisturizer in a pump bottle!!! **WRP**.\n\nIngredients : AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, NIACINAMIDE, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), CETEARETH-20, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, POLYGLYCERYL-3 DIISOSTEARATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\n**CeraVe Moisturizing Cream (White Tub)**\n\nTexture: Thick and gooey. The only CeraVe product that has a strange plastic/fevicol smell. The brand says there is no added fragrance so maybe it's just me. \n\nApplication: Applies smooth. Feels super super heavy on my face. I could just feel it sitting heavy on my skin. It didn’t give me any CCs. I used the rest of the tub as a body moisturizer. Great as a body moisturizer.\n\n**4/10.** The tub packaging too is disappointing. **WNRP.**\n\nIngredients: AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, CETEARETH-20, [PETROLATUM](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/petrolatum), POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, TOCOPHEROL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\nSorry for any mistakes.

    "body": "Hi everyone!\n\nI have accumulated a great deal of different shampoos from various indie companies throughout my time here and I thought it might be helpful to share my thoughts on them!\n\nSince everyone's hair is different, your experiences might differ from mine, so just keep that in mind! For reference, My hair is a little past my shoulders and heavily layered. It is generally limp, fine, and very straight. I find that my hair gets easily weighed down by a lot of products. I dye it red about every 5 weeks with henna and, a few times a year, I will have balayage highlights added in or touched up. My hair gets oily at the roots, in my bangs, and around my face, but the bleached ends become very dry. I wash the bangs and top of my head every day and the full length every 2 to 3 days. I blow dry, straighten, and/or curl my hair several times a week. The water in my house is on the “softer” side.\n\n**[ Cocoa Pink ]**\n\n**Shampink Conditioning Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  A favorite amongst the IMAM community, Shampink (formally Princess Poo) provides gentle cleansing without stripping or drying. The absence of sulfates means that it won’t be as likely to pull dye prematurely out of your hair. I find that this shampoo does not lather very much unless you use a generous amount, but it still cleans well enough. It is highly moisturizing, which unfortunately means that it does not provide me with a lot of lift or volume at the roots; my hair looks a little limp when I use this product, so I have to coax it more with the blow dryer to keep it from falling too flat. I tend to use this shampoo on days when I know I am going to be putting my hair up, braiding it, or doing some sort of up-do where a lot of slip is required. This is also nice to use for washing my bangs every day, as it doesn’t dry them out.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 6 oz. and 10 oz. plastic bottles with attractive labeling. Shampoo is thick and clear. Minimal lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $7.50 for 6 oz. ($1.25 per oz.) and $14.00 for 10 oz. ($1.40 per oz.).\n\n*Scents:*  Shampink comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Not as generously scented as CP’s Argan Conditioner. Also available in unscented. I have this in Cereal Killer (fruit loop type scent) and Cake on Mondays (delicious cinnamon almond cake, but beware if you are sensitive to cinnamon).\n\n*I recommend this for:*  Normal-Dry hair types, frequent washers, color-treated hair, damaged hair.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Water, Sodium Glucose Carboxylate and Lauryl Glucoside (natural surfactants), Rosemary Extract, Lavender Extract, Rose Extract, Lemon Grass Extract, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Fragrance, Mica, Phenoxyethanol and Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid (Paraben Free Preservation System).\n\n**Squeaky Clarifying Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  This is a nice alternative to CP’s Shampink if you have oily or limp hair, but still desire more gentle cleansing than most sulfate-based shampoos. I find that this formula lathers a bit better than its counterpart. It is more clarifying than Shampink, but I still would not consider it a \"clarifying shampoo\" as it is quite moisturizing. I like this when my hair is feeling a little oilier at the roots, I previously used hair spray or a scrunching product, or I got sweaty from working out at the gym.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 4.5 oz. and 10 oz. plastic bottles with attractive labeling. Shampoo is thick and light pink in color. Medium lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $6.50 for 4.5 oz. ($1.44 per oz.) and $13.00 for 10 oz. ($1.30 per oz.)\n\n*Scents:*  Squeaky comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Not as generously scented as CP’s Argan Conditioner. Also available in unscented. I have this in Lychee Rose Macaroons (sweet rose with a hint of coconut).\n\n*I recommend this for:* All hair types, gentle clarifying.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Water, Sodium Lauryl Glucose Carboxylate, Lauryl Glucoside, Rosemary Extract, Lavender Extract, Rose Extract, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium, Modified Cornstarch, Fragrance, Mica, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid (preservatives).\n\n**[ Savor Soaps ]**\n\n**Creme Fraiche Whipped Soap**\n\n*Overview:*  I have found that a lot of people use Savor’s Whipped Soap in place of shampoo. I find that it lathers very well and clarifies my hair, leaving it feeling light, bouncy, and smooth; however, I experienced a lot of dryness on my scalp and some frizziness on the ends of my hair. Many people have had great success with this and I may end up giving it another try this summer, when my scalp is especially oily. A little bit goes a long way and it is definitely a multi-use product (shampoo, body soap, shaving cream, etc.), so it is a great value! I did find a lot of unblended pieces of what looks like shea butter throughout the mixture, although this is not listed in the ingredients so I'm not sure what it is. Didn’t really bother me as it dissolves in water, but I thought I would note this. The scent lingers for quite a while after it's rinsed out!\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 2 oz. and 8 oz. plastic jars with attractive labeling. Soap is thick with a butter-like texture. Interestingly, the sugar scrub soaps had a softer texture. Generous lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $4.50 for 2 oz. ($2.25 per oz.) and $10.00 for 8 oz. ($1.25 per oz.)\n\n*Scents:*  There are a variety of scents to choose from, most of which are sweet and fruity, but there are also more masculine options available. I did not find an unscented version of the whipped soap, but you may be able to request it. Generously scented and remains in hair after rinsing. I have this in Honey (perfumey honey floral).\n\n*I recommend this for:* Normal-Oily hair types, thick hair.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Distilled water, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Sodium cocoyl isethionate, Disodium lauryl sulfosuccinate, Sodium chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Tetrasodium edta, Sweet almond oil, Fragrance, Color\n\n**[ Fortune Cookie Soap ]**\n\n**Shampoo Bar**\n\n*Overview:*  I have not had much success with sulfate-free shampoo bars in the past, so I was pleasantly surprised at how well Fortune Cookie’s shampoo bar worked for me! It lathers easily, smells great, and doesn’t leave a weird film on my hair that I sometimes get with other shampoo bars. This product provides gentle cleansing and it is very economical as a little bit goes a very long way. I find the scent to be quite long lasting as well. I use this when traveling as it takes up very little room in my bag.\n\n*Product details:*  Couldn’t find the size dimensions on the website. Bar is square and colored/decorated according to scent. Generous lather. It seems that it will last a long time.\n\n*Cost:*  $8.99 for one bar.\n\n*Scents:*  There are a small handful of scents available and good portion of them change with the seasons. They are mostly sweet, fruity, and fresh scents. I did not see an unscented version. I have this in Oh Hair (peach nectar, grapefruit, sprig of thyme) and it is pleasant and long lasting.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  All hair types, travel.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Sodium Coco Sulfate, Fractionated Coconut Oil, Kokum Butter, Cosmetic Grade Silicone (Moisturizer), Shea Butter, blend of Palm and Coconut Oils (Saponified), Purified Water, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Vitamin E (Tocopherol), Fragrance and/or Essential Oils, Cosmetic Color\n\n**[ Toadstool Soaps ]**\n\n**Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  This shampoo provides superb lather and great cleansing power without leaving my hair parched. It removes any kind of product or oil build-up easily. It is more clarifying than many other indie brands, so I always make sure to follow up with a conditioner. It is fantastic at removing grime, styling products, and skin oil. The foaming power is very impressive considering this is a sulfate-free product. A little bit goes a LONG way. The shampoo leaves my hair super clean, fluffy, and full of volume. The packaging is very basic. The larger bottle size is definitely the way to go as it is the most economical of all of the shampoos I’ve tried.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 3 oz. and 10.5 oz. plastic bottles with minimalist labeling. Shampoo is medium-consistency and clear (type of fragrance may alter color). Very generous lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $6.50 for 3 oz. ($2.17 per oz.) and $9.75 for 10.5 oz. ($0.93 per oz.) Some of the shampoos containing essential oils are a little more expensive.\n\n*Scents:*  The shampoo comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Most are very generously scented, but more subtle scents are available as well. Also available in unscented. I have this in Milk and Honey (comforting almond milk and honey) and it is one of the more subtle scents.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  Normal-Oily hair types, limp hair.\n\n*Ingredients:* Distilled Water, Coconut Oil, Cocoa Butter, Saponified Olive Oil, Vegetable Oil & is enhanced with 100% Raw Honey and Lemon Juice for a healthy shine, Fragrance Oil & Potassium Sorbate as a preservative. *Note: There is lemon juice in the ingredients, but I do not find that it lightens my hair color at all. I have read on other message boards that this is because when it is \"cooked\" the lightening quality is diminished.*\n\n**Wheat and Oat Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  I love the ingredients in this shampoo! My hair really likes marshmallow root and the slippery elm was a nice surprise (both give a lot of natural “slip” to the hair). This is a great formula that would suit most hair types, particularly if your hair likes protein. Protein can be somewhat drying if it’s used in excess, so keep this in mind when deciding what conditioner to pair it with. Toadstool also has an accompanying rinse-out conditioner that works very well with this, but if you have especially dry hair, you may want something more intense. This shampoo isn’t scented; it has its own natural scent from the ingredients, which pretty much smells lightly of grain. Not unpleasant, but I’ve just become so accustomed to crazy-scented products that it was a little bit of a surprise!\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 10.5 oz. plastic bottles with minimalist labeling. Shampoo is medium-consistency and light yellow. Good lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $10.50 for 10.5 oz. ($1 per oz.).\n\n*Scents:*  Natural scent of wheat.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  All hair types, protein lovers.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Aloe barbadensis (Organic Aloe) Juice, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Vegetable Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Avena sativa (Oat) Extract, dl-Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5), Camellia sinensis (Organic Green Tea) Extract, Urtica dioica (Organic Nettle Leaf) Extract, Stellaria media (Organic Chickweed) Extract, Ulmus fulva (Organic Slippery Elm) Extract, Silybum marianum (Organic Milk Thistle) Extract, Althea officinalis (Organic Marshmallow Root) Extract, Aphanizomenon flos-aqua (Blue Green Algae), Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid\n\n**[ Winner ] Toadstool Soap's regular shampoo because of the affordable cost, excellent lather, and availability of scents.**\n\nStay tuned for my review of indie conditioners!\n\nWhat shampoos have you tried? How did you like them? If you would like to share your thoughts, that'd be great! It would also be helpful if you included your hair type so that people with similar hair can decide if that product will (or won't) work for them.",

    "body": "After seeing [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/r613jf/my_experience_with_prose_finethin_curlywavy_hair/) on here, I was inspired to share my thoughts about my experience with Prose.\n\n**My hair:** 2A, fine-medium strands and medium density. It's at about mid/upper back in length, and the only color I have is very very grown out highlights that are near the ends. I'm pretty oily at the roots, I wash my hair every 2 days or so, and cannot go longer than that despite my many attempts to try the hair training myth.\n\n**The goals I set with my subscription:** Oil Control, shine, volume, moisture\n\n**The “factors” they included based on my zip code:** UV protection, humidity, water hardness, pollution, wind. (who knows how much of this they actually factor in but whatever lol.)\n\n**Full Ingredients lists:**\n\n*Shampoo:*  Water, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Decyl- Glucoside, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Jasmin Flower Water, Propanediol Dicaprylate, Fragrance, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Tocopherol, PPG-Caprylyl Ether, Pyridoxine, Panthenol, Jujube Bark Extract, Peppermint Leaf Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Polyquaternium-10, Tropolone, Hydrolyzed Quinoa, Kale Leaf Extract, Citric Acid, Spirulina Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Yucca Stem Extract, Arginine, Cannabidiol, Cocamidopropyl PG- dimonium Chloride, Grape Seed Extract\n\n*Conditioner:* Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Octyldodecanol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Fragrance, Cetrimonium Chloride, Birch Juice, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, PEG-7 Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Laureth-7, Polyquaternium-10, Tocopherol, Polysorbate 20, Poppy Seed Oil, Plum Seed Oil, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Cocamidopropyl PG-dimonium Chloride, Potassium Sorbate\n\n**(These lists look pretty basic to me. But I am curious on your thoughts on them.)**\n\n**The story:** I received the first order of Prose a few months ago. I genuinely liked the idea of customized haircare, so I was hopeful. Like many other people, they were *all over* my fucking IG ads, and this annoyed me but I (unfortunately) love trying new products way too much to ignore them 🙄. The set was good. I loved the scent, I loved how my hair looked, and it felt healthy & clean with each wash. It was spring at the time, and there was enough humidity in the air for my hair to have some volume in addition to these other perks. As the weather got cooler, I noticed that the formula seemed almost too conditioning for winter where humidity was much lower. This lead me to believe they did not in fact update it based on the weather in my area. My hair was very flat and limp, and occasionally felt weighed down. There was absolutely no help with the sebum control, but that was to be expected.\n\n**Flash forward to yesterday's post-** I read that the OP had very similar experiences to me *but* experienced more shedding with this product. Andddd I got to thinking. ***I, in fact, was noticing a lot more shedding than I was used to.*** I can't really recall when this increase in shedding started, because my hair was shorter when I first started using it (tiny past shoulder length)- so less hair showed in my shower drain cover. Now, my ponytail just feels a bit less thick. I can't see any bald spots or anything like that, and it is not something very severe- but the combo of seeing a lot of shedding in the shower and this less dense feeling in my ponytail made me feel just a little off. Like something just wasn't quite right. \n\nToday I decided to wash my hair with a different shampoo, a higher end drugstore one from Target called “Odele Volumizing Shampoo” which I used before Prose. And yall… The shedding was much less. Like, MUCH less. I am still shocked.\n\n\\***Let me just say\\*:**\n\n* ***I know that it is not common that a product alone causes more hairfall, and that usually there is a different or underlying reason.***\n* ***I recently had bloods and a physical and all is well with my health***\n* I highly doubt this product is actually harmful, so I am guessing that it simply caused more breakage to happen and that’s what I was seeing in the shower. But I will never really know.\n* ***This product caused no irritation or visible signs of it not agreeing with me, or I would have stopped using it.***\n* I normally would not jump to conclusions, but after seeing such a consistent amount of hairfall each time, it was too different of a result for me to not take into account. I am going to continue to use the regular shampoo and see if anything changes.\n\n**What's my point?:** Prose is ultimately a gimmick. They have very convincing ads that pray on people's fears about cosmetics and their hair health. My hair *looks* great with it, but I shed more for whatever reason and I'm not into that. I'm not sure I trust they are real chemists, either. \n\nThank you for reading!",

BoJ left my skin hydrated actually. While Skin1004 is a cream foam cleanser. It is a basic foam cleanser but made my skin smoother and fresh. It didn’t feel tight, but it feels like it’s going to be drying if I don’t immediately follow up with a toner. Other than that, I think it’s also a great cleanser especially for double cleanse.

    "body": "Hello! I received a sample of the **strawberry milkshake shampoo bar from Athame and Alchemy** for free after a discussion with the owner when they saw my comment indicating curiosity about the product and a lack of reviews. I wanted to provide a review since I had been curious to see if there had been any out there when the new one had been released last time around. In other relavent information, I have only tried the waxes from Athame and Alchemy from last year's gift exchange (thank you! I'm an exceptionally big fan of #PSL but loved everything).\n\n**Hair deets:** a couple inches short of waist length, coarse and porous, prone to frizz in higher humidity, mix of waves and curls\n\n**Typical hair routine:** wash every 2-4 days, depending on how dirty it is. Shampoo to the scalp, rinse out elsewhere. Conditioner from the bottom up, tiny bit on the top. \n\n**Experience with solid shampoo:** Tried four other brands. The only terrible one was Lush before the most recent reformulation. Absolutely dried out my hair and left it brittle and stiff. Been using my preferred brand for nearly a year now. \n\n**Other notes:** This was a free sample sent to me after I mentioned that I would be willing to try it other than the shipping cost to Canada (no one's fault!). It did come via lettermail successfully, but did not stay intact. I decided to crush it more evenly then firmly press it into a round mold. It has mostly stayed intact since. This may have changed the foaming and delivery experience. \n\n**On arrival:**\n\n- Strawberry milk scented, slightly candied a bit of juicy tartness. Not overwhelming through the packaging, could smell several inches away dry\n- Arrived crushed and powdered. Pushed into mold and got mostly cohesive product. Just under 1 tbsp of product after reforming it. \n\n**First use:**\n\n- Wet, similar scent throw\n- Surprising amount of lather (possibly due to water saturation in air pockets from press though)\n- Silky touch to the foam that built quickly in my hands (preferred for me), also easy to apply straight to hair in along length motion, but did not try to rub due to press \n- First try, washed out with normal amount of foam, but only in targeted location\n- Second go immediately after, continued to add more foam until entire top of head felt silky with foam. Rinse out very easy, felt hair was almost stripped/clarified, but not dried out (felt similarly when first time using solid shampoo, likely overwashed, oops)\n- Shampoo scent does not have strong throw after shower, though scent is more milky\n\n**Round two:**\n\n- less foamy (now normal level), still quickly foamed, rubbed a bit into hair after initial foam layer\n- slightly sour scent? \n- no lingering scent, not stripping, left glossy hair when only conditioned lower half\n\n**Rounds three - five:**\n\n- consistent with round two. \n- Still have around 3-4 uses left if it's not too small. Significantly more than what is advertised, but I would get about 10 normal uses out of it. \n- Hair feels nice and cleaned, but requires a touch up on the third day consistently. Feels like a faint residue sticks around as a hydrating layer. \n\n**Value:** good independent of the price. Very good considering the price of competitors (not including those that claim soap = shampoo that aren't pH balanced), especially as you can purchase a larger form to cut down on shipping frequency. Currently priced at 13.75/large ones.\n\n**Ingredients:** Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Rice Starch, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Rice Bran Oil, Fragrance, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Citric Acid, Germall Plus (different for the Rosemary option)\n\n**Scent:** Ripe Strawberries, Buttercream Frosting, Vanilla Ice Cream, Caramel, Spun Sugar\n\n**More notes:** My partner also used the shampoo bar once and confirmed it smelled like strawberry milk. It looks as if there are still a few more uses left. Just from eyeballing it, it looks as if the sample size is around 2/3 of the usual sample size rounds from other brands, but I could have compressed it more due to it being crushed in transit. I also forgot entirely it was strawberry *milkshake* sceented. While I can see it, my mind definitely jumps to strawberry milk first. **Overall it's a very hydrating product that feels like it leaves a thin film on the hair. Overuse can turn it into a more stripping product if that's needed. The scent is light, but present, and washes out. I did not find that my hair colour faded exceptionally fast with its use. The texture of the foam was silky and on the low foam side initially, but it was easy to build up. I did feel like I had to wash my hair slightly more freqently than with other shampoo options. Value wise, if I could stock up and not get bored for two years, I would consider purchasing these even with the horrific shipping costs. The sample size is an excellent option to just give it a go if you use shampoo at the same rate as I do (usually double the number of uses listed).**\n\nFeel free to ask more questions! I've just copied over the notes I had on what stood out to me at the time.\n\nEdit: come to think of it, that slight filmy feel I get...I wonder if it reduces frizz? I haven't noticed any more during the test runs at least. Edit 2: I've actually tried four brands! One was so mediocre and drying that I wiped it out from my memory.",

        "body": "Yes, I just got the rice milk soap from Athame and Alchemy and have so far had a similar experience! First off, it smells *really* good to me. I used a ton on the first try--really lathered it up in there--partly because it smells to good and partly because the foam does indeed feel so silky and lovely in my hair. When I rinsed, my hair felt a bit squeaky clean (not usually the goal for this curly head, but nice when I want to clarify a bit or need a deeper clean than usual) but also not super dehydrated/angry/rough like my hair can be with shampoo. Using it a bit more moderately, I like it a lot! The rest of my hair care routine needs some tweaking, so it's hard for me to say just on the basis of hair results, but the experience of using this bar is really lovey. Thank you for your in depth review!",

    "body": "Day 4/7 this brand is underrated but their products work better than other brands I know of. So this brand is cruelty-free and vegan. It focuses more on sensitive skin, clean ingredients, hydration, and improving the skin Barrier in the long term. Any skin type can use the products and the main ingredient is the olive squalene and hyaluronic acid. They also use a blend of three different hyaluronic acid sizes (they have the smallest HA size for skincare in the world). If you've ever been to Sephora and saw that expensive and much-raved brand that uses squalene oil in everything, this is a cheaper alternative. The pH of everything is a 5.5. If you are looking for something for sensitive skin I'd think this is a good brand. \n\nDisclaimer: what worked for me might not work for you. I was gifted 3 of the products last year which got me interested in the entire line.\n\nEdit : some if the products have been reformulated so im not sure how it might impact the product. \n\nDual moist toning lotion 180ml:\n\nTo me, it's not worth it and there are definitely better hydrating toners worth your money. However, if every toner irritates you and you have dehydrated skin or just really sensitive skin you will like this. This is a good hypoallergenic hydrating basic toner. My friend has eczema and acne prone skin and loves this toner but now I got her wanting the pyunkang Yul's acne line. It's more viscous than water and dispensed well also comes sealed. \n\nIngredients - Water, Glycerin, Glycereth-26, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Arginine, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ceramide NP, Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Avena Sativa (Oat) Meal Extract, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Sodium Citrate, Disodium EDTA, Octyldodecanol, Dodecane, Isohexadecane, Isoeicosane, Octadecane, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Citric Acid, Tetradecane, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Linoleic Acid\n\n❤️Dual moist comfort cream 75ml:\n\nMy favourite daytime moisturiser works well in winter and summer it's perfect if your oil-water balance is out if wack. In the summer is adjust excessive sebum so I sweat less on my face but keeps me hydrated in the winter time. Feels like a gel, absorbs fairly quickly. It's a basic essential. Uses panthenol, madecassoside, and Allantoin to soothe, repair and strengthen skin. \n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-10, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, Dimethicone, Squalane (Olive Squalane), Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Arginine, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Ceramide NP, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Butylene Glycol, Carbomer, Dimethiconol, Octyldodecanol, Dodecane, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Isohexadecane, Isoeicosane, Sorbitan Isostearate, Polysorbate 60, Octadecane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, PEG-20 Glyceryl Stearate, Potassium Hydroxide, Tetradecane, Disodium EDTA, PEG-100 Stearate, Polyglutamic Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Linoleic Acid\n\n❤️Dual moist hyaluronic Essence 100ml:\n\nclaims to rapidly hydrate even dry or sensitive skin without irritation. It does work. One if my favourite essences an alternative to the cosrx snail in terms of the hydrating effects your skin gets. If you are vegan and want the hydrating effects and healing effects of Centella Asiatica and vitamin E from tocopherol this could be great for you. My skin was soothed and cooled down, quickly. Absorbs fairly fast feels and hydrating on the skin. \n\nEdit: I repurchased this and didn't notice any actual change to the product still worked. I tried like putting drops of both on my face and I guess the new formula kept my skin more hydrated. But it still works the same but if you have an allergy to anything in the new formulation I'd pass. \n\nIngredients \n\nWater, Pentylene Glycol, Polyglycerin-3, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Collagen, Madecassoside, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, C14-22 Alcohols, Xanthan Gum, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Gaultheria Procumbens (Wintergreen) Leaf Extract, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate\n\nUpdated formula:\nWater, PentyleneGlycol, Squalane, Polyglycerin-3, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Gardenia TahitensisFlower, Tocopherol, CamelliaSinensisLeaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita(Matricaria) FlowerExtract, CentellaAsiatica Extract, AloeBarbadensis LeafExtract, LavandulaAngustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Glycerin,Cetearyl Olivate,Sorbitan Olivate, C14-22 Alcohols, Xanthan Gum, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside,PulsatillaKoreanaExtract, ZanthoxylumPiperitum Fruit Extract,UsneaBarbata(Lichen) Extract, Arginine, Gaultheria Procumbens(Wintergreen) Leaf Extract\n\nFluid oil 30ml:\n\nIf you have TO squalene oil I'll pass on this one they both have 100% organic squalene oil. This one is more cosmetically elegant but save $30 while you can if you are interested in squalene oil by itself. \n\nEmollient extra comfort cream 75ml\n\nContains panthenol too (D-panthenol contains vitamin B5) it feels sticky when applied. If your skin is dry or dehydrated or if you have combination skin but live in a dry climate you will enjoy this. It's a really heavy cream and I dislike the feeling since it takes a while to absorb but my skin doesn't feel hydrated. \n\nIngredients : \n\nWater, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Panthenol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glycerin, Squalane(Olive Squalane), Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Arginine, Ceramide NP, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Carbomer, Octyldodecanol, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Wax, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Dodecane, Isohexadecane, Isoeicosane, Octadecane, Tetradecane, Dimethicone, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Disodium EDTA, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Butylene Glycol, Glucose, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Linoleic Acid\n\nNew formulation - Water, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Squalane, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate,Cetearyl Olivate, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Canola Oil, Xanthan Gum, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Gaultheria Procumbens (Wintergreen) Leaf Extract\n\nEmollient cleansing bar\n\nDoesn't contain any harsh sulfates or anything but I don't like cleansing bars in general. Good for body and face and it won't dry your skin out if you have oily - combo skin. Honestly, there are so many better cleansing gels/milks/foams that I think work better than this bar. It's cleansing properties are abysmal at best and it struggles to remove even the minimal makeup I wear occasionally. My friend hated this too and pointed out to me that looks like it can easily get bacteria on the product. \n\nIngredients:\n\nTriticum Vulgare Wheat Starch, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Potassium Lauryl Sulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Aqua, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Avocado Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Calophyllum Inophyllum, Olea Europaea, Squalidae, Sodium Hyaluronate, D-Panthenol, Tocopherol Acetate, Glycerin, Spinacia Olearacea Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Sapindus Trifoliatus, Apium Graveolens (Celery) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Spinacia Oleracea L., Chorella, Allantoin, Olive Butter\n\nI think they are. Trying to do something cool with their brand but because what they focus on are pretty basic stuff not all people may like it. I think the dual moist comfort cream is a great moisturiser for any skin type and the essence and toner are good items. However, by making products like the cleansing bar or their clay mask (which you can't purchase anywhere anymore)... By only using this brand in my routine my skin looked dull despite being hydrated. My friend who tried some of the products with me saw her skin Barrier become healthier over the next few months and her sensitivity to products decreased slightly. Anybody with a sensitive skin type or dehydrated - dry skin would enjoy trying some of the line. You can get the brand on stylekorean.com, yesstyle, roseroseshop, or ohholly\n\nHope this was helpful i feel like it was kind of a messy review 😅\n\nEdit: It remind me of the ordinary because of the reformulation changes and how they use olive squalene (squalene derived from olives) instead of shark squalene to make it cruelty free.

I just switched to AG Haircare Volume Shampoo (with the matching conditioner) and I love how my hair looks after use. It takes care of almost all frizz, gives me gorgeous volume, and contains sulfates (something I definitely need in a shampoo). BUT, it does not feel like it cleans my scalp as well as other shampoos, despite having that \"stripping\" feeling in the shower. Now if this was 2014, I'd think I was \"over-drying my hair and it was producing more oil\" but alas, updated information.\n\n**My question:** Why can I can barely get it to lather? I don't have super hard water, and I can lather other shampoos much easier than this one. What determines the lathering level in a shampoo? \\*Side note, I have heard that lather has little to do with cleansing level of a shampoo, but I'm not sure if thats a myth or not because it sounds anti-sulfate to me.\n\n**Shampoo Ingredients:** Aqua (Water/Eau), Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Coco-Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Propylene Glycol, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Sprout Extract, Tilia Tomentosa Bud Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Humulus Lupulus (Hops) Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Prunus Serotina (Wild Cherry) Bark Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Extract, Silk Amino Acids, Hydrolyzed Keratin, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Trioleate, VP/DMAPA Acrylates Copolymer, Fragrance (Parfum), Benzophenone-4, Tetrasodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, CI 19140 (Yellow 5), CI 42090 (Blue 1), Citric Acid.",

    "body": "**Personal Info:**\n\nI live in nothern europe, so currently cold, windy and dry Climate. My Skintype is sahara desert dry, prone to closed comedones plus some light hormonal acne. Sadly im also super prone to hyperpigmentation. My main Goals are barrier health, hydration, acne & Hyperpigmentation management and getting rid of the damn stubborn CC\\`s... I also follow a kinda skincycling routine wich includes a non AB Retinal product.\n\nIn **Bold** will be the product name + how long i have been using it\n\nin *italic* will be the ingredients i liked\n\n\n\n**Axis-Y Sunday morning cleanser: (using for a month now)** *green tea extract, centella extract, allatonin*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Coco-Betaine, Butylene Glycol, Potassium Cocoate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Benzoate, Polyquaternium-67, Xylitylglucoside, Citric Acid, Anhydroxylitol, Propanediol, Xylitol, Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Glucose, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Disodium EDTA, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Agrimonia Eupatoria Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Dipropylene Glycol, Allantoin, Perilla Frutescens Leaf Extract, Saponaria Officinalis Extract, Sodium Acetate, Pentylene Glycol, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Kigelia Africana Fruit Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Natto Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxycinnamic Acid, Rutin\n\nTexture:\n\na balmy texture, foams up to a dense and soft foam\n\nExpirience:\n\nI picked this up because I wanted to change from my old clenaser to something that felt like it had a bit more cleansing power, yet was not stripping. As far as i can tell it seems to accomplish that. It foams up nicely, cleans well and doesent seem to strip my Skin. After washing it off it feels almost as if there is a slight layer on my Skin, but i dont mind it/ think that it contributes to the non stripping?\n\n(4/5)\n\n**Cosrx Propolis Toner: (about a month 1/2 of use)** *propolis, honey extract, panthenol*\n\nIngredients:\n\nPropolis Extract, Honey Extract, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Cassia Obtusifolia Seed Extract, Panthenol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride\n\nTexture:\n\na waterlike texture, thats just a bit thicker\n\nExpirience:\n\nTo be honest im not overly impressed... its a nice hydrating toner for sure but i didnt notice anything outstanding that would have me choose it again. But it gets a pluspoint for being reasonably priced so i migth pick it up again to reach free shipping...\n\n(3/5)\n\n**Holika Holika Aloe Waterproof Sungel (3 Months of use)** *Aloe*\n\nIngredients:\n\nAqua, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Niacinamide, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Caprylyl Methicone, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hippophae Rhamnoides Fruit Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Extract, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Juice, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Pentylene Glycol, Behenyl Alcohol, Poly C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Decyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, T-butyl Alcohol, Tocopherol, Ascorbic Acid, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Ceramide Np, Phytosphingosine, Parfum\n\nTexture:\n\na thin cream Texture, not runny but almost there\n\nExpirience:\n\nIt comes in quite a big size for a Sunscreen, you can find 80 - 100 ml Tubes online for around 15-17 Euros! Wich honestly was the sole reason why i bougth it xD i figured my skin would be fine with the Ingredients and i just hate tiny sunscreens! And well... that was exactly what it is like, its decently moisturizing and doesnt irritate my Skin. But if you have sensitive Skin be careful, it does have Fragrance, smells kinda like very artificial Aloe. You can smell it but only upon first apllication, it doesnt linger. I have been using 1 bottle for 3 months and still have enough for another month at min. so a win!\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n**Purito Dermide Cica Barrier Sleeping Mask: (3 months of use)** *Squalane, Centella Extract, Jojoba oil, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Ceramide*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract(250,000Ppm), Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Squalane, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Butylene Glycol, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Panthenol, Ceramide NP(3,000Ppm), Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyacetophenone, Sodium Carbomer, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract\n\nTexture:\n\nA thick Cream, feels quite emmolient\n\nExpirience:\n\nI love, love, loe this! Its the first moisturizer that i found that feels like it actually does its job well on my Skin. As a nigthtime moisturizer it keeps my Skin hydrated all through the Night and has my wake up nicely glowy. I love to use this when my Skin is irritated, it really soothes it quickly. Always have this on my Shelf, you would have to pry it out of my dead cold hands, to seperate me from it. One Bottle last me about 2 months.\n\nHG!\n\n(5/5)\n\n**Mary & May Blackberry Cream Essence: (4 months of use)** *Jojoba oil, ceramides, lotus water, centella*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Nymphaea Caerulea Flower Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit Extract, 1,2-hexanediol, Methlypropanediol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Hydrolyzed Gardenia Florida Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Trilaureth-4 Phoshate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Pvm/Ma Copolymer, Cyanocobalamin, Ceramide Np, Maltodextrin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopherol\n\nTexture:\n\nthin, watery but creamy? (just realized i suck at describing textures haha)\n\nExpirience:\n\nA really nice hydrating and moisturizing Toner, feels like a great balance of the two. Acts nicely as a layer with other Skincare because it absorbs really well. I like it, a bottle lasts me about 2 months.\n\n(4/5)\n\n**Abib Quick Sunstick Protection Bar: ( 3 months of use)** *Aloe, Centella, Ceramides*\n\nIngredients:\n\nOctyldodecanol, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Dibutyl Ethylhexanoyl Glutamide, Dibutyl Lauroyl Glutamide, Diisostearyl Malate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dextrin Palmitate, Octocrylene, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Saccharide Isomerate, Maltodextrin, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethyl Hexanediol, Ceramide NP, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol\n\nTexture:\n\nA translucent stick, glides on smooth, feels a bit occlusive on skin\n\nExpirience:\n\nNicely moisturizing Sunstick, feels good on my Skin and well... does its Job xD I really like the curved shape of it, it relly helps with the application. I just use it for reapplication of my sunscreen, but also sometimes when my Skin gets really dry during the day ( tho its not the best for that)\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n**Numbuzin No.2 Protein 43% creamy Serum: ( 4 months of use)** *Oat protein, Ceramides, cholesterol, fatty acids, ferments, Rice protein*\n\nIngredients:\n\nAvena Sativa Protein Extract, Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Poly C6-14 Olefin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Erythritol, Limnanthes Alba Seed Oil, Sodium Chloride, Allantoin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Adenosine, Dextrin, Theobroma Cacao Extract, Pantolactone, Ceramide NP, Cholesterol, Palmitic Acid, Oryza Sativa Seed Protein Extract, Stearic Acid, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Lactobacillus Ferment, Glycine Soja Protein, Hydrolyzed Lupine Protein, Glucose, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Sweet Almond Protein, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Myristic Acid, Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Arachidic Acid, Lauric Acid, Sodium Succinate, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance\n\nTexture:\n\nVery thick serum, really is creamy like the name says\n\nExpirience:\n\nSooo repairing and soothing, does wonders for my barrier. It really helps keep my Skin moisturized and helps keep my transepidermal waterloss in check. Love it so much! HG!\n\n(5/5)\n\n**Purito Aha Bha Refreshing Solution: (1 month of use)** *Glycolic acid, Salcylic Acid*\n\nIngredients:\n\nSalix Alba (Willow) Bark Water, Butylene Glycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid (7%), Tromethamine, Water, Salicylic Acid(2%), 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Citrate, Arginine, Caprylyl Glycol, Citric Acid(0.28%), Hydroxyacetophenone, Pentylene Glycol, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Disodium EDTA\n\nTexture:\n\nlike water, it put 2-3 drops on a thin cotton pad and swipe over my Face with it\n\nExpirience:\n\nSince it has only been a month i cannot say too much about how it has worked (and i feel its hard to tell what effects on my skin is retinal and whats from this product) but my comedones are reducing in size and developing into breakouts. But the effects of these ingredients are well studied in these concentrations so i would say its save to say it works. Its my first time using glycolic acid and i can say it packs a punch for sure! So be careful, its intense, so far im using it once a week on my exfoliation day and i dont think ill be moving up.... Might also be the fact that its a combo product, but i have been using salcylic acid and mandelic acid in combo before, and that felt less sensitizing. So im attributing that factor to the 7 percent glycolic acid, since it is the smallest molecule size of all Aha\\`s.\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow lets move to quick first impressions of a few products i just started trying, wich i have seperated from the review portion because i just havent been using them long enough to really speak about the effects on my Skin: (these will also be shorter impressions with less info)\n\n\n\n**Neo:labs liquid enhancer Pycogenol:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Propanediol, Hydrogenated Poly C6-14 Olefin, 1.2-Hexanediol, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Saccharum Officinarum Extract, Jojoba Esters, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Salvia Sclarea Oil, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa Root Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Theobroma Cacao Seed Extract, Melaleuca Altemifolia Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, C18-36 Acid Triglyceride, Coprylyl Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, C12-18 Acid Triglyceride, Squalene, Sodium Polyacrylate, Tromethamine, Albatreus Contuena Extract, Paimitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Phytasteryl Macadamiate, Citric Acid, Phytosterol, Dextrin, Tocopherol, Butylene Glycol, 4-Terpineol, Pentylene Glycol, Octonediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\nExpirience:\n\nBougth this because of the tea tree extract, oil and 4- terpineol for the antimicrobial and antiinflammatory benefits , plus it also promised balancing the water-oil contend of the skin. So far i have been using it for a week and it feels nicely moisturizing, but i cannot say if it has helped with my breakouts. Smells strongly like tea tree, wich i dont mind.\n\n**Isntree Spotsaver Mugwort Ampoule:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nArtemisia Princeps Extract, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Erythritol, Betaine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Piper Methysticum Leaf/Root/Stem Extract, Panthenol, Propanediol, Beta-Glucan, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Allantoin, Carbomer, Tromethamine, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\nExpirience:\n\nThis i got because i heard amazing things about mugwort and it was on a 50 % Sale, so i got it for a steal! So far i like the simple ingredient list an it seems soothing and hydrating.\n\n**RNW Der.Ceramide Cream:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Ceramide NP, Panthenol, Caprylyl Methicone, Glycerin, C12-16 Alcohols, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Ceramide NS, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Ceramide AS, Ceramide AP, Oligopeptide-1, Ceramide EOP, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Betaine, Arginine, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Carbomer, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Arachidyl Glucoside, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Stearic Acid, Adenosine, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium EDTA\n\nExpirience:\n\nIm really intriged by this brand an was debating between this and the Ceramide serum, but got this Cream. At first i was intimitaded by the essential oils and the strong smell it has (herbal, but to my nose very pleasant) so i patchtested it on my cheek. The Patchtests went fine and i have been using it on my whole face for 4 days now and i must say im impressed.\n\nIf you have oily skin i feel you could hate it but for my dry skin... the texture is amazing. Its a THIIICK cream, like an ointment, very balmy. Upon apllication it feels nice to spread it and it sinks in so well for the thick texture. The cream surprisingly dries down velvety and leaving a protective shield over the Skin. I also love that it has 3 % Panthenol, 3% ceramides and cholesterol and fatty acids.... so perfect ingrdients for skin barrier repair! Really a potential HG...\n\n\n\n",

    "body": " [Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate](https://www.lushusa.com/ingredients/13749.html) is the primary ingredient in the new Posh shampoo bar, as a replacement for the typical SLS in most others, meaning it's sulfate free! However I was under the assumption that it probably wouldn't lather much if at all given my experience with stuff like Avocado Co-wash which doesn't later much at all. Turns out that's not true and it lathers just as well as any sulfate based shampoo while not feeling like it's as stripping!\n\nProblem is, Posh is a limited Mother's day item and also it's a little messy, the activated charcoal side gets everywhere, though it doesn't stain. So hopefully with this as a 'test' they'll start making more shampoo bars with Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate instead of SLS.",

The only other one I've tried (a very cheap one) was basically a gel that didn't foam and was basically impossible to properly clean the hair with. I now have [this new one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/LOreal-Expertise-Colour-Conditioner-250ml-pack/dp/B00PL7T6JS/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1502884921&sr=8-1&keywords=l%27oreal+pure+colour) (the shampoo version) but it foams so much and honestly feels like any SLS shampoo I've used before although the foam does feel more.. dense? I've also noticed it has quite a bit of surfactants in its ingredient list:\n\n- Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate (amphoteric)\n\n- Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate (aionic)\n\n- Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate (aionic) \n\n- Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate (aionic)\n\nI just can't help but wonder if including 4 mild surfectants is just as bad as using SLS? How many should a regular SLS-free have? And that it foaming so much is a bad sign. I only use it around 2-3 times a week but I colour my hair and I like the colour to last as long as possible so if this is as stripping as SLS I'd rather find something new.\n\nSorry if this is a n00b question - I *am* a n00b but it's hard to find answers to questions about specific products.\n\nedit: added whether the surfactants were aionic or not.",

The reason you combine them is because they have different properties, and you need a variety to prevent buildup from silicones, etc., since you aren't using the powerful sulfates. \n\nImagine it sort of like this. I could clean my bathroom with a sandblaster. It would destroy every finish in the room, but that room would be clean. Or, I could use a variety of cleaners- glass cleaner for the mirrors and fixtures, bleach-based cleaners for the toilet, a soap scum cleaner for the tub- that are all much gentler, but I need the variety to do the job properly, because a glass cleaner won't effectively sanitize the toiler or remove soap scum from the tub.",

I'm listing the prices converted from the retail price in Korea so you can see whether you're outrageously overpaying if you do decide to go look for any of these online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SIDMOOL**\n\nMost products from this brand seem to fragrance-free. They're quite popular in Korea, it looks like. Sensitive skin-friendly, mid-range to very affordable price, good performance/rave reviews. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mu73nuoc8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3671e9c6328bb8cab34a24366fac08d06ace645f\n\n1. **Pure Bifida 95 Ampoule - 30ml/24,600 Won ($20.94)**\n\n*Bifida Ferment Lysate, Sodium Hyaluronate, 1,2-Hexanediol.*\n\nBifida ferment is the \"star\" ingredient that makes up most of the famed Estee Lauder night recovery serum if you didn't know (although it matters which strain was used apparently, same with SK-II & their dupes). It's said to strengthen your skin barrier over time and provide very slight, gentle exfoliation. Reviews for this Sidmool serum I have read on the Hwahae app do confirm that many people felt their skin became \"stronger\"/less sensitive. Many also said their skin tone & texture improved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pmd5qi5e8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9d487bb091642b6ee3ea1e20e2b1f4cc276b0e4\n\n2. **Skin Sauce D Panthenol Ampoule - 12ml/11,800 Won ($10.04)**\n\n*Water, Panthenol, Pantolactone, Xanthan Gum, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root (Chinese Skullcap) Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root (Tree Peony) Extract.*\n\nPanthenol is a great barrier repairing ingredient. Research shows using 5-10% is the best for skin penetration. It's said to be very healing. Note the tiny size, however. 12 ml = 0.4 oz.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kc56mwli8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af5deb3f6d7af94d6cd14851695dd3a721e599c8\n\n3. **Madagascar Real Moisture Cream - 80g/23,800 Won ($20.26)**\n\n*Centella Asiatica, Glycerin, Hydrogenated lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Paeonia Suffruticosa (Tree Peony) Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis (Chinese Skullcap) Root Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ethyl Undecylenate, Polyglutamic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Erythritol, Sorbitol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic acid, Asiatic acid, Astaxanthin, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Beta-Glucan, Panthenol, Vaccinium Angustifolium Fruit Extract, Punica Granatum Fruit Extract, Ficus Carica Fruit Extract, Morus Alba Fruit Extract, Ginkgo Biloba Nut Extract, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol.*\n\nThis lightweight gel-cream (Koreans call watery/hydrating creams \"soo boon cream\" meaning \"moisture cream\") is a crowd-pleaser, starring centella and many other soothing ingredients such as Chinese skullcap extract, allantoin, licorice root (the soothing component, not the skin-lightening), and madecassoside. It also has polyglutamic acid, beta-glucan, and hyaluronic acid as humectants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qi4q3uak8ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0af940dc986ca78892585f4a03d2fd7b23a3b96a\n\n4. **Honey Peptide Moisture Pack - 40ml/9,800 Won ($8.43)**\n\n*Honey Extract(40%), Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycerin, Glycereth-26, Hyaluronic Acid, Sorbitol, Propolis Extract,Royal Jelly Extract, Human Oligopeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-11, rh-Oligopeptide-2, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Beta-Glucan, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Caffeoyl Tripeptide-1, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Glycine Max (Soybean) Seed Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Butylene Glycol, Sucrose, Fructose, Glucose, Trehalose, Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Allantoin, Gardenia Florida Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Glucosylrutin, Arginine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\nA lightweight, gel-textured sleeping pack. This has been #1 for sleeping packs for a while now, too. Reviewers say this is very hydrating. It's absolutely *stuffed full* of humectants: honey, glycerin, hyaluronic acid, sugars, beta-glucan, collagen, and peptides. Some soothing ingredients as well, allantoin, licorice root & extracts. Very dry skinned people said it wasn't enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xfr8w5oo8ku31.jpg?width=630&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfdcfdfe41ba52ad5d588187902b7d00420478a4\n\n5. **Calendula Ampoule Moisture Cream - 80ml/16,800 Won ($14.30)**\n\n*Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Glycerin, Calendula Officinalis Flower Water, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ceramide NP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide AS, Ceramide AP, Cholesterol, Glyceryl Stearate, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Curcuma Longa (Tumeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Water, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Xanthan Gum, Dipropylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Heptyl Undecylenate, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\nA gel-cream with skin-soothing calendula flower as the star.

CoQ10 molecules are really big though, so it has trouble penetrating. Idebenone has smaller molecules so it can do the job better. I heard that the patent on idebenone ended recently, so maybe we can see more of this goodie in future products. There are also peptides in this ampoule, as well as some soothing & firming ingredients.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sdnxp8cu8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72616b051ce0532bd51287099a4e28de9871ec0f\n\n7. **Green Tea Peeling Gel - 120ml/4,800 Won ($4.09)**\n\n*Water, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Water(10%), Glycerin, Cellulose, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Betaine,Beta-Glucan, Arginine, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Allantoin, Sodium Polyglutamate, Carbomer, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Hydroxide, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil.*\n\nThis is wildly popular, being so affordable. It's a nice, basic peeling gel. Fragranced with lavender essential oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3cvgwgvv8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b79356fcf60cdd09f5435cd76817e90c5f036c1\n\n8. **Jojoba Lip Essence \\[Original Moisture\\] - 13ml/3,800 Won ($3.23)**\n\n*Polyisobutene, Petrolatum, Diisostearyl Malate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Microcrystalline Wax, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Royal Jelly Extract, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Tocopheryl Acetate*\n\nThis lil' lip balm has been #1 on the Hwahae app for a while now. Which surprises me, personally, as the Korean skincare community is going through a major \"EWG is best source/natural is better\" moment right now. But hey, I guess if it works, it works. Fragranced with orange essential oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oz9arxe39ku31.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff34a25e8bccfe68e01a8ccc85e304df7b1b0826\n\n9. **Saccharo Ferment Therapy Essence - 60ml/24,800 Won ($21.11)**\n\n*Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Polyglutamic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Saccharomyces/Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Allantoin, Human Oligopeptide-1, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Water.*\n\nI think some of Missha fermented products use Saccharomyces. Whenever you see a ferment ingredient/whatever extract, that means that plant has been fermented to make the nutrients in it more bioavailable for us. Supposedly the fermentation process releases lots more goodies than just using the extract alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/myfq67u59ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecfc805f707759f790b86d6dd65460379b6c9674\n\n10. **Saccharo Ferment Sparkle First Ampoule - 100ml/49,000 Won ($41.70)**\n\n*Galactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Polyglutamic Acid, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract.*\n\nGalactomyces = SK-II, Bifida = Estee Lauder, though which strains are trade secret or something. A very simple ampoule with ferments, a humectant and some plant extracts.

They're really not very good for your hair!\n\nThose noodles are a very strong surfactant called Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS). SLS is usually mixed with other liquid or powder surfactants to create shower gels, cleaning products, detergent bars etc. What you don't want to do is use it directly on your precious tresses. \n\n\nSo, toss that aside, and make way for the FuturePrimitive Shampoo Bar!\n\nWe have developed this bar with Eco Cert approved surfactants, which are gentle on your hair, and will not cause frizz. Inside these little gems are a host of ingredients made for gently cleansing your hair, whilst also conditioning at the same time. \nWe use Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, and Sodium Coco Sulfate, which are derived from coconut the same as SLS, but they are miles apart with regards to their makeup. SLS has a small molecular mass which enables it to penetrate the skin and affect living cells under the surface. Sodium coco sulfate is a much larger molecule coated with a kind of wax, which is too big to penetrate the skin and therefore does not have the same irritancy.\n\nSo whilst Sodium coco sulfate is a sulfate, it's not a sulfate as we know it. It's actually very mild, and cleanses the skin and hair without stripping it of natural oils. Also in these bars we have included organic shea butter, and 3 different plant proteins, which will help to protect your hair, whilst boosting it with some nourishment. \n\nWith just a few strokes across wet hair these bars create copious amounts of delicate foam, which washes away easily leaving your hair feeling bouncy, super clean, and conditioned. You really don't need to rub this onto the hair too much, a few strokes really does do the trick. \n\nThe addition of our signature Rook & Raven scent will leave your hair smelling sweet.\n\nIf needed follow with your favourite FP Conditioning Hair Rinse. \n\nEach bar weighs approx 80g, and is good for around 80 washes. \nAvailable now via our online shop and in store. \nHope you enjoy!\nTiggy x\n\n[link](http://futureprimitivesoap.co.uk/shampoo-bar/?mc_cid=6a638c2db9&mc_eid=9595b5ff59)",

    "body": "Hey folks. \n\n\nToday I’m going to review Saponificio Varesino’s Manna Di Sicilia soap. This isn’t a new soap on the market or anything, but there doesn’t appear to be a lot of literature on it around here, so hey, why not contribute! \n\n\n[Here is the album.](https://imgur.com/a/cWXRv)\n\n\nLather: SV Manna Di Sicilia\nBrush: Wolf Whiskers Synthetic\nRazor: Maggard V3\nBlade: Personna Red\nPost: Chatillon Lux Yuzu/Rose/Patchouli\n\n\nThis is the Beta 4.3 version of the soap. Evidently, they started experimenting with this soap at Beta 1.0, so it’s been through a lot of formula revisions if nothing else.  If we’re to believe more revisions = better soap, then it should be a good one.\n\n\nThe soap comes in a 5.3 oz puck in an aluminum tin (this soap is also sold standalone in the usual corrugated box/paper packaging). Soap and aluminum has always been a curious combination to me. Sodium hydroxide reacts violently with aluminum, so you have to be very sure (a) the lye is 100% gone when the soap is placed in the container, and (b) you never have the containers near the area you are soaping. I suppose with large-scale production like SV, that’s no issue, but with artisans it’s a little different. \n\n\nOk, on with it!\n\n\n**Price**\n\n\nI paid $36.95 for this at Maggard. So that puts the per-ounce price at about $7. I’m here in the US, so to be fair, I’m sure some of the cost can be attributed to import fees, overseas shipping, etc. Regardless, that makes this soap cost prohibitive to many, and I can’t fault anyone for that. After shipping, this little container was over $40.  Paying a price like that, I think it’s fair to expect a top-tier performer. \n\n\n**Attributes**\n\n\nI’m very drawn to soap processing and ingredient lists, so I apologize in advance for the long-windedness of this section. \n\n\nEven though SV is a high quality product, I think it’s important to remember that it is definitely not small batch production. The description says “…worked in a plodder, extruded, and cut by hand”. I’ve only read about this kind of stuff, so I'm definitely not an expert, but this seems to indicate that this soap has been through what can generally be described as soap finishing. In the artisan shave soap world, soap finishing doesn’t really exist. In commercially produced soap lines, however, saponification is only the precursor to the finishing steps. In the finishing line, the soap “base” (raw soap) is in the form of chips or noodles. The raw soap is mixed with fragrance, additives, colorants, etc. The plodder-extruder is perhaps the most critical machine in the line in that it forms the soap into a consistent, homogeneous texture with the help of a vacuum chamber. Soap can then be cut and stamped.\n\n\nAs for the ingredients, it’s definitely a complicated formula. I look at a lot of shaving soap labels, and with this one, I had to look up a good handful of ingredients because I’d never heard of them before or didn’t know how they were used. It’s is a vegan soap, and as far as I can tell the “base” consists of coconut oil, stearic acid, and sodium cocoyl isethionate. Sodium cocoyl isethionate is a detergent that’s gained popularity in shaving soap recently. (See B&M’s Reserve soap formulas, for example). Never used it myself, but from what I’ve read it’s mild, lathers well, and isn’t bad for the environment, so it’s got a lot of appeal.\n\n\nThere’s a host of oils that appear to make up the superfat. The way I look at it is that – on labels that list saponified content – oils that DON’T end in -ate must be the superfat. I see about 7 different kinds. \n\n\nPerhaps the most unique ingredient is the fraxinus ornus sap extract (manna ash). This appears to be the namesake of the soap. From what I can glean, the fraxinus ornus is a tree found in Europe. Its sap has historical use in many different applications, but most of them medicinal. According to SV, it’s used in the soap because it is a “highly softening emollient”. So I’m guessing beneficial for post shave properties? Never heard of this one. \n\n\n**Scent** \n\n\nI really, really, really wanted to love this scent. Reading about the fragrance profile and knowing the long history of the company, I knew a lot probably went into the scent development. I love YRP by Chatillon Lux, and the notes are quite similar, so I was certain I would dig this. But I just… don’t really like it. \n\n\nThe official note profile is:\n-Top: Orange, Bergamot, Sage\n-Middle: Rose, Clove, Hydrangea\n-Base: Cedar Wood, Sweet Pathouli\n\n\nI suppose this would be considered a chypre – which in general, I usually like - but what really turned me off was the acidic “punch”. You know how mentholated soaps or aftershaves have a nostril-clearing punch upon first inhale? Sometimes citrus can have a similar impact on my nose. It isn’t always bad, but this one felt extremely bitter to me. Borderline metallic. \n\n\nOff the puck what first hits me is the highly acidic orange. A second or two into the discovery, it’s mostly floral to me. The floral portion of this scent is actually quite pleasant. If I close my eyes and really try hard, I do pick up the sour “feeling” of the patchouli and a woody base. I swear I smell sandalwood every time for a fleeting moment right before I pull my nose away from the puck, but evidently it’s cedar wood.\n\n\nThis isn’t my thing, but the good news is that scent is subjective. So you may love it!\n\n\n**Performance**\n\n\nThe performance of this soap is a redeeming quality, no doubt. I have pretty hard water, so I load every soap of mine for about 40+ seconds by default. Dense clouds of lather were spilling out of the tin at that point. A thick, insulating layer of soap was extremely easy to attain. I say “insulating”, because that’s what the best soaps seem to feel like (at least to me). The lather is so dense that you’re almost able to feel it retain heat against your face. That’s what this was. \n\n\nThe slickness was very impressive, but I do have one caveat here. In the pattern I shave my face, I leave the portion right around my Adam’s apple for last. I do this to make sure the hair in that area can retain as much moisture as possible before it’s shaved, because that area tends to be the most sensitive. I can always tell when a product starts to dry out, because I notice the lather in that area begins to “crack”. That happened with this soap; not in a major way, but noticeable. That’s not a dealbreaker for me, as I notice the same thing in Proraso products and it doesn’t ruin the experience, but it does take away from the slickness and detract from otherwise excellent performance in this case. You never want to feel like you’re in a race against the clock when you’re enjoying a nice shave.\n\n\nThe post shave was absolutely, completely, utterly amazing. Like, probably-the-best-post-shave-I-can-remember, amazing. I couldn’t believe how great my face felt afterwards. When coconut oil is near the top of the list in an ingredients label of a shaving soap, I immediately assume two things: (1) the soap will probably lather well, and (2) I need to watch out for a drying feeling on my face afterwards. Sodium/potassium cocoate is an incredibly effective surfactant, which means it removes oil and grime wonderfully. But that’s not always a good thing – especially in the context of shaving soap - as it can leave your face feeling dry and unnourished. Soapmakers offset this effect by using other oils with more mild properties, building in superfats, adding moisturizing ingredients, and/or using ingredients with some nice unsaponifiable content. Perhaps the reason for the incredibly intricate ingredient list in this formula was to get at a truly superior post-shave/moisturizing product. And if that was the intent, hats off to SV, because this is a fantastic execution of it. I wouldn’t have used or needed a post shave product, but I just didn’t care for the lingering smell of the soap, so I needed to cover it up (also… Yuzu/Rose/Patchouli – ‘nuff said).\n\n\n**Verdict**\n\n\nI’ve got my own funny way of judging how much I’m really in love with a shaving product, because it’s easy to get caught up in the newness of something. I imagine the product being stolen from me, and then ask myself if I would buy it again to replace it. This little mental exercise takes into account the fact that you’ve already spent money on this product… would you do it again just to make yourself whole? It’s a straight up value question. I absolutely would for my L&L and B&M reserve line soaps.\n\n\nIn this case, I think I would, in fact, buy the product again, but it barely crosses the threshold. And I would pull out my wallet while I bit my tongue a little bit. The scent really kills it for me (but again, scent is subjective). HOWEVER, having a soap with such strong post-shave performance really adds an element to my shave den that I want to have at my disposal. The lather itself yields a texture and quality consistent with something you would expect at this price point, in spite of the fact that there are some minor drying issues. The ingredient list is complex, diverse, and unique. \n\n\n*Positives*: triple-milled (lasts a long time), ease of lather, quality and density of lather, slickness, exceptional post-shave performance\n\n*Negatives*: scent (for me), minor drying concerns, price\n\n\nCheers everyone!",

It is almost as it you have to build up to a veritable lather with SV, and, for the other two, you have to add water to soften it. Definitely think that SV has its niche though, and I use it as my second and third pass soap, with the first pass going to either Clarus form the Grooming Dept. or anything from Sudsy Soapery!

If you're not a bath person or don't have time, a tablespoon in about 1/4 cup warm water massaged into your hair and scalp (let sit for a few in the shower then rinse a bit) makes your hair sooooo silky and fresh! Works better than a CO wash in my opinion. All natural ingredients. It does have [sodium cocoyl isethionate](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/706048/SODIUM_COCOYL_ISETHIONATE/), which is a very mild, vegan, and no poo safe ( [for most people](http://m.wikihow.com/Determine-if-a-Hair-Product-is-Curly-Girl-Approved) ) surfactant from coconut oil. Yes a know, that one kind of toes the line since it's used as conditioner and a cleanser. It doesn't add build up or strip your hair though, so you're good! \n\nWhat makes it even better is that one pouch (2.5 oz) was only $1.25 at the grocery store. Enough for one bath or 4 hair rises. [Amazon has](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B000219ZSU/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1455146169&sr=8-1&pi=SY200_QL40&keywords=aura+cacia+foam+bath) a tub of it (14 oz) for just under $10 and several different scents. \n\nI've used only this for about a month to test it out (once a week since I started working out more) and can say that my hair is a less frizzy, silky, and has more volume than doing my normal CO wash.  No itching or dandruff (why I switched to no poo in the first place years ago) came back. It feels much nicer than your plain baking soda solution. Or ever the honey/lemon/baking soda rinse (previous favorite).  \n\nTl;dr try it, you'll like it. ",

    "body": "(TLDR: They discontinued Neutrogena Creamy Fragrance-Free Ultra-gentle Daily Cleanser, which fixed my tretinoin-related dryness/rash. I need to find a new *extremely bland/hypoallergenic creamy* glycerin/water-based cleanser, but tretinoin has made my lower face SUPER reactive and dryness-prone. **List of preferences, cleansers I tried/am considering, and current routine below the dashes at bottom**. I've maintained the results in the first photo. The cleanser ingredients are in the second photo. After that, photos are in chronological order from the start of the reaction to the healing process, with cleansers listed in text. No other products were adjusted.)\n\nA few months into using tretinoin, my skin became EXTREMELY red/irritated/rashy/reactive. I suspect it may have either been an extremely damaged skin barrier or possibly perioral dermatitis, but never had it diagnosed (peak pandemic at the time and couldn't be bothered to get a referral). \n\nMy cleanser ended up being extremely important in the recovery process. Not to be dramatic, but when I started using Neutrogena's **CREAMY formulation** of the Ultra-gentle Fragrance Free daily cleanser *everything changed*. It didn't sting, make my skin tight, or cause redness/bumps. It actually felt MORE comfortable after washing. Within a few weeks my skin was a normal color again and flare-ups of the rash/dryness became much less severe and eventually disappeared completely. My skin *loves* this cleanser. I've been using it for 4 years and my skin looks unbelievably dewy and clear and I regularly get compliments on it. (Pictures included) I still feel occasional dryness/tightness around my nose/mouth/chin if the air is especially dry, but I can completely avoid rashes/flaking by temporarily reducing tretinoin and applying extra aquaphore when I feel it starting to happen.\n\n**Unfortunately, Neutrogena decided to break my heart and replaced the creamy cleanser with a \"cream to foam\" version that sucks absolute butt**. They're really playing up the whole *\"repairing the skin barrier\"* thing with the new line, but it's SO much harsher than the old creamy cleanser.\n\nThe best thing about the cleanser was how few ingredients there were (only 11). It was pretty much just glycerin and water. I've been having a hell of a time finding other creamy cleansers in general (why must everything foam??) but when I do, they've got tons of \"extras\" in there (ceramides, niacinamide, Hyaluronic Acid, various plant extracts or oils, etc.) and I'm very much afraid they will trigger my skin.\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(**Creamy cleansers I've already tried +  Cleansers I am considering + Current routine all listed below**)\n\nThings I am looking for:\n- **the BLANDEST hypoallergenic creamy cleanser you know of; very few ingredients and absolutely nothing \"special\" added**.\n- **Water and Glycerin** as first two ingredients \n- **Creamy soap-free formula** (foam dries/irritates my skin — I don't think it's just an SLS thing; Oil cleansers don't really work for me, and tend to trigger the reaction + make acne on forehead worse.)\n- **Fragrance-free**\n- **No Hyaluronic Acid** (90% sure I'm allergic)\n- **No exfoliating ingredients/actives** (I know some people can handle a little, but I am unfortunately not one of them)\n- **No botanical extract/plant extract/essential oil** or anything else clearly marketed as \"something special/ancient they found in a secret forest/ocean that sets this cleanser apart from everyone else\" (I personally see this stuff mostly as a marketing gimmick, and if you are prone to reactions like me, it just increases the odds of a rash by 1000%)\n\nCreamy cleansers I have tested:\n- **Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser** - tested it on hands last week (because of trust issues). Felt nice while washing, but my hands were itchy and tight 20 minutes later. *Ingredients that were different from my current cleanser*: sodium benzoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, xanthan gum, panthenol, citric acid, niacinamide, pantolactone (note: citric acid and niacinamide are both in the glossier serum I use, so I don't *think* I react to them.)\n- **CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser** - Tried this before I found my discontinued cleanser. It stung like nobody's business and my rash always looked and felt worse immediately after using. I'm considering another go, but I'm scared of it tbh...\n\nCleansers I am considering/curious about:\n- [**SVR Sebiaclear Cream Cleanser**](https://ca.svr.com/en/products/sebiaclear-creme-lavante) (Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Niacinamide, Behenyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Xanthan Gum, Zinc Gluconate, Decyl Glucoside, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Glyceryl Stearate Se, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Phytate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate)\n\nMy current routine:\n- cleansing (AM/PM): Neutrogena creamy fragrance free ultra gentle daily cleanser (RIP)\n- AM products: Glossier super pure (niacinamide+ zinc) serum, Indeed labs squalane oil, Eucerin Urea Repair (5%) replenishing face cream (*LOVE this*), Jamieson Vitamin E Deep Nourishing Day Cream (dryness-prone areas only), Aveeno positively radiant SPF 30 moisturizer, Supergoop unseen sunscreen, Vichy Capital Soleil tinted mineral sunscreen. Aquaphore over dry spots (as needed; usually just near nose in winter)\n- PM products: Eucerin Urea Repair (5%) replenishing face cream, Jamieson Vitamin E Deep Nourishing Day Cream. Aquaphore all over face on tretinoin-free nights.\n- *Trenton every other night*: regular PM products, then add Retin-a Micro (0.04%) and an extra layer of Jamieson moisturizer on top. ",

It's very creamy/milky, it doesn't foam or even really lather, fragrance-free, no hyaluronic acid or any other actives or exfoliating ingredients, no essential oils (does contain chamomile flower extract, though).\n\nIt's the gentlest, most no-frills cleanser I've ever tried. I switched back to it after struggling with dryness & flaking with tret, and it's helped massively. If nothing else, it comes in a little 4oz version for $16 USD, so if your skin doesn't agree with it, at least you won't be stuck with a huge bottle.\n\nMy other, more tentative suggestion would be HoliFrog's Tashmoo Water Lily cleanser, which *does* have water and glycerin as the first two ingredients. It's very similar to Stratia's cleanser, but does contain 3 plant extracts (water lily root extract, lotus flower extract, and spirulina extract). It's also more expensive than Stratia's 4oz version for only slightly more product.",

So just know that not all of these options may be viable for you depending on your specific concerns.\n\nThere are lots of additional options on Etsy, but I didn't want to go down that rabbithole. Also, don’t forget to check your local farmer’s markets, grocery stores, health-food/bulk stores, and big-box stores!\n\nLinks are listed with the location where the company is based, along with any shipping options. Some of these may be available in stores (online or brick and mortar) outside of the listed location, so don’t automatically rule out a link just because it isn’t listed with your country. For example, Ethique is made in New Zealand and listed under NZ here, but their products are readily available in US. *Items are listed in no specific order.*\n\n# Shampoo/Detergent Bars\n\n**US**\n\n* [Qua Organic Hair Care](https://www.quaorganichaircare.com/index.html) \\- US/CA, international shipping unknown.

Most places also only sell one kind or the other, so it works well to break up the list.\n\nBlack or curly-haired folks, [there's also great write-up for you here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/comments/fwraq5/zero_waste_hair_care_guide_for_black_or_really/). [Or here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/comments/pyaw9t/zero_plastic_products_for_black_natural_hair/). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**“Soap”** is saponified oil. Bar soap is typically made by mixing sodium hydroxide (lye) with oils, so in the ingredient list for a soap, you’ll see oils at the top of the list and sodium hydroxide relatively low (or not at all), *or* sodium \\[oil\\]-ates, like sodium cocoate or sodium palmate (these refer to the saponified form of the oil; sodium palmate is saponified palm oil.) Most soap-based solid shampoo bars will be “superfatted”, or contain some extra oil in the formula so that they don’t dry your hair out. They may also contain other ingredients that are intended to moisturize, detangle, or “detoxify” your hair. Soap has a relatively high pH and our skin/scalps have a relatively low pH; this is one of the downsides that people will point to when discussing soap-based shampoo products. I encourage you to do your own research and decide if this is an issue for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**“Detergent”** is a synthetic detergent. This can include [sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/706110/SODIUM_LAURYL_SULFATE/), [sodium coco sulfate](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/706033/SODIUM_COCO-SULFATE/), [sodium cocoyl isethionate](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/706048/SODIUM_COCOYL_ISETHIONATE/), [sodium lauryl sulfoacetate](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/706111/SODIUM_LAURYL_SULFOACETATE/), and probably a bunch of other ingredients I don’t know about. Unless you’ve been using liquid Dr. Bronners, the liquid/bottled shampoos you’ve used are most likely detergent formulations. This can sound very scary and unnatural, which is why I linked to the EWG pages for each of the ingredients. I encourage you to do your own research into these ingredients and decide whether they’re right for you to use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter reviewing forum posts, we seem pretty evenly split on the soap vs. detergent thing. A lot of people agree that when you switch from your standard shampoo to a soap-based shampoo bar, there’s a transition period where your hair may feel waxy or greasy. A lot of people say that rinsing with apple cider vinegar helps with this. If you have hard water, that may exacerbate the the waxy/greasy feeling. You can also make a [powdered acidic hair rinse](https://www.humblebeeandme.com/powdered-acidic-hair-rinse/), if you don't enjoy smelling like ACV or you're travelling. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I’ve had no luck with soap-based shampoo -- I was never able to stick it out long enough to get through the transition phase -- and “hair feels gross” is one of the more common complaints I saw in posts asking for recommendations. That said, I've seen \"hair feels gross\" posts by people using detergent bars too, and tons of people are recommending soap-based products, so to me, that’s strong evidence that plenty of people are perfectly happy with the soap they’re using on their hair. *Personal care products are* ***personal.*** Your mileage may vary. If you hate something on your hair, try it as a hand or body or dish or laundry cleanser. **And please don't go throwing out your existing shampoo because something on this list sounds exciting. Finish what you've got first!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a side note, r/nopoo also got a lot of mentions. It looks like they may have some good coping strategies for the \"gross\" phase and some additional product or routine recommendations, so that's definitely worth checking out too, especially if you're of the mind that this whole post is entirely too consumption-focused. (Sorry. Like I said, people were asking. I'm just trying to consolidate.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*If you believe I am mistaken about any of the above, I welcome corrections. I made soap once and watched a lot of YouTube videos, and that's my the extent of my \"expertise.\"*",

It solved the stickiness in my case, hopefully it might work for someone else.\n\n\nBack when I used liquid shampoo I used to put a dollop on my head and mix it in circles and really scrunch up all the hair. With bar shampoo that made it really hard to rinse out and it left a residue. I tried working up a lather and instead smoothing it over the hair, with the grain (does that phrase work here?), and then working it in small circles without tangling the hair and rinsing it out in much the same way",

    "body": "While I love an oil cleanser in the winter, when my skin is dryer, in the summer I usually go for rice powder cleansers. These are powders that lather when you mix them with a little water in your hands or apply them to a damp face. The powder grains gently exfoliate before they dissolve, and the cleanser rinses off cleanly but doesn't strip my skin. I also love that powder cleansers are easy to travel with. No leaks, and they don't contribute towards liquid limits at airport security. \n\nLately, I've been using [this one by SRB](https://www.amazon.com/Rice-Bran-Cleanses-Brightens-Exfoliates/dp/B01DZDIJSS). Tatcha also makes a cleanser in this category, though I've never used it because of the price and the high pH. I've been thinking about making a similar product — not a straight dupe of the SRB, just a rice powder-based cleanser that works in a similar way. Has anyone ever DIY'd anything like this? \n\n**Ingredients for Stabilized Rice Bran Enzyme Powder Wash:** Zea Mays (Corn) Starch, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Seed Extract, Pollen Extract, Allantoin, Collagen, Betaine, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sorbitol, Isopropyl Palmitate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Papain, Fragrance\n\nI'm having trouble guessing where the 1% mark is on this list. Could 1% be Pollen Extract and everything below? Or Allantoin? Or is it a lot lower than that?\n\nI'd probably start by playing around with the first four ingredients: corn starch, the surfactants SCI and Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, and rice bran extract, since I bet those are the heart of the formula. I might add a touch of aloe powder, and I have Sorbitol on hand, too, if that's doing anything here. Citric Acid is presumably there to adjust the pH (I tested SRB a while ago and the pH was 5.5). \n\nPapain, Betaine, Pollen Extract, Grapefruit Seed Extract — are these ingredients doing anything beneficial for skin in a rinse-off product like a cleanser? I'm assuming a lot of things present here (Allantoin, Collagen, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Titanium Dioxide, etc) don't have any significant skin benefits in this application, although they may be doing other things for the overall formula, texture, color, etc. I'd still leave them out. \n\nI also want to experiment with adding other ingredients. I was thinking goat milk powder and colloidal oatmeal as potential additions. What else could be good? \n\nIf you have any advice or experiences to share I'd be so grateful, thank you in advance! I will be sure to post back if I come up with a recipe :)",

It would depend a lot on how much you use, I think.\n\nPapain and betaine can be considered chemically active as skincare, and pollen extract may help keep those actives at the top of your skin for a while (kind of a small difference in the timing of how the product works...if that makes sense). Like most citrus, grapefruit seed extract has Vitamin C, a possible skin brightener. It wouldn't be on your skin long in this context, and they may have put it in for marketing. Hard to say. \n\nIf you are wanting something more soothing, you might want to remove the Grapefruit, add propolis/honey (I'd do that in place of the pollen, myself). Read up on papain and betaine, see if you think you want those effects. I am careful around papain (use it all the time in the kitchen).",

The company was established in 1945 by Dante Bardelli and it has a long standing tradition of making vegan based, hard puck shaving soap. In addition to shaving soap, they also sell bath bars and shaving accessories.\n\n\n70th Anniversary is a chypre scent with notes of Orange, Bergamot, Sage, Rose, Clove, Hydrangea Cedarwood and Sweet Patchouli. This is a bright and pleasant scent that opens citrusy with bergamot and orange before the floral notes of hydrangea and rose pop into the accord. The scent is delicate and inoffensive in the truest sense. Scent strength on this soap is mid off the puck and moves to mid-light upon lathering. Comparable scents that can be found in “wetshavedome” are Lebelle Soaps Classico and Catie's Bubbles Mille Chypre. \n\nSaponificio Varesino utilized their Beta 4.1 soap base for this release, which debuted back in 2015. This vegan base is touted to provide superior slickness and post shave. Ingredients are listed as: Sodium Cocoate, Potassium Stearate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Rapeseedate Sodium, Sodium Sunflower, Aqua / Water / Eau, Shorea stenoptera Seed Butter, Fraxinus Ornus (Manna Ash) Sap Extract, Parfum / Fragrance, Ternifolia Macadamia Seed Oil, Sucrose Cocoate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Starch, Xanthan Gum, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Sodium Chloride, Tocopheryl Acetate, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Citric Acid, Benzyl Salicylate , Limonene, Citral, Alpha Isomethyl Ionone, Linalool. The hard puck loads easily in both natural fiber brushes as well as synthetic brushes. The soap is not overly thirsty but does reward the user with a merengue like lather with proper hydration and agitation. The slickness on this soap, both primary and residual are very good, not elite, but better than average by a substantial margin. Post shave is good, but not as good as I expected based on the claims and other reviews I encountered. This soap base receives a shave score of 85, which places it alongside soap bases such as Dr. Jon’s and Blackship Grooming.   \n\n---\n ****Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, \nsponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.* \n \n* Soap - Saponificio Varesino 70th Anniversary (loaner)  \n\n* Brush - ​Carnavis & Richardson “Industry” (loaner)\n\n* Razor -  Wade & Butcher “Clear” (gift)\n\n* Post - Saponificio Varesino 70th Anniversary (loaner)  \f",

Details copied from the scent page:\n\n“Cascadian Mermaid Pre-Order: The scent of a dank mermaid in the Pacific Northwest. Terpene concentrate accord, uplifting grapefruit, cotton candy, Moroccan blue chamomile, vanilla-laced sugar cane, warm rain, wild-harvested spruce tips, and shimmery mermaid musk. \n\nA fruit scent with both herbal and fresh aspects. \n\n**PRE-ORDER**\n\nQ: How does this work?\n\nA: Cascadian Mermaid will be available for sale until 4/4/25. Due to batch sizes, it requires 50 units to be sold to meet our minimums. If less than 50 units are sold by 4/4/25, all orders will be cancelled and refunded. If 50 or more units are sold, we'll create batches and begin shipping right away. All orders will ship by 4/30/25. IMPORTANT: If you order other items with the pre-order, your other items won't ship until the pre-order ships.

I still have the Kale-alu-yAHA Toner in my stash to be used sometime this summer/fall though. Other than that I have reviewed everything from the line and the hits have been the Beet Shield and Great Barrier Relief. One miss (for me) was the Oat So Simple Water Cream…and I’m sorry to say this cleanser is another.\n\nThe Match Hemp Hydrating Cleanser is a thick/jelly-like water based cleanser that focuses on mild cleansing while imparting some hydration to the skin. Featured ingredients here include Green Tea Leaf Water, Green Tea Leaf Powder, Hemp Seed Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Oat Kernel Extract, and Soapbark Extract. There are little “bits” of what I think is the Green Tea Leaf Powder floating around in the jelly here and there…which ads to the interesting look of this amber/green jelly.\n\nMy first impressions of this cleanser were pretty positive. I was intrigued by the texture…and that was only heightened when I applied it to damp skin. This jelly doesn’t really “break down” in water right away like a typical water based cleanser. Rather, it almost smoothes out and creates a really slippery/slidery (LOL) layer that is actually kind of fun to play with. After about 10-15 seconds or so…the Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser does foam up slightly and become more “traditional” in style. \n\nEven with the lower amount of foam or lather, I found this cleanser to be decent at removing any residual impurities left behind by my first step cleanser (or by itself in my AM routine). I even began taking to adding just a bit of this to a whip maker that I use…creating a much more intense lather. I usually only did this in my AM routine as that is when I take a shower (and the whip maker lives in the shower/I’m too lazy to grab it at night). Either way, I got pretty much the same result with both methods. \n\nAlthough I didn’t really feel like this cleanser was “hydrating” my skin…it didn’t feel like it was drying or stripping in any way. That was until about two-three weeks into the trial.\n\nI began to notice a slight dry/tight feeling around my jaw line and forehead after using the Match Hemp Hydrating Cleanser after a few weeks. It wasn’t an all at once/glaring problem, but maybe just after my AM routine and then a day or two later in my PM routine…I just felt like I couldn’t even make it to my actives or toner without feeling kind of dry. Of course other factors play in to the inconsistency…some days I had just exfoliated the night before and others I had maybe used a poor sunscreen during the day (hi Cell Fusion!). But where other pH balanced/gentle cleansers dont intensify the effect…over time the Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser did.\n\nBy then end of my trial I was really looking forward to moving this cleanser out of my routine. I don’t want to knock or “ call out” the scent here…but I am. Krave Beauty doesn’t use synthetic fragrance and this product is essential oil free as well which is honestly a great thing. But the scent that does come through (for me) is kind of “industrial” in a way LOL…I guess kind of like plastic. Its not unbearable by any means, but for me it wasn’t great. Each time I used this product I looked back to my time with the Sulwhasoo Snowise EX Brightening Cleansing Foam as a very fond (although essential oil filled) memory. \n\nAside from all of that (results, scent)…I think I just have to come clean and say I don’t think these thicker/jelly style cleansers are for me in general. I wrote my review of the Then I Met You Soothing Tea Cleansing Gel in 2018 and going back to it now I was shocked by how similar my review of that product was compared to what you’ve just read. “Texture is thick/unique, smells okay, made my skin dry after a while…”…literally the same flow and talking points (although I hope I have improved my skincare review game in that time). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dgkfl4slnmt41.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0629b1c0fd6de31259da451ee33d2fc741e91bf2\n\nSo, I’m not sure what it is. I could try cutting back to only one water cleanse a day or maybe I need to change how much I use (about a large pea sized amount…which probably only makes sense in my head LOL). Or, maybe the formulation of these thicker water based cleansers just doesn’t agree with my skin for whatever reason. Regardless, I just don’t see myself coming back to this product or being able to wholeheartedly recommend it. I have one more (actually two since I bought it during a 1+1 sale on Jolse) cleanser that from what I’ve seen matches this style…its the OneOSeven Low pH Chaga Cleanser and I’m hoping it will change my mind.\n\nAnyone looking for a gentle and effective hydrating cleanser with the added boost of antioxidants/calming (which the Matcha/Green Tea in this Krave Beauty cleanser offers) should really check out the Youth To The People Superfood Cleanser. To me, it is superior in nearly every way. I found that product to be very gentle and hydrating to the point that it almost doubled as a toner for me. The consistency, texture when lathering, and application were also much more my style (decent amount of lather from a thinner product). And, the fresh cut greenery/refreshing scent is really something special. All of that in a product that costs just slightly more per oz than the Krave Beauty Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser.\n\nI hear so many people rave about this product and it feels so wrong to go against the grain here. But I felt the same way about the Then I Met You cleanser…not for me.\n\nFull Ingredients List: \n\nCamellia Sinensis Leaf Water, Water, Glycerin, Coco-Betaine, Methyl Gluceth-10, Ethoxydiglycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Sodium Chloride, Butoxydiglycol, Diglycerin, Glycereth-26, Xanthan Gum, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Powder, Quillaja Saponaria Bark Extract, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Cannabis Sativa (Hemp) Seed Oil, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Diethoxydiglycol, Coco-Glucoside, Caprylyl Glycol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Decyl Glucoside, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Butylene Glycol, Octanediol, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Citric Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sodium PCA, Disodium EDTA\n\nWhere To Buy (Krave Beauty Site $16.00 USD): [https://kravebeauty.com/collections/shop-all/products/matcha-hemp-hydrating-cleanser](https://kravebeauty.com/collections/shop-all/products/matcha-hemp-hydrating-cleanser)",

    "body": "TL;DR Foaming cleanser with Coco-Glucoside was too stripping. Started experimenting with the emulsion-cream formula (Sodium Polyacrylate, oils, Glycerin, surfactants/solubilizers) – better but still too strong. Got some random papules. Need help with a cleansing formula to make it less stripping but without residue that might contribute to acne. A simpler version of Cerave Hydrating Cleanser dupe left a residue, got some papules and one nodule because of it.\n\nDetailed version:\n\nSince simple foaming cleanser with just 2.7% Coco-Glucoside (and less=no foam) was too stripping to my combo (oily-normal-dry) skin I started experimenting with non-foaming emulsion-cream formula.\n\nI used Sodium Polyacrylate (Cosmedia SP) as an emulsifier and thickener. 1-2%, then found that 2 was too much.\n\nI used some surfactants/solubilizers with it, usually Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate at 0.5-5%. 2-5% was too strong. Every time I tried to add Coco-Glucoside (with an additional thickener, like Xanthan Gum), it was too strong, usually, 4 uses and my skin was crying for help. Even with oils, which I describe below.\n\nThen I added some oils, usually caprylic/capric triglyceride or grapeseed oil. 2-5%. Anything below 5% was too strong. I wonder, maybe Cosmedia is just too good at emulsifying sebum on the face. I still want to use it because it feels great at distributing it on a wet face and it's easy to rinse off.\n\nSo it mostly looked something like this:\n\n* 4-5% Oils\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 0.5-2% Surfactants/solubilizers\n* 1% Sodium Polyacrylate\n* 1% Phenoxyethanol & Ethylhexylglycerin  \n* Lactic acid to pH about 6.\n* Then I tried something simple like:\n* 4% Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 2% PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate\n* 1% Sodium Polyacrylate\n\nIt was still a little too strong, but sebum production lowered and my skin calmed down a little.\n\nNext, I tried something like this:\n\n* 2% Grapeseed oil\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 1.1% PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate\n* 0.85% Sodium Polyacrylate\n* 0.5% Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate\n\nToo strong. Added more oils to 5% total. It's better, but my dry areas are still tight (cheeks) and normal areas a little tight. And now I have a problem with 2-5 papules on oily areas (forehead).\n\nSo I'm not sure what could I change and what's causing inflamed pimples – maybe it's still too stripping or it's because of some PEG-7 residue? I read that it's a surfactant AND a refatener.\n\nSpeaking of residues – I tried to make a simpler version of Cerave Hydrating Cleanser dupe:\n\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 2% BTMS-50\n* 2% Cetyl Alcohol\n* 0.5% PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate\n* 1% Phenoxyethanol & Ethylhexylglycerin  \n* 0.5% Glyceryl Stearate Citrate\n* 0.5% Hydroxyethylcellulose\n\nI used it like 4 times and didn't like it as it left a powdery residue (I think it's a BTMS and/or Cetyl Alcohol?) and I got some papules and one nodule. It was 16 days ago. I read that BTMS can break some people out badly, I wonder if maybe these papules that I've been getting lately was still because of a cleanser with BTMS that I used 4 times 2 weeks ago.\n\nI know it's not a place for acne, but I think it was important to mention it. I think most of my acne is because of just using too stripping cleansers and/or a residue of product.\n\nI am open to suggestions, I can replace Sodium Polyacrylate with something else, but it's hard to get some emulsifiers/solubilizers here in Poland so I'd like to use it.\n\nI use a simple cream after cleansing:\n\n* 5% Dimethicone 350 CST\n* 4% Betaine\n* 2% Sodium Polyacrylate - I think I'll lower it to 1-1.5% because it's a little too thick and it dries too quickly. Or maybe add something like Sorbitol?\n* 1% Phenoxyethanol & Ethylhexylglycerin  \n\nHere's a list of emulsifiers/surfactants/solubilizers (except ingredients which I described above) which I can buy here I Poland:\n\n* Olivem 1000 - I'm afraid a little that it'll contribute to acne, even in a rinse-off product.\n* Creamy Base 1-1-3 *(Aqua, Glycerin, Sorbitan Laurate, Polyglyceryl-4 Laurate, Dilauryl Citrate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate, Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Trilaureth-4 phosphate, Lauryl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin)*\n* Self-emulsifying creamy base *(Glyceryl Stearate Citrate (and) Sucrose Stearate (and) Sucrose Distearate (and) Polyglyceryl-4 Cocoate (and) Cetyl Alcohol (and) Sodium Ricinoleate)* \\- it contains Fatty Alcohol and I'm not sure if it contributed to acne or it was just BTMS.\n* Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate - the description says it needs to have 15-40% of oils to be stable, so I think it's not a good idea for a cleansing formula.\n* Glyceryl Monostearate - it needs to have pH >6.8\n* SLP *(Sorbitan Laurate, Polyglyceryl-4 Laurate, Dilauryl Citrate)*\n* Polysorbate 20, 80, 85\n* *Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate* \\- Again, Fatty Alcohol\n* Simulgel Thickener (Sodium Acrylate / Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer & Isohexadecane & Polysorbate 80) - maybe it would be a better option than just Sodium Polyacrylate\n   * Or this: Emulcold Extra (Sodium Acrylate; Acryloyldimethyl Taurate; Dimethylacrylamide Crosspolymer; Isohexadecane; Polysorbate 60)\n* Polawax (Emulsifying Wax NF)\n* Gosulin IL *(Isoamyl Laurate & Isoamyl Cocoate) -* not an emulsifier, but I read it can be used to wash off dimethicone easily.\n* Carbomer - I think it can't be used alone to emulsify, but it works well with Sodium Polyacrylamide, so I can use less Cosmedia and lower pH >6 without loss of a viscosity \n* Surfactants:\n   * Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside (O110) - I read that it's harsher than Coco-Glucoside.\n   * Decyl Glucoside (O10) - same concerns as above.\n   * Lauryl Glucoside\n   * Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids - it's a new ingredient in a shop, I haven't made a research about it yet.\n   * Cocamidopropyl Betaine - I think I'm allergic to amphoteric surfactants or it's because of some of it binds to the skin? My skin is itchy after I use it a couple of days in a row.\n   * Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate - same as above.\n   * Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate - a product with it made my hands very dry, so I think I don't want to use it on my face. Which is sad because studies have shown that it's one of the mildest anionics...",

Not sure if you’d be able to find that ingredient in your area. \n\nThe product I got has 25% active surfactant matter, and I use it at 4% in my formula, so the surfactant in the end-product is 1%. \n\nI just used distilled water, a thickener (could be some kind of gum), 0.2% Hyaluronic Acid (instead of glycerin), the SCG (surfactant), and preservative.\n\nIt’s obviously more a gel cleanser than a cream. It doesn’t foam. I just gently massage the gel around my face. It’s enough to get my pores clear. Doesn’t leave any residue. \n\nIf you needed it a bit stronger you could try 5% sodium cococyl glycinate (that’s calculating for a product with 25% active surfactant matter). \n\nAnother thing-  if you want to try a different oil in your formulas, you could try Neossance Squalane (from sugar cane). It is non-irritating and non-acnegenic. Doesn’t have any astringent qualities. Very lightweight but conditioning oil.",

Might also be worth trying without PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate or Sodium Polyacrylate to tell if they are irritating you individually. You can also try a blend of surfactants. Commercial cleansers utilises a mix of surfactants to increase the micelle size and gentleness.

I've been reading AB since a long time but this is my first  post here :D \n\nMy end-of-the-year haul from Testerkorea has a few items that are out of stock so I was looking for something to replace them. I was interested in a serum with ceramides and came across this cleansing stick (not a serum but it's called cera, yay keyword!)\n\nSu:m37 MRCS broke me out and I was hoping this one wouldn't have coconut oil. On So'Natural website [HERE](http://www.sonatural.co.kr/FrontStore/iGoodsView.phtml?iGoodsId=SONAH020) there is the ingredient list in Korean. The second ingredient is Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate. It's derived from coconut oil so I'm scared my skin won't like it. However, I saw it's non-comedogenic (while coconut oil is). Maybe the molecule(s) I cannot tolerate in coconut oil is not this one... :D but I don't think I'll risk it...Do you know if  Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate is comedogenic?\n\nHas someone tried this stick? Does someone know the brand? I'm really curious about this stick?\n\nPS I'm sorry if there are editing mistakes...!",

AFAIK the components of coconut oil that may be comedogenic are the small fatty acids such as lauric acid.\n\nGasoline comes from the same source as mineral oil but you would not put both on your face!",

The company prides itself on having all aspects of production based in the US. From manufacturing from the chemist to the designers to the tube manufacturers, the product is 100% made in the U.S.A. Helmsman can be purchased direct from their site or on Amazon ([https://www.amazon.com/Helmsman-Mens-Shaving-Cream-Irritation/dp/B074W272LB/](https://www.amazon.com/Helmsman-Mens-Shaving-Cream-Irritation/dp/B074W272LB/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHelmsman Original Scent is a light, refreshing scent that smell similar to many modern mens soaps and grooming products. This pleasant scent is hard to distinguish individual notes from. In general it is refreshing, clean and crisp. This scent is a nice divergence from complex scents and as such, Mrs. Ruds is neutral on this one. She cannot really smell it once I rinse it away, making it a great user if you want your post shave product or fragrance of the day to dominate. Scent strength is light to mid out of the container and remains that way through the shave. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHelmsman brushless shave cream appears to be a vega based cream. Ingredients are listed as: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Purified Water, Stearic Acid, Sodium Methyl, Cocoyl Taurate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Decyl Glucoside, Glycerin, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Coco-Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Hamamelis Virginiana, Bark/Leaf/Twig Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Siloxanetriol Alginate, Caffeine, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Glycine Soja Germ Extract, Boswellia Carterii Resin Extract, Silybum Marianum Fruit Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract, Calophyllum Tacamahaca Seed Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Fruit Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Oleic Acid, Sodium Gluconate, Ceramide, Sodium Chloride and Citric Acid. Being a brushless cream, this cream can be applied with your hand or a brush but does not require water. Primary and residual slickness are good. I am able to buff without visible lather with no fear of the razor skipping or dragging. Post shave is also good. I am not left dry or tight once rinsed away. The ShaveScore for Helmsman Shave Cream is an 82. For similar performance I suggest you check out: Castle Forbes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Helmsman Shave Cream (promotional gift)\n* Brush - N/A\n* Razor - Rockwell 6S (purchased)\n* Post - Aqua Velva (purchased)",

    "body": "Does anyone know of a good conditioner with water-soluble silicones? For the past month or so I've tried cutting down on my use of silicones and sulfates (only use a sulfate shampoo once a week or so because my hair feels too gross without it), but overall my hair feels worse than before. About a month ago I bought some natures gate products, because I really like how they're relatively inexpensive and also vegan/cruelty free. \n\nFor anyone who's curious: \n\nThis is the ingredients list for the shampoo I've been using: Water, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, sodium cocoyl isethionate, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, lauryl glucoside, glycerin, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract, panthenol, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, borago officinalis (borage) seed oil, tocopherol, ascorbic acid, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, equisetum arvense (horsetail) leaf extract, geranium maculatum (geranium) extract, salvia officinalis (sage) leaf extract, mimosa tenuiflora (mimosa) bark extract, ascorbyl palmitate, polysorbate 20, leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, glyceryl undecylenate, citric acid, fragrance (parfum)*\nMade in the USA from globally sourced materials.\n* Phthalate free\nNo - sodium lauryl/laureth/coco sulfates, phthalates, butylene glycol, artificial colors.\n\nAnd this is the ingredients list for the conditioner - Water, Glycerin (Vegetable Derived), Stearyl Alcohol (Vegetable Derived), Cetyl Alcohol (Vegetable Derived), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Vegetable Derived), Benzyl Alcohol, Stearalkonium Chloride (Vegetable Derived), Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Hordeum Vulgare (Barley) Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Fruit Extract, Viola Tricolor (Pansy) Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hydroxyethylcellulose (Plant Derived), Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Fragrance*.\n*Phthalate free.\n\nMy hair feels straw-like even in the shower, there's no slip unless it's absolutely coated in conditioner and then as soon as it rinses out it feels gross again. I also feel like my hair is falling out more often (if I pull at the tips, long strands will start coming out in the shower). I don't really know what to do. I feel like my hair gets buildup pretty easily because when I've tried cowashing with thick shampoos or have put oil in my hair it always feels really weighed down and greasy the next day. I also have a lot of problems with an itchy, flaky scalp. \n\nI was thinking that using a conditioner with water soluble silicones would be the best compromise - all the benefits of silicones but without the buildup. \n\nDoes anyone have any product recommendations? *I've also been looking for a heat protectant spray* that contains water soluble silicones, since I usually straighten my hair a bit to get rid of the really weirdly shaped waves. I've started using a bit of salt spray in my hair as well (not that often), but I feel like it's been drying out my ends. I considered mixing a bit of conditioner or oil (I've heard jojoba is closest to the scalp sebum) into the mix to make it less damaging, but I have no idea what the salt is doing to my hair with or without silicones. On one hand, it seems like silicones would protect my hair from the salt penetrating it too much. But on the other, it would also prevent the moisturizing ingredients from penetrating my hair, so it seems like a catch-22. I do think I need silicones though, because my hair just doesn't seem to be doing too great without them.   \n\nI'm sorry for such a long post! But if anyone could help me, that would be wonderful.

You might want to find a protein free conditioner to use and only use the protein one once every couple of weeks.\n\nAlso salt spray will just dry out your strands and make your hair feel coarse. I'm not sure why you are using salt spray if your straighten your hair. It's more likely to make it wavy and crazy.\n\nIf you use heat I'd maybe get a silicone heat spray/serum and just use it on the parts you straighten. Silicone WILL wash out if you don't use it in every single product and it will help to protect your hair from heat.\n\nWhen not using heat. Use an oil on your ends to keep them soft.\n\nHope that helps :)",

Also: the Sonia Kashuk face oil is dumb and don't even bother with it. Also: once the SK face mask shows up at Target, I'll be trying that also. Also!  \nAny tried any of these and have insights?

I also have a bad habit of scalp picking due to severe anxiety (that I'm trying hard to cut), I know tea tree is drying as the small portion of spillage on my forehead is dry....    \n\n\n\nI used to use coconut oil as a hair mask but I stopped cause I can't stand the smell and it's so hard to get out too. I had to shampoo 3x and then my scalp would be dry again ugh.    \n\n\n\nI can't find the products recommended for dry sensitive scalp in my local drugstores so I buy products with similar ingredients cheap and accessible to me.    \n\n\n\nQuestion 1 : does this mean tea tree doesn't work for me? A lot of the recommended conditioners have all these ingredients of the petal fresh, this brand is really cheap and accessible to me too. Where did it go wrong?    \n\n\nQuestion 2 : the products recommendations page recommended tresemme naturals conditioner but It was discontinued and I read reviews that says it has to be used as a leave in and not a rinse conditioner.

I have chronic topical allergies which means extremely sensitive skin, and to date this is the ONLY cleanser that hasn't irritated it, provoked acne and/or dried out my face. \n\nSadly it appears that it's no longer being sold; the only trustworthy looking website carrying it and shipping to the U.S is for some reason not accepting orders. And the company's website has vanished from the internet. \n\nI'm DEVASTATED. I need a new cleanser ASAP. So far I've discovered that my skin hates any kind of alcohol, sodium chloride, any fragrances, and any weird essential oils. Typically if a product has a long ingredients list.. it's going to upset my skin. \n\nThe ingredients in my original cleanser were as follows: \n\nWater, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Butylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Illicium Verum (Anise) Fruit Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\nIt also had a perfect 5.5 PH value. I tried Native's vegan alcohol free cleanser but the PH must've been off because it immediately made my skin oily. I also looked into Vanicream but saw people saying that the PH is in the 6-7 range, a range I have had a bad experience with :( Plus both of those contain sodium chloride.. \n\nIf anyone can help me find a dupe or something similar to TVG's I greatly appreciate it! Since no longer being able to buy it, my skin has rapidly deteriorated..",

        "body": "I also have severely sensitive skin. I wanted to share a tool I've been using to find dupe products or products without ingredients that are troublesome for me.  \n\nINCI Decoder: https://incidecoder.com/  \n\nHow to use:  \n\n1. Leave the search box blank (in order to capture all cleansers, since they could be named \"cleanser,\" \"wash,\" or even creative names like \"Swipe Clean\" (by Bybi)). Just click the magnifying glass.  \n\n2. Under \"Must Contain All Of These Ingredients,\" type the names of your favorite products' ingredients and select them from the autocomplete window.  \n\n3. Under \"Must Not Contain Any Of These Ingredients,\" enter any ingredients that you don't want.  \n\n4. Click \"Filter\" and you will get a list of matching products, sometimes spanning multiple pages.  \n\n5. Sometimes nothing matches the exact ingredients list you provided. To loosen the filters, click on the \"X\" next to any ingredients in the \"Must Contain\" box.  \n\nI've been using this tool for years. And even though I still struggle with cleansers, INCI Decoder has helped me find niche ingredient products that I otherwise would never have found on Google. A lot of them end up being from Canada or Europe, like Denmark, Germany, Italy, and The Netherlands. I repeatedly find vegan and cruelty free as well as fragrance free and so-called hypoallergenic products from those countries. Again, products that my English Google searches likely would have missed. So it's an amazing tool. But the database only has products entered by users.  \n\nI went ahead and searched for a cleanser fitting some of your criteria:  \n\nErhalogy (or Erha21) Skin Barrier Facial Wash (I substituted cocamidopropyl betaine for lauramidopropyl betaine)  \n \nEtude House Cica Balance 5.5 Foam Cleanser (lacks a few thickeners and humectants from the Vegan Glow cleanser)\n\nRael Daily Detox Oil to Foam Gentle Cleanser (has olive oil and quite a few plant extracts, which might not be desired)  \n\nYou can also make the following substitutions of similar ingredients:  \n-lauramidopropyl betaine: cocamidopropyl betaine, coco-betaine  \n-decyl glucoside: coco glucoside, lauryl glucoside, caprylyl/capryl glucoside  \n-1,2-hexanediol: propylene glycol, propanediol, caprylyl glycol, pentylene glycol, butylene glycol, 1,2-butanediol  \n-sodium cocoyl isethionate: sodium lauroyl isethionate, sodium cocoyl methyl isethionate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, sodium cocoyl sarcosinate  \n\n\nGood luck and hope you find a dupe cleanser!  \n\nETA: I'm unfamiliar with the products mentioned above, so their vegan and cruelty free status needs to be confirmed with the vendor. Beyond the vendor I would also check Cruelty Free Kitty's database. Some companies lie about or use ambiguous language to claim that they don't test on animals (but then still do in countries like China, for example). Cruelty Free Kitty audits companies for truly cruelty free practices.",

    "body": "Alright, this was both a very easy and very hard review to put together as my views on this Water Based Cleanser are probably a little biased LOL! You see…this Cleanser saved my life…\n\nLOL, not that dramatic but pretty close. If you remember (or don’t) I decided about a month ago that it would be an excellent idea to use an “all-natural” Bar Soap that had been listed as okay for use on the face. WRONG LOL…over the two plus weeks I used it I ended up stripping my Skin, clogging my pores, inviting breakouts, and generally messing everything up.\n\nWell, after that experience I really needed to switch to something that was going to reverse what I had done to myself. This Make P:rem Cleansing Foam jumped out since it has been recommended by a few bloggers as being great for Sensitive Skin. \n\nThe first thing that I surprised me about this Product was just how creamy/foamy it truly is. Most pH Balanced Cleansers do a decent job (at best) of foaming up…but this one feels really thick and luxurious. Especially after mixing it in my Nooni Whip Maker…WOW! The closest pH Balanced Cleanser I can compare it to is the Sulwhasoo EX Brightening Cleansing Foam. \n\nAs for the Formula…there are a couple of Ingredients that do raise some concern. The Coconut Based Surfactants (not an issue) followed by a few Essential Oils (can be an issue). I didn’t have a problem with them but I would hesitate from recommending this as the ultimate gentle Cleanser as Essential Oils pose a problem for some. Bergamot Oil and Sage Oil are both here. In addition to the Oils we also have Raspberry Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, and Citric Acid (which I assume is there to help lower the pH). \n\nEssential Oils aside…this Cleanser brought my Skin back from the brink so fast I was truly shocked. The foam feels so comfortable and luxurious…and the mild herbal scent was relaxing. Just after a few uses my Skin seemed to be less red and the few angry red bumps I had developed were much more calm.\n\nOver the past few weeks I have fallen in love with this Product LOL! Usually I am not a fan of such a “basic” Cleanser. Give me some antioxidants, give me some brightening…something! But, this Make P:rem Safe Me Cleanser was exactly what I needed in the moment. I came in and quietly said “I’m just gonna pop in here and fix this.” and went on its way.\n\nMy struggle with wholeheartedly recommending this Product (aside from the plastic bottle) is that I think my view is a victim of circumstance. If my Skin was happy and healthy at the time I brought this into my Routine I could totally see myself as calling it boring, basic, or not doing that much. And again, those Essential Oils would keep from saying its the new go-to for Sensitive Skin peeps.\n\nPersonally, I plan to keep the rest of this bottle as my “In Case Of Emergency…Use This” Cleanser. For those that aren’t particularly triggered by Essential Oils (LOL)…this is an excellent go to for days when your Skin is feeling overworked or (in my case) you made a bad call with another Product. I feel like I would even put this one above my other favorites from Peach & Lily and Youth To The People (for the purpose of bringing Skin back to a happy state) as its creamy consistency adds a bit of comfort/luxury that Gel Style Cleansers have a hard time matching.\n\nFull Ingredients List: \n\nWater, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Coco-Betaine, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Potassium Benzoate, Sodium Chloride, Polyquaternium-67, Potassium Cocoate, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Oil, Sodium Acetate, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4bm67gdhtjo41.jpg?width=1240&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=451d64d229f10607a1c6d82b5ef104d11f6adfdb",

I'm used to my Amore ($90) one being an excellent exfoliator, but I wasn't expecting this one to also exfoliate as well as remove my makeup. Added bonus! I'm definitely picking up another one as this one is less than half of the price of my Amore, lasts longer and acts as a cleanser as well. SOLD.",

I still have the Kale-alu-yAHA Toner in my stash to be used sometime this summer/fall though. Other than that I have reviewed everything from the line and the hits have been the Beet Shield and Great Barrier Relief. One miss (for me) was the Oat So Simple Water Cream…and I’m sorry to say this cleanser is another.\n\nThe Match Hemp Hydrating Cleanser is a thick/jelly-like water based cleanser that focuses on mild cleansing while imparting some hydration to the skin. Featured ingredients here include Green Tea Leaf Water, Green Tea Leaf Powder, Hemp Seed Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Oat Kernel Extract, and Soapbark Extract. There are little “bits” of what I think is the Green Tea Leaf Powder floating around in the jelly here and there…which ads to the interesting look of this amber/green jelly.\n\nMy first impressions of this cleanser were pretty positive. I was intrigued by the texture…and that was only heightened when I applied it to damp skin. This jelly doesn’t really “break down” in water right away like a typical water based cleanser. Rather, it almost smoothes out and creates a really slippery/slidery (LOL) layer that is actually kind of fun to play with. After about 10-15 seconds or so…the Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser does foam up slightly and become more “traditional” in style. \n\nEven with the lower amount of foam or lather, I found this cleanser to be decent at removing any residual impurities left behind by my first step cleanser (or by itself in my AM routine). I even began taking to adding just a bit of this to a whip maker that I use…creating a much more intense lather. I usually only did this in my AM routine as that is when I take a shower (and the whip maker lives in the shower/I’m too lazy to grab it at night). Either way, I got pretty much the same result with both methods. \n\nAlthough I didn’t really feel like this cleanser was “hydrating” my skin…it didn’t feel like it was drying or stripping in any way. That was until about two-three weeks into the trial.\n\nI began to notice a slight dry/tight feeling around my jaw line and forehead after using the Match Hemp Hydrating Cleanser after a few weeks. It wasn’t an all at once/glaring problem, but maybe just after my AM routine and then a day or two later in my PM routine…I just felt like I couldn’t even make it to my actives or toner without feeling kind of dry. Of course other factors play in to the inconsistency…some days I had just exfoliated the night before and others I had maybe used a poor sunscreen during the day (hi Cell Fusion!). But where other pH balanced/gentle cleansers dont intensify the effect…over time the Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser did.\n\nBy then end of my trial I was really looking forward to moving this cleanser out of my routine. I don’t want to knock or “ call out” the scent here…but I am. Krave Beauty doesn’t use synthetic fragrance and this product is essential oil free as well which is honestly a great thing. But the scent that does come through (for me) is kind of “industrial” in a way LOL…I guess kind of like plastic. Its not unbearable by any means, but for me it wasn’t great. Each time I used this product I looked back to my time with the Sulwhasoo Snowise EX Brightening Cleansing Foam as a very fond (although essential oil filled) memory. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/29zlo3kanmt41.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d081566bd104fc2e56f887caadc25376a7cb09b8\n\nAside from all of that (results, scent)…I think I just have to come clean and say I don’t think these thicker/jelly style cleansers are for me in general. I wrote my review of the Then I Met You Soothing Tea Cleansing Gel in 2018 and going back to it now I was shocked by how similar my review of that product was compared to what you’ve just read. “Texture is thick/unique, smells okay, made my skin dry after a while…”…literally the same flow and talking points (although I hope I have improved my skincare review game in that time). \n\nSo, I’m not sure what it is. I could try cutting back to only one water cleanse a day or maybe I need to change how much I use (about a large pea sized amount…which probably only makes sense in my head LOL). Or, maybe the formulation of these thicker water based cleansers just doesn’t agree with my skin for whatever reason. Regardless, I just don’t see myself coming back to this product or being able to wholeheartedly recommend it. I have one more (actually two since I bought it during a 1+1 sale on Jolse) cleanser that from what I’ve seen matches this style…its the OneOSeven Low pH Chaga Cleanser and I’m hoping it will change my mind.\n\nAnyone looking for a gentle and effective hydrating cleanser with the added boost of antioxidants/calming (which the Matcha/Green Tea in this Krave Beauty cleanser offers) should really check out the Youth To The People Superfood Cleanser. To me, it is superior in nearly every way. I found that product to be very gentle and hydrating to the point that it almost doubled as a toner for me. The consistency, texture when lathering, and application were also much more my style (decent amount of lather from a thinner product). And, the fresh cut greenery/refreshing scent is really something special. All of that in a product that costs just slightly more per oz than the Krave Beauty Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser.\n\nI hear so many people rave about this product and it feels so wrong to go against the grain here. But I felt the same way about the Then I Met You cleanser…not for me.\n\nFull Ingredients List: \n\nCamellia Sinensis Leaf Water, Water, Glycerin, Coco-Betaine, Methyl Gluceth-10, Ethoxydiglycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Sodium Chloride, Butoxydiglycol, Diglycerin, Glycereth-26, Xanthan Gum, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Powder, Quillaja Saponaria Bark Extract, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Cannabis Sativa (Hemp) Seed Oil, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Diethoxydiglycol, Coco-Glucoside, Caprylyl Glycol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Decyl Glucoside, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Butylene Glycol, Octanediol, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Citric Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sodium PCA, Disodium EDTA\n\nWhere To Buy (Krave Beauty Site $16.00 USD): [https://kravebeauty.com/collections/shop-all/products/matcha-hemp-hydrating-cleanser](https://kravebeauty.com/collections/shop-all/products/matcha-hemp-hydrating-cleanser)",

    "body": "Hey folks. \n\n\nToday I’m going to review Saponificio Varesino’s Manna Di Sicilia soap. This isn’t a new soap on the market or anything, but there doesn’t appear to be a lot of literature on it around here, so hey, why not contribute! \n\n\n[Here is the album.](https://imgur.com/a/cWXRv)\n\n\nLather: SV Manna Di Sicilia\nBrush: Wolf Whiskers Synthetic\nRazor: Maggard V3\nBlade: Personna Red\nPost: Chatillon Lux Yuzu/Rose/Patchouli\n\n\nThis is the Beta 4.3 version of the soap. Evidently, they started experimenting with this soap at Beta 1.0, so it’s been through a lot of formula revisions if nothing else.  If we’re to believe more revisions = better soap, then it should be a good one.\n\n\nThe soap comes in a 5.3 oz puck in an aluminum tin (this soap is also sold standalone in the usual corrugated box/paper packaging). Soap and aluminum has always been a curious combination to me. Sodium hydroxide reacts violently with aluminum, so you have to be very sure (a) the lye is 100% gone when the soap is placed in the container, and (b) you never have the containers near the area you are soaping. I suppose with large-scale production like SV, that’s no issue, but with artisans it’s a little different. \n\n\nOk, on with it!\n\n\n**Price**\n\n\nI paid $36.95 for this at Maggard. So that puts the per-ounce price at about $7. I’m here in the US, so to be fair, I’m sure some of the cost can be attributed to import fees, overseas shipping, etc. Regardless, that makes this soap cost prohibitive to many, and I can’t fault anyone for that. After shipping, this little container was over $40.  Paying a price like that, I think it’s fair to expect a top-tier performer. \n\n\n**Attributes**\n\n\nI’m very drawn to soap processing and ingredient lists, so I apologize in advance for the long-windedness of this section. \n\n\nEven though SV is a high quality product, I think it’s important to remember that it is definitely not small batch production. The description says “…worked in a plodder, extruded, and cut by hand”. I’ve only read about this kind of stuff, so I'm definitely not an expert, but this seems to indicate that this soap has been through what can generally be described as soap finishing. In the artisan shave soap world, soap finishing doesn’t really exist. In commercially produced soap lines, however, saponification is only the precursor to the finishing steps. In the finishing line, the soap “base” (raw soap) is in the form of chips or noodles. The raw soap is mixed with fragrance, additives, colorants, etc. The plodder-extruder is perhaps the most critical machine in the line in that it forms the soap into a consistent, homogeneous texture with the help of a vacuum chamber. Soap can then be cut and stamped.\n\n\nAs for the ingredients, it’s definitely a complicated formula. I look at a lot of shaving soap labels, and with this one, I had to look up a good handful of ingredients because I’d never heard of them before or didn’t know how they were used. It’s is a vegan soap, and as far as I can tell the “base” consists of coconut oil, stearic acid, and sodium cocoyl isethionate. Sodium cocoyl isethionate is a detergent that’s gained popularity in shaving soap recently. (See B&M’s Reserve soap formulas, for example). Never used it myself, but from what I’ve read it’s mild, lathers well, and isn’t bad for the environment, so it’s got a lot of appeal.\n\n\nThere’s a host of oils that appear to make up the superfat. The way I look at it is that – on labels that list saponified content – oils that DON’T end in -ate must be the superfat. I see about 7 different kinds. \n\n\nPerhaps the most unique ingredient is the fraxinus ornus sap extract (manna ash). This appears to be the namesake of the soap. From what I can glean, the fraxinus ornus is a tree found in Europe. Its sap has historical use in many different applications, but most of them medicinal. According to SV, it’s used in the soap because it is a “highly softening emollient”. So I’m guessing beneficial for post shave properties? Never heard of this one. \n\n\n**Scent** \n\n\nI really, really, really wanted to love this scent. Reading about the fragrance profile and knowing the long history of the company, I knew a lot probably went into the scent development. I love YRP by Chatillon Lux, and the notes are quite similar, so I was certain I would dig this. But I just… don’t really like it. \n\n\nThe official note profile is:\n-Top: Orange, Bergamot, Sage\n-Middle: Rose, Clove, Hydrangea\n-Base: Cedar Wood, Sweet Pathouli\n\n\nI suppose this would be considered a chypre – which in general, I usually like - but what really turned me off was the acidic “punch”. You know how mentholated soaps or aftershaves have a nostril-clearing punch upon first inhale? Sometimes citrus can have a similar impact on my nose. It isn’t always bad, but this one felt extremely bitter to me. Borderline metallic. \n\n\nOff the puck what first hits me is the highly acidic orange. A second or two into the discovery, it’s mostly floral to me. The floral portion of this scent is actually quite pleasant. If I close my eyes and really try hard, I do pick up the sour “feeling” of the patchouli and a woody base. I swear I smell sandalwood every time for a fleeting moment right before I pull my nose away from the puck, but evidently it’s cedar wood.\n\n\nThis isn’t my thing, but the good news is that scent is subjective. So you may love it!\n\n\n**Performance**\n\n\nThe performance of this soap is a redeeming quality, no doubt. I have pretty hard water, so I load every soap of mine for about 40+ seconds by default. Dense clouds of lather were spilling out of the tin at that point. A thick, insulating layer of soap was extremely easy to attain. I say “insulating”, because that’s what the best soaps seem to feel like (at least to me). The lather is so dense that you’re almost able to feel it retain heat against your face. That’s what this was. \n\n\nThe slickness was very impressive, but I do have one caveat here. In the pattern I shave my face, I leave the portion right around my Adam’s apple for last. I do this to make sure the hair in that area can retain as much moisture as possible before it’s shaved, because that area tends to be the most sensitive. I can always tell when a product starts to dry out, because I notice the lather in that area begins to “crack”. That happened with this soap; not in a major way, but noticeable. That’s not a dealbreaker for me, as I notice the same thing in Proraso products and it doesn’t ruin the experience, but it does take away from the slickness and detract from otherwise excellent performance in this case. You never want to feel like you’re in a race against the clock when you’re enjoying a nice shave.\n\n\nThe post shave was absolutely, completely, utterly amazing. Like, probably-the-best-post-shave-I-can-remember, amazing. I couldn’t believe how great my face felt afterwards. When coconut oil is near the top of the list in an ingredients label of a shaving soap, I immediately assume two things: (1) the soap will probably lather well, and (2) I need to watch out for a drying feeling on my face afterwards. Sodium/potassium cocoate is an incredibly effective surfactant, which means it removes oil and grime wonderfully. But that’s not always a good thing – especially in the context of shaving soap - as it can leave your face feeling dry and unnourished. Soapmakers offset this effect by using other oils with more mild properties, building in superfats, adding moisturizing ingredients, and/or using ingredients with some nice unsaponifiable content. Perhaps the reason for the incredibly intricate ingredient list in this formula was to get at a truly superior post-shave/moisturizing product. And if that was the intent, hats off to SV, because this is a fantastic execution of it. I wouldn’t have used or needed a post shave product, but I just didn’t care for the lingering smell of the soap, so I needed to cover it up (also… Yuzu/Rose/Patchouli – ‘nuff said).\n\n\n**Verdict**\n\n\nI’ve got my own funny way of judging how much I’m really in love with a shaving product, because it’s easy to get caught up in the newness of something. I imagine the product being stolen from me, and then ask myself if I would buy it again to replace it. This little mental exercise takes into account the fact that you’ve already spent money on this product… would you do it again just to make yourself whole? It’s a straight up value question. I absolutely would for my L&L and B&M reserve line soaps.\n\n\nIn this case, I think I would, in fact, buy the product again, but it barely crosses the threshold. And I would pull out my wallet while I bit my tongue a little bit. The scent really kills it for me (but again, scent is subjective). HOWEVER, having a soap with such strong post-shave performance really adds an element to my shave den that I want to have at my disposal. The lather itself yields a texture and quality consistent with something you would expect at this price point, in spite of the fact that there are some minor drying issues. The ingredient list is complex, diverse, and unique. \n\n\n*Positives*: triple-milled (lasts a long time), ease of lather, quality and density of lather, slickness, exceptional post-shave performance\n\n*Negatives*: scent (for me), minor drying concerns, price\n\n\nCheers everyone!",

I used it once in the morning and once at night.\n\n\nNow, I have relatively sensitive, yet strange skin. Tea tree oil makes me itch, but I can tolerate retin-a and aha almost daily. Certain lotions and washes make me break out as well. I have extremely mild acne that is influenced a lot by the environment (water especially.) I typically only need a gentle wash containing either SA or BP, some light moisturizer, and some jojoba oil to dislodge any clogged pores and I'm golden. AHA and tea tree oil for spot treatments helps me out as well.\n\n\nI desperately wanted to like this wash. I really enjoyed it for the first month, and it did keep everything on my face relatively neutral. No extreme breakouts or anything. Unfortunately, it didn't do much for any of the closed comedones that the cerave PM moisturizer gave me, or even just regular pimples I had before I started using it.\n\n\nIt also seemed to inhibit the clearing/fading of dark marks. I'm not sure, but it seems to have actually made them worse. I had popped a medium-ish pimple about a month and a half ago, in early july. It was on my cheek and left a decent sized dark mark. I had just gotten this face wash around that time. Now, normally my dark marks fade really quickly, lasting only a week or two at the most. I use AHA on them and that really seems to help. This time around, nothing was helping. It seemed to spread and get bigger too, if you can believe that. Once one portion of it decided to go away, the other part would get bigger. So strange. Anyways, I switched to a different cleanser, and the mark that had started out at less than the size of a watch battery, but that had progressed to 3 or 4 spots about the size of half of a dime each, is finally going away. The wash also made my skin look faintly red in spots, something I had never noticed with any other wash. After I'd wash and dry off, my cheeks, skin to this side of my eyes, forehead, and neck would look flushed in spots. My face didn't feel irritated at all, but I'm so glad I switched, because the redness doesn't happen anymore. It didn't hurt, sting, or itch, and it even went away after about half an hour, but it was a bit unsightly right after I washed my face. \n\n\nI have no idea what was in that cleanser that made my skin behave so strangely, but I'm just issuing a heads-up to this sub.

    "body": " \n\nName: **Ethique Bliss Bar (Cleanser)** \\- a “solid face cleanser for balanced to dry skin”  \n \n\n**Background:**  \nMaybe 6 or so years ago I was having a hard time with acne and became an avid reader of ScA, and one of the main tips I got from this sub was to try a low-ph cleanser. While I know this isn’t important for everyone, this + an adequate moisturizer DRASTICALLY improved my skin’s baseline and ability to heal, and I was an early customer of Stratia and loyalist to my HG Velvet Cleanser by them for years. Stratia has obviously blown up and the prices and shipping have shot up a lot - they also shipped me not one but two cleansers with preservative issues that started rotting on my counter immediately (yuck).\n\nAdditionally, I realized that the bulk of the heavyweight, non-food related waste plastic I consume is for cosmetics and skincare. Ecological crisis anxiety lead me to trying to minimize my packaged products and find bar or zero plastic alternatives that still fit my (slightly snobby) skincare requirements.   \n \n\n**Ingredients:** Creamed Cocos nucifera (coconut) · sodium cocoyl isethionate · cocoyl methyl glucamide · stearic acid · cetyl alcohol · stearyl alcohol · maltodextrin  \n \n\n**PH**: Listed at 5-5.5 (dug in questions on website for this)  \n \n\n**Price**: $17 for full size. Can also purchase $5 mini to try.  \n \n\n**Time in use:** 2-3 months - and my bar is still very substantial! The price is steep for me for one product (I’m frugal) but it’s lasting forever as long as I don’t leave it in the shower.  \n \n\n**Packaging:** Ethique makes plastic-free skincare products so this bar comes in a sort of thick cube wrapped in compostable paper. I was able to acquire it from a local health food store so didn’t have to pay for additional individual shipping (bonus to me on the carbon footprint).  \n \n\n**Experience:** This bar is creamy with a very mild texture to it (NOT a physical exfoliant, just a little more textured than a gel cleanser). It has almost no scent - with no added fragrances, there is a mild nuttiness from the coconut solids. I wet my face and one side of the bar and then rub it directly on my face, though you can also lather it in your hands first. It creates a mild lather and then is easy to rinse off. I find the experience VERY similar to using my old Stratia cleanser - it cleans my skin, but does not create any additional tightness, dryness or itchiness after. I think it’s a medium-light cleanser - I don’t wear foundation or concealer routinely, just fun eye makeup, so it’s enough to take off my SPF and the day’s grime, but I would probably use a wipe or oil to remove heavy makeup first. It takes very little of the product to get a nice cleanse (I always felt like one pump was too much product of gel cleansers!). Ethique makes a little bar holder that you can purchase, but I sewed a little mesh bag that I keep mine in and hang up to dry when not using. I’ve been using it for a few months now and the size of the bar is still significant.  \n \n\n**Overall Opinion:** I love this product - new favorite, would absolutely keep using and re-purchase. It works like my favorite cleansers, is a fun user-experience (I love using the bar instead of a pump of goo!), and doesn’t hurt my skin or break me out. I have found it easy to travel with as well - a lil bar doesn’t take up much room.  \n \n\nMajor **pros**: It’s not fragranced, low ph, feels mild and creamy, lasts forever, is **plastic-free** and “carbon neutral” by the company, is sold in local ‘natural food’ stores so no shipping (for me in the USA), simple + short ingredient list. Possible **cons:** coconut based (though not straight up coconut oil - which I DO have acne sensitivity to. This product does not break me out.), not a heavy-duty cleanser especially for makeup, is a bar - so needs to dry out in between use to not make a mess.   \n \n\n\\~\\*\\~\\* Thanks for reading! I did search this sub before buying for reviews, but found them unsatisfactory! Hope this helps. Also, if anyone knows of an actually usable low-plastic SPF, plz suggest lol! \\*\\~\\*\\~",

I Shampoo/Condition my hair 2-3 times a week and dried with a T-shirt. Everything was going great until a week ago where I noticed my hair didn't feel the same anymore. I don't know how to describe it, but it almost feels rough and in need of conditioner? and my ends feel drier that normal. I am not sure whats happening my first thought was damage since I've been growing it out for almost a year without a trim or a cut. Now i'm starting to think that there is some sort of build up? What do you guys think? I have thick wavy/curly hair. Also, how do you know if your hair is moisturized? I always thought soft silky elastic hair = moisturized which is why I am writing this post because it no longer feels soft and silky, it feels rough.\n\nHeres the Shampoo https://www.makeupalley.com/product/showreview.asp/ItemId=133656/Kirkland-Moisture-Shampoo/Unlisted-Brand/Hair\n\nIngredients: water sodium cocoyl isethionate cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine methyl isethionate disodium cocoyl glutamate sodium lauryl sulfoacetate decyl glecoside ammonium cocoyl isethionate divinyldimethicond/dimethicone copolymer disodium laureth sulfosuccinate helianthus annus (sunflower) seed oil lycium barbarum fruit extract aloe barbadensis leaf extract camellia sinesis leaf extract cucumis sativus (cucumber) fruit extract persea gratissima (avocado) fruit extract punica granatum extract melanin vitis vinifera (grape) seed extract glycol disterate glycerin fragrance quaternium-91 sodium cocoyl glutamate peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate amodimethicone panthenol polyquaternium-10 ppg-3 benzyl ether myristate chlorphenesin methyl gluceth-20 guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride c11-15 pareth-7 laureth-9 phospholipids hydrolyzed vegetable protein pg-propyl silanetriol c12-13 pareth-23 c12-13 pareth-3 trisodium ethylenediamine disuccinate trideceth-12 superoxide dismutase sodium ascorbyl phosphate tocopheryl acetate methylchloroisothiazolinone methylisothiazolinone\n\nAnd the Conditioner: http://www.makeupalley.com/product/showreview.asp/ItemId=133657/KIRKLAND-MOISTURE-CONDITIONER/Unlisted-Brand/Hair\n\nIngredients: water cyclopentasiloxane cetearyl alcohol stearyl alcohol cetrimonium chloride behentrimonium methosulfate helianthus annus (sunflower) seed oil lycium barbarum fruit extract aloe barbadensis leaf extract camellia sinesis leaf extract cucumis sativus (cucumber) fruit extract persea gratissima (avocado) fruit extract punica granatum extract melanin vitis vinifera (grape) seed extract helianthus annus (sunflower) seed extract glycereth-26 dimethiconol divinyldimethicone/dimethicone copolymer fragrance gluconolactone cetrimonium bromide panthenol ppg-3 benzyl ether myristate jojoba esters quaternium-91 amodimethicone hydroxyethylcelloulose cetrimonium methosulfate sodium benzoate c11-15 pareth-7 peg-45m laureth-9 aminomethly propanol glycerin butyrospermum parkii ( shea butter) c12-13 pareth-23 c12-13 pareth-3 cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride (sunscreens) trideceth-12 citric acid ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate sodium ascorbyl phosphate butylene glycol hydrolyed soy protein tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e) hydrolyzed vegatable protein pg-propyl silanetriol\n\nedit: Some more info, My hair is just above shoulder length, when i get in the shower i use a wide tooth comb to get rid of knots then i soak my hair with warm water then lather the shampoo all over scalp and from root to end then rinse then i take a huge blob of Conditioner and use it the same way and leave it in for 1-2 minutes then rinse with cold water.\n\nThanks for the help!",

I've already switched to a SLS, silicone, and paraben free shampoo for the past 7 months or so.\n\nI'm 18, male, and my family doesn't have a history of seborrheic dermatisis (but I inherited \"hives\" from my father's side, so most of my body and sometimes face gets hives once in a while). My scalp doesn't redden anyway so that's probably irrelevant. I haven't experienced anything with my scalp until about April of 2015 where I just started getting white flakes (along with hormonal acne, etc.). It's almost been 2 years and I can't seem to get rid of it permanently. I live in a humid, polluted urban area in Southeast Asia. I've tried shampooing every other day, every two days, but nothing seems to help calm my scalp and remove the flakes. My hair gets oily when I do no-poo because of the environment that I live in.  I've used Head and Shoulders, CLEAR (Asian Brand), and many anti-dandruff shampoos, but it worsened if not did nothing for my itchy scalp. I don't consume meat (pescatarian), and eat a lot of carbs, veggies, fruits and moderate amounts of seafood, if diet has anything to do with my scalp balance. I've tried VCO, ACV, and none of them have helped as well. Nizoral, I did try, it kept my scalp in check for a couple of days, and then it went back to showing visible white flakes. I just used Nizoral to calm the itchiness as we speak. I don't know whether it's dandruff or a dry scalp. Here's a picture of my scalp if any of you could help\n\nThese are the ingredients of the shampoo that I've been using for the past 6 months. aqua (water), sodium cocoyl isethionate (coconut-derived), decyl glucoside (coconut-derived), sodium lactate (sugarcane-derived), sodium gluconate (sugarcane-derived), glycerin (vegetable-derived), Cocos nucifera (virgin coconut) oil, dicaprylyl ether (vegetable-derived), Persea gratissima (avocado) oil, olus (vegetable) oil, Aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf juice, guar gum, levulinic acid (rice or corn-derived), Mentha piperita (peppermint) essential oil, Mentha arvensis (corn mint) essential oil, coco glucoside (coconut-derived) , glyceryl oleate (coconut -derived), xanthan gum, charcoal (bamboo-derived), phytic acid (rice-derived), anisic acid (anise seed-derived), citric acid\n\nThis is my conditioner: aqua (water), cetearyl alcohol (vegetable-derived), cetrimonium chloride (vegetable-derived), Persea gratissima (avocado) oil, olus (vegetable) oil, Helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, Glycine soja (soybean) oil, capryloyl glycerin/sebacic acid copolymer (vegetable-derived), diheptyl succinate (vegetable-derived), Aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf juice, hydroxypropyltrimonium honey, hydrolyzed wheat protein, levulinic acid (rice or corn-derived), fragrance (all-natural), anisic acid (anise seed-derived) (I've tried co-washing once, but it didn't seem to help. I place the conditioner for around 5 minutes long)\n\nThese are local shampoos, under the brand \"Human Nature\"\n\nI would REALLY appreciate anyone's help here. It's embarassing because I have to wear specific light clothing, I've been wearing a cap lately just to prevent flaking from being seen. Should I:\n-buy a natural, imported/from the U.S./Europe shampoos like Rahua?\n-buy a mild (medium level: half synthetic, half natural) shampoo?\n-apply argan oil, or other oils\n-or just go to the dermatologist and get a medicated shampoo?\n\nPlease please help me. I wanna get rid of these flakes for good. \n",

        "body": "No offense bro but you're doing everything wrong. Stop using \"natural\" products, use medicated shampoos instead. You need to use them regularly for them to be effective, and if it's seb derm you have, you will need to use them forever. Sounds to me like it's dandruff/seb derm rather than dry scalp, though I can't see your picture. There is no cure. You said nizoral worked, there's no reason for it to stop working. You're not using it regularly enough.\n\nAlso, reconsider your use of conditioner. You said your scalp does not become red, which leads me to believe that your hair might be short. Coupled with the fact that you are probably of Asian descent, and thus probably have straight and/or fine hair, I would say that you probably don't need conditioner. If conditioner touches your scalp it can make it oily, which makes seb derm worse. If you want to keep using conditioner, apply only to the length of your hair, avoid the scalp.\n\nI hope that helps.",

The product performs perfectly when it is fresh, but after \\~3-4 months it starts degrading. \n\nIt's comprised of three phases:\n\n**Phase 1:** epsom salt (magnesium sulfate), dead sea salt, dendritic salt, and pink himalayan salt. (\\~75% total formula)\n\nThis is combined with a homogeneous liquid mixture of:\n\n**Phase 2:** \n\n* essential oil blend (\\~2.5%)\n* Argan oil (\\~2%)\n* shea butter (\\~1.5%)\n* Lecithin (\\~.4%)\n* Tocopherol (\\~.2%)\n* Menthol (\\~0.08%)\n\nThen the moistened salts are coated with a powder blend of:\n\n**Phase 3:** \n\n* sodium lauryl sulfoacetate (\\~4%)\n* sodium cocoyl isethionate (\\~4%)\n* tapioca starch (\\~3.4%)\n* methylsulfonylmethane (\\~2.8%)\n* beetroot powder (\\~2.4%)\n\nWhen fully combined, it's a powdery salt mixture, with texture almost like kinetic sand. However, as I've conducted stability tests at 45C (113F), I have found that after a few weeks it starts turning tannish colored and **congealing into a paste**. \n\nI'm wondering what is causing these ingredients to meld together. Are there ingredients that are reacting together? Should the pH be adjusted (current formula is \\~6.5)? Should I include a preservative(s)? \n\nAnother important note is I have been packaging this in a sealed bag (airtight), to prevent the essential oils from volatilizing.\n\nAny advice or suggestions is greatly appreciated! I can provide clarification if need be. Thank you in advance! :)",

    "body": "**Long Post Warning**\n\nI am a bit confused as to what is going on with my hair. For context, I recently moved 3 months ago. The water is soft according to the test strip, but the water for this area is labeled as moderately hard. My previous residence was labeled very hard but read as soft with a test strip (city water, not the very hard well water). I am biracial (African-American/Caucasian-mentioned just in case that makes a difference hair-wise) and have a significant enough vision impairment that I tend to go by feel with my hair since I cannot see it well. If anything seems confusing, please feel free to ask me to ellaborate.\n\nBackground is labeled below, as are pictures (apologies for blurriness), if that would be helpful. Most recently, I have thought that my hair was lacking in protein because it feels dry-when-wet, sandpaper-when-dry, is frizz city, barely holds curl if at all; I did a wash with a homemade gelatin mix. That did not improve anything, so I went the high moisture route thinking that might be the issue. The high-moisture right is what I have been doing for the last 2 weeks since I have read that too much moisture can cause some of these symptoms. I have been using Aveeno Almond Oil Blend shampoo/conditioner. This has not seemed to help the problems. Tonight, I tried a protein treatment (HASK: Keratin Protein, used half, let sit for an hour wrapped in shower cap+towel, rinsed). My thinking was that perhaps the professional-grade vs. homemade was the problem with the first protein wash. My hair feels even frizzier than it has been with no difference in texture that I can tell beyond that.\n\n**Background**\n\nMy has always dried super quickly (since I was a child); literally, I can watch the front start to dry before I leave the restroom after my shower. However, despite spending most of my life with dry hair and a dandruff-ridden scalp that was itchy, I finally found a solution last year.\n\nAt that point, I had been using VO5 Elvine Smooth Intense shampoo/conditioner. A few months before that, i was using OGX Refreshing scalp+Teatree mint shampoo/conditioner. Neither seemed to help the problems. The same dry-when-wet, sandpaper-when-dry, frizzy hair. So, I decided to just go all-natural. I found someone on Etsy who made and sold a shampoo bar that was made out of beef tallow. It was a godsend for my hair....it made my hair feel light, soft, manageable, wet-when-wet, moisturized-when-dry, bouncy curls. It did not feel heavy on my hair either. She stopped having time to make the bars to sell, so I bought another tallow bar from someone else. It made my hair feel just the opposite. It never felt clean, too-wet-when-wet, greased rubber-when-dry, curls were present but limp and scraggly.\n\nFound a shampoo bar by 100Senses after that. The ingredients of that bar are below. Most importantly, it did wonders for my hair like that first tallow bar. Now, after moving 3 months ago, this bar is no longer working. It not working seemed to occur from the moment that I moved here, but there could have been something I did not notice previously if it was gradual. My hair is not back to being itchy or dandruff-prone, but it is dry-when-wet, sandpaper-when-dry, barely holds curl and the curl it does seem to hold is limp, a frizzy mess.\n\nI have only used an ACV rinse with all of the bar products. 2 Tbsp ACV with 8 oz water.\n\n100Senses bar ingredients:   A proprietary and moisturizing blend of sodium cocoyl isethionate (derived from coconut oil), stearic acid (from cocoa butter and shea butter), coconut fatty acid, coco glucoside, water/aqua/eau, argania spinosa (argan) kernel oil, panthenol (pro-vitamin b5), camellia sinensis (green tea) leaf extract (antioxidants), sucrose cocoate, aloe vera, glycerin, sodium\n\nI am just kind of at a loss at this point in terms of figuring out what the problem is, so I thought you all might have a better idea with all of the collective experience in this group.\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated.\n\nEdit: No itchy scalp or dandruff. Also, hair does not feel oily; the sheen in the picture is from the lighting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Back](https://preview.redd.it/f05e26oa4mi71.jpg?width=434&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b411d9d9c840134427ea4a9e4fda0cc1ef67d78)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Front Side](https://preview.redd.it/8asc4vrf4mi71.jpg?width=499&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7925536ac40a3404688817d7d61ab06429d58c4a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Front](https://preview.redd.it/ezqfpmwi4mi71.jpg?width=1512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ed63df6212f93abf4e5957a9fd073da45a27323)",

And yes, I tried petroleum jelly, different lotions, creams, moisturizers on my eyelids - none of that worked for me. I still had eyelid eczema. Only avoiding irritating surfactants has worked to let my skin heal\n\nHope this helps!",

Only used the Protopic for a week to reduce the redness and swelling which it did and made my skin look nearly normal. I got rid of all products that I checked to contain Cocomidopropyl Betaine however the eczema/dermatitis has returned. \n\nI’ve now been prescribed all the steroid and Protopic treatments available however I am very reluctant to use them as they just mask the problem when I need to prevent it.\n\nBased on your post the soap I’m using did contain cococate, albeit sodium, not sucrose. (If that matters?)\n\nI’m literally the blandest of guys. Don’t use anything obvious apart from soap. Checked washing detergent and conditioner which all seem to be fine.\n\nI’ve just ordered the Kitsch product and another brand which doesn’t contain any of the above ingredients you’ve listed so hopefully it’ll have a positive effect as there is nothing else I can pinpoint which is causing this.\n\nWhat’s frustrating is this appeared October 2022 from out of nowhere. But I guess there’s no rhyme or reason to these things.",

In that time I haven't had to buy more of it very often because I'd bought it in bulk. Now I'm getting low on my last bottle and go to search where to buy more, and turns out they went out of business a while ago and I hadn't noticed :/\n\nSo I'm looking for a replacement! My hair is:\n\n1.\tShort\n2.\tThin\n3.\tStraight\n4.\tNot very dense\n5.\tI just did the strand of hair in a cup of water test from the wiki, and it sank almost immediately, so I guess that means it's pretty porous\n6.\tPretty oily, so I shampoo every few days (schedule and sweat depending) and will usually cowash with [Kirkland Signature Moisture Conditioner](https://www.costco.com/kirkland-signature-moisture-conditioner-33.8-fl-oz.product.100375352.html) in between\n\nI've used typical grocery store shampoos (Old Spice, Axe, Dove for Men, Head & Shoulders, etc.) in the past and a lot of them have been too harsh, making my hair really frizzy and drying out my scalp, kicking oil production into overdrive, which is something I'd definitely like to avoid. I figure something with similar ingredients, or ingredients that do the same thing would be best, but I have no idea where to look. They are:\n\n>Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Lauryl Glucoside, Glycerin, Cannabis Sativa Seed Oil, Panthenol, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil, Tocopherol, Ascorbic Acid, Ruscus Aculeatus (Butcher’s Broom) Root Extract, Pimenta Dioica (Allspice) Fruit Extract, Pilocarpus Pennatifolius (Jaborandi) Leaf Extract, Silybum Marianum (Milk Thistle) Seed Extract, Sambucus Nigra (Elder) Flower Extract, Chrysanthemum Sinense Flower Extract, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Polysorbate 20, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Glyceryl Undecylenate, Citric Acid, Fragrance (Phthalate free), Caramel\n\nThis list is what I see on my bottle. They must've reformulated at some point before going under because it's different from what's listed in the link.\n\nSo yeah, that's where I'm at right now. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!",

If I’d realised in advance I’d have hoarded it. I’m in Australia and can only find US eBay resellers now. \n\nI loved this cleanser because it made my skin feel clean but not TOO CLEAN and soft, brightened and evened out my skin tone, and never caused redness. I’m looking for a similar replacement, does anybody have any ideas? \n\nHere’s some more info that may help:\n\n- combination skin — nose can be oily, cheeks can be dry \n- I think kaolin may be the ingredient my skin responded so well to, as my skin also really likes Lush’s Angels on Bare Skin (but I don’t want to use that every day). I’ve also generally responded well to salicylic acid and probiotic products.\n- I’m not actually prone to acne, a Sephora assistant recced this because I was trying to deal with a painful recurring pimple. That pimple is still occasionally recurring, I think it may actually be some kind of curse. My skin in general still noticeably improved so I continued using it.\n- My skin is moderately but unpredictably sensitive, I’m generally fine with fragrances and exfoliants but I think that benzyl alcohol specifically might cause redness and stinging. Phenoxyethanol, parabens, essential oils etc seem fine. \n- I prefer a cream, oil or milk cleanser. \n- Willing to spend up to about AU$40 (US$30). \n\nIngredients of this cleanser: *Active Ingredient: Salicylic Acid 2% Acne Aqua (Water, Eau), Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Bentonite, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Kaolin, Charcoal Powder, Chrysanthemum Parthenium Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract, Vanilla Planifolia Fruit Extract, Yogurt Extract, Mel (Honey, Miel), Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Quartz, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Tetrasodium EDTA, EDTA, Phenoxyethanol.*\n\nThanks for your help everybody!",

    "body": "I've been using Formulate shampoo and conditioner for about 10 weeks now and I'd like to share my thoughts with you wonderful people who have taught me so much! I was so curious about these before I bought them, but I couldn’t find many reviews from people who follow CGM or have curly/wavy hair.\n\nAbout my hair: I have type 2 (ranging from a-c in different places on my head), fine, medium porosity, protein loving hair that is a bit longer than shoulder length. It has light bleach damage on the bottom 1/4 of it. \n\nAbout my routine: I live in Phoenix, AZ where it is very hot and very dry most of the time. I have pretty hard water, so I switch between using this shampoo and using a light chelating shampoo (Bb Sunday shampoo). I shampoo then condition and STC upside down. I detangle with a wetbrush and drizzle rinse out the conditioner, then using a TON of water, I scrunch in a defining cream, usually AG Re:coil, then glaze and scrunch in Harry's gel. I pixie diffuse to 80% dry and root clip, then SOTC once 100% dry.\n\nFormulate review: I started with the 8oz. size of both shampoo and conditioner (ingredients listed below).  I set my preferences to be no dyes, no anti-brass, silicone free (all formulate products are sulfate and paraben free). There are options to make them vegan and gluten free, but I did not select those.\n\nThe hair concerns I chose for them to base the ingredients off of were number one curl definition (lol wavy probs) followed by improve scalp health, prevent thinning, volumize and anti-frizz. For scent I chose Tidal for my first round (described as Ocean, Sage, Lily and Musk). \n\nI wasn’t really expecting to be that blown away by these. I've tried function of beauty and really didn't like it. I was considering Prose, and got these instead as a way to talk myself out of spending Prose money and I am SO GLAD I DID. I never knew I could love a shampoo and conditioner, I'm not a brand loyal person and almost never get the same thing twice because I like to experiment, but I will not be straying from these anytime soon. The shampoo is A GAME CHANGER. It has so much slip and is so hydrating I could honestly detangle my hair with just the shampoo in it. It feels so good and lathers well, leaves my scalp feeling actually clean. It has a weird consistency, there's a jelly-like substance mixed into a more traditional shampoo-like substance, but it doesn't really bother me at all when I'm using it. The conditioner is similarly amazing - so much slip, super moisturizing. It gives me such good definition, I mean better than most curl definers, that I started drizzle rinsing, something I’ve never done before, to leave some of it in even though it's not meant to be a leave in. It is shocking how much definition and clumping action it gives my hair!! \n\nLike most CGM users, and because I use my chelating shampoo every fourth wash day or so, I went through the conditioner faster than the shampoo and am now on my second bottle. I've sized up so now my conditioner will be 16oz. and my shampoo will be 8oz. I AM IN LOVE. I switched to a new scent because Tidal smells a bit too much like a man for my personal preference. I set my scent level to medium and I will say it does linger, not overpoweringly, but your hair will smell faintly like it even on day 2. \n\nMy formula does contain a little protein in both the shampoo and conditioner. My hair loves protein, so that's cool with me! Plus I feel it helps balance out the moisture. I suspect it's part of the reason I get such good definition from these. If you are considering trying Formulate, I cannot recommend it highly enough and truly feel it is worth every penny. In the past I've tried TGIN, Jessicurl, DevaCurl (pre-scandal) and As I Am, and nothing compares to Formulate, including products from my pre-CGM days.\nPackaging is really nice, although I wish they would offer the sustainable option to just get refills every month instead of new plastic bottles. I love the ease with which you can make edits to formula and cadence and bottle size. Having access to the formulation chemist and technician so you can talk to them if you have concerns or want changes instead of a call-center type of person is a really nice touch. The website has this awesome feature where it will tell you what every single ingredient is and why it’s there, which is so nice if you’re trying to learn more about hair care ingredients. \nI will say they put a weird amount of emphasis on whether you are a “him or a her” in their hair quiz and that’s just so dumb in my opinion. Hair has no gender, I can’t imagine why they need to know this, and they should have more options than the binary if it’s that important to them. Also it’s really hard even once you have an account to circumvent the stupid quiz and just login. Like way more annoying than it needs to be. These are my only complaints though. \n\n\nTL;DR: Very highly recommend these, worth every penny imo!!\n\nIngredients in my shampoo: Purified Water, Coconut-Derived Cleanser, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Diglycerin, Cocamide MIPA, At Dawn(scent), Methyl Gluceth-20, Guar Gum, Coconut-Derived Cleanser, Polyquaternium-7, Polyglycerol-2 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-6 Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate, Polyglyceryl-4 Cocoate, Polyglyceryl-6 Ricinoleate, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Argan Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Propanediol, Phenylpropanol, Panthenyl Hydroxypropyl Steardimonium Chloride, Sesame Seed Oil, p-Anisic Acid, Levulinic Acid, Vegetable Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Lactic Acid, Sodium Lactate, Carbamide, Starch Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Saw Palmetto, Sweet Almond Oil, Avocado Oil, Vitamin C, Beta-Sitosterol, Hemp Seed Oil, Vitamin E, Citrus Fruit Acid, Pumpkin Seed Oil, Broccoli Seed Oil, Aloe Vera\n\nIngredients in my condiitoner: Purified Water, Polyquaternium-7, Diglycerin, At Dawn(scent), Polyquaternium-32, Lecithin, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Oilseed Turnip, Butyl Stearate, Polyquaternium-37, Mineral Oil, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, Polyglycerol-2 Laurate, Acetamide MEA, Sesame Seed Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Propanediol, Phenylpropanol, Argan Oil, Methyl Gluceth-20, Keratin Oil, Vitamin B5, Sweet Almond Oil, Cocoyl Hydrolyzed Collagen, Avocado Oil, Oleoyl Sarcosine, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenyl Hydroxypropyl Steardimonium Chloride, Coconut-Derived Cleanser, Saw Palmetto, Guar Gum, p-Anisic Acid, Levulinic Acid, Vegetable Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Lactic Acid, Sodium Lactate, Carbamide, Starch Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Vitamin C, Hemp Seed Oil, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitol, Beta-Sitosterol, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Polysorbate 80, Vitamin E, Jojoba Seed Oil, Linoleic Acid, Wheat Germ Oil, Wheat Germ Acid, Cocoyl Sarcosine, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acids, Vitamin E, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Aloe Vera, Broccoli Seed Oil, Pumpkin Seed Oil, Citrus Fruit Acid\n\nEdit: formatting",

I would add at least 3% of cetyl alcohol to help with the hardness.\n\nI made a body wash bar a few weeks and they didn't turn out that hard, they are firm but you can make a dent in it when you push on it. It wasn't until I went to use them and the outer layer was washed away that I could see the SCI needles were still needles. I thought I had melted them all the way. So I am almost certain this is why it failed. I was trying to stir the noodles and the steam from the double boiler was burning me. I might just do it straight on the burner next time because I will be watching it the whole time anyways.\n\nAfter my fail I went and looked at her formulas for body wash bars and shampoo bars and wrote down the percentage of liquid in each one to get an idea of what percentage of liquids will work. I also rarely follow a formula fully and change it, but use a formulas as a guide. They range from 25.8%- 32% and that's with using the powder version of panthenol (DL Panthenol). \n\nThe formula you used is at 32% so that is on the higher end. Plus keep an eye on the Active surfactant matter because some will have more water than others. I have this formula written down in my notebook and thought it was odd that she didn't include a fatty alcohol. Do you know what year she wrote this formula? Because sometimes ones that are older might not be as good as one written more currently because we all get better at formulating as time goes by and learn new things.\n\nI am hoping to make some shampoo and body wash bars soon. I just got some of my orders for BTMS-50 and SCI because so many places are out so I bought what I could find. So if anyone is planning on making a Syndet bar or conditioner bars in the next few months you might want to start shopping for SCI and BTMS-50.",

It has worked best if I deliberately keep it on heat for a bit to evaporate off more water, but they still take months to harden. Though in such high humidity as you have, I don't know if more time to dry will help much. I think that one difference might be something to do with her putting the bars into a deep freezer that helps remove moisture. I don't have a deep freezer.\n\nI now cut way down on the liquids. Getting rid of the panthenol and liquid protein helped. The sodium lactate made no difference either way. Reducing the liquid surfactant to less than 15% helps, I think the last one I did had 8% CAPB. I use Phenonip. I use about 10% more powdered surfactant (SLSa or AOS 90 or Sodium something Taurate). I have tried adding either clay and starch for bulk, as used by Humblebee, which doesn't make the foam less good, and seems to help.\n\nAdding a bit more fatty alcohol, especially cetearyl or stearyl or behenyl, and/or a few percent stearic acid, does help with hardness. At under 10% it doesn't seem to suppress the foam enough to notice much.\n\nAfter some years and at least 10 versions, I still don't make very good shampoo bars. Nothing wrong with shampoo paste! It still works! Jar of paste is valid cleanser!",

You are correct that it can suppress foam production, but when your surfactants are above 20% of your product, if shouldn't be a problem.\n\n Cocoamidopropyl betaine will boost foaming so I'm glad to see that here. The water content in CAPB solution is quite high (~70%) so that's likely why you're getting a doughier consistency if drying isn't complete. \n\nThe humidity is likely the cause for concern. You may need months (like with soap) to fully harden and get what you want. You can try drying them out in a slow oven (like CPOP soap) or better yet a dehydrator to see if it can speed up the process artificially.",

It helped a bit but doesn't seem much different to my old shampoo which contained Sodium C14-16 olefin sulfonate which I learned is just as harsh as a sulfate. \n\nMy full routine is:\n\nWash days:\n\nWash once a week with a sulfate free shampoo bar and condition for 2 minutes. I just gently glaze it over and scrunch it in. Applying more to the ends. \n\nMicro plop so hair is damp and apply a 5-10p sized amount of Giovanni weightless leave in conditioner with praying hands, scrunching it in. \n\nMicro plop some more and fine tune fly aways and enhance definition with fingers a bit. \n\nThen either leave to air dry or diffuse on cold air setting until 90 percent dry and leave to air dry.\n\nRefresh days: \n\nTwo different methods: \n\n1. Spray water in my hands, gently smooth over hair to flatten down frizz and scrunch. Repeat process until hair is damp. I usually do one side at a time and then the back and top. \n\n2. Spritz hair all over a few times with a water mister and scrunch. Micro plop with T-shirt and leave to air dry. \n\nMaintenance: \n\nI have hard water so every few weeks I will do a Malibu C treatment. \n\nClarify every month with a sulfate shampoo and condition as usual. Maybe a little longer if hair is especially dry. \n\nFirst 3 pics are on wash day and the following 3 days later after refresh. \n\nPlease, if you need more info, including more pictures - just let me know! \n\nAny help is very much appreciated, many thanks !",

Tallow and butters like Kokum, Mango seed have the most stearic acid, however straight stearic acid (which is 99% of the time actually a 50/50 mix of stearic and palmitic acid) has tons of benefits in immediately raising the Stearic/palmitic numbers and allowing for soapers to add other beneficial ingredients (like shea and other exotic fats) without sacrificing the qualities we value . Coconut oil (cocos nucifera) is ubiquitous for its bubble formation, it doesn't take a bunch, especially for shave soap. Too much and it can be drying or stripping on your skin which is why it's always further down from anything containing stearic acid.\n\nI'd say you're probably allergic or sensitive to a fragrance, maybe all of them.\n\n  \nI'm surprised sodium cocoate is the number 1 ingredient in SV, a famously excellent soap.

I heard somewhere in passing that stearic acid and thick butters (or beeswax) helps give form and shape to the whipped soap. Can some one help me with what ingredients to look for in this regard? I am thinking of buying this foam base. Or if u suggest, i could get the individual ingredients seperately and mix too. I plan to send it to my extended family for Christmas so i would love if it could hold its shape in transit and in their hot n humid shower caddy 😅. I would also like to add flower infused oils (hibiscus for red and moringa for green) to the recipie. \n#2 question: can I add my oils and still maintain the shape of the whip? #3 question: should I add more preservatives since I wish to add oils and other ingredients to the base?\n\nFormula\n1.

It's not a problem as far as CG, but is sometimes avoided by people trying to go 100% \"natural.\" Salicylic acid is very commonly used to treat acne—it's an exfoliant, helping to shed dead skin cells and avoid clogged pores—so it's not surprising that it would be found in a scalp relief product. It *may* have a drying effect if you use it quite often though. \n\nThe other stuff like C14 16 Olefin Sulfonate, Sodium Coco Sulfate (basically a less-processed version of SLS), and dimethicone are not CG.\n\nHave you tried co-washing with your tea tree conditioner? I use Trader Joe's Tea Tree Tingle and it's the best co-wash I've ever tried; I suspect tea tree makes the difference.",

It is color treated (because I have some greys) and I rarely use heat to style. The one upside it that is tends to be very soft (except when I pick the wrong product and dry it out). \n\nI am getting so turned around and confused with all the hair care advice I read. I am currently using [HairStory](https://www.hairstory.com/products/new-wash/) and it is going alright, but that s\\*&t is expensive. I made the mistake of using a leave-in that came in an Ipsy bag ( [FoxyBae Magic Daily Leave In Hair Mask - 12-in-1](https://www.foxybae.com/products/12-in-1-magic-daily-leave-in-hair-mask)). It was good the first time I used it but now my hair is feeling a bit grubby (so I guess I need to use a clarifying shampoo). I like to wash my hair ever other day, but on day two I always have to wear it in a ponytail. I'm tired of fighting it every day and spending a fortune on stuff that never seems to work. \n\nI have tried CG method, untold products for decades, products for curly hair, products for wavy hair, products for fine hair...). If I don't wash my hair frequently my scalp itches, so I have never managed more than three days. It takes my hair a long time to air dry, so I hate washing it because I have to go to work with wet hair or sleep with wet hair. \n\nI just want my hair to be moisture/protein balanced and not weighed down. I don't like complicated hair routines and prefer to use little or no product outside of shampoo and conditioner. I occasionally use [L'anza Bounce Up Spray](https://www.ulta.com/healing-oil-bounce-up-spray?productId=xlsImpprod18041073) and that seems to be magic. I have [Olaplex](https://olaplex.com/) 3 and it worked great the first time and has had diminishing returns since. I also have Olaplex 6 and it feels heavy in my hair. \n\nI tried that hair in water test and it never sunk despite leaving it in the cup for over an hour; however, I hear that this test may not be that helpful. Again, I get conflicting information. \n\nI am currently eyeing the [Verb Ghost line](https://www.verbproducts.com/products/smooth-shine-duo?variant=32294608240729). Ingredients below.

The Ghost hair mask is very light, so if you felt weighed down by others, definitely try that one. I use the oil sparingly at night any time my ends feel dry and I always wake up to super soft hair. I bought one of those [shampoo brush things](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074ZDXFL6?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share) for a scalp massage while shampooing and that feels nice and I think my roots are less greasy for longer.

While this cleaned most of my hair, the part that had been bleached for the color was always sticky, and the ends of my hair were floofy.

What are these compounds, and why are they better than sulfates? \n\nI also find that 2nd day hair is far too greasy to go out in public with when I use these shampoos. I blow dry my hair regularly because I don't have time to let it air-dry in the mornings, and if I go outside it'll freeze.\n\nI think the best texture my hair has ever had was when coloring it all over with Manic Panic, then blow-drying it. My hair is always voluminous and bouncy when I do this, but then I have to wash the dye out to avoid staining everything. Is there a way to achieve this texture without the dye? Is that feasible on a regular basis?\n\nI typically try to wear my hair layered and messy, but my hair is so straight that layers disappear, and it has a hard time staying messy.\n\nI'm looking for an all-over routine, preferably with products I can order from Amazon Prime.",

    "body": "Hello\n\nI have been growing my hair out for almost 1 year. I used a shampoo that contained sulphates and used no conditioner :$. But recently i switched to a sulphate free shampoo and conditioner from petal fresh (Ingredients below). I used your ingredient checker to see if these products were okay and they were :).\n\nBut now i got this problem that after i wash my hair and use the conditioner my hair kinda feels waxy and heavy (for some reason its mostly at the back of the head) + my ends of my hair kinda feel brittle. Like there's something in it but i pay attention that i rinse everything out. But when i wash my hair it kinda sticks together and is difficult to rinse everything out but i really pay attention to it. I don't know why this is happening but it is really bothering me. \n\nCould this be that i am using conditioner now and never used it before? Or that i am using sulphate free shampoo which makes something build up in my hair? Because when i just used shampoo with sulphates i didn't had this problem. Or is this the way the hair should feel when using no sulphates and conditioner? Because i noticed that my hair is more wavier now then it was when i used sulphate shampoo and no conditioner? Or is it hard water build up? Because i have moderatly hard water.\n\nMy hair is not really curly (more wavy actually) but i didn't know where to post this question and i have been reading this reddit for the past few days and i am really impressed by the knowledge of this subreddit. And you also use this sulphate / silicon free approach to get healthy looking hair. :) But if this is not the right sub to ask this could you please redirect me?

This [study](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms15058293) suggests that it has anti-pigmentmentation impact at 1% extract, but doesn't mention the vehicle (the study also has some interesting citations for ashwagandha's immuno-suppressant and anti inflammatory properties in vitro/in mouse studies). This [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29142430) suggests a significant difference in delivery of the active component depending on how the ashwagandha is delivered.\n\nIf you are interested in ashwagandha for its supposed hormone balancing properties, you may want to try a sulfur wash, which can be helpful for hormonal acne.\n\nI personally find clay, even in a cleanser, to be too much for my skin when it is sensitive. It acts a physical exfoliant, which is usually not what my skin needs to when it is sensitive. But you should definitely experiment with what works best for your skin!\n\nIf you are looking for ingredients that are calming and good for acneic skin, there are others that are well researched! Calendula is great, which you have in your formula. Centella and Licorice root are some of my favorites. Very calming, and extracts are available on Lotioncrafters/Making Cosmetics. You might also want to look at White Willow Bark Extract.\n\nI personally like to keep my cleansers very basic, and keep any actives for toners/serums.\n\nIf this is your first formulation, check our Swift Craft Monkey's guides!

Do the sulfates in shampoo typically cancel out the silicones in it, or should I look for a shampoo without silicones?\n\nFor reference, the shampoo currently in my bathroom contains Dimethicone and Amodimethicone as well as Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate and Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate (and a bunch of other stuff).

        "body": "For a shampoo thickener, Crothix is usually fairly common. Don't know how you feel about the ingredient, but it does really well at 1-2 wt%. Alternatively, sulfonates can be thickened with salt (either monovalent NaCl or divalent MgCl2). Usually somewhere around 2-4 wt% is the transition point to networked worm-like micelle gels.\n\nGetting that much SCI to dissolve can be difficult. Definitely pre-dissolve SCI in CAPB first. It isn't an easy substance to work with, for sure and can contribute to an opaque product when cooked to room temp (around 20 °C or so).\n\nYour conditioner doesn't have an emulsifier fit for this system. Glyceryl stearate can be a great secondary emulsifier, but it is best used when paired with something that forms normal micelles like PEG-100 glyceryl stearate to bring the emulsion back into a place where it can be kinetically stabilized. Using both together helps promote lamellar networks that contribute to better emulsion stability. \n\nMany try BTMS or BTMCl because it provides thickening and conditioning. I'd use polyquaternium-10 and polyquaternium-7 in your conditioner, but save the polyquaternium-7 for your shampoo. Quaternized HEC tends not to play well with strong anionics (like sulfonates, which is what SCI is).\n\nI'm not sure the reasoning for avoiding sulfates, but sulfonates are basically the same, so if you worry about stripping, these both can be formulated to be gentler. \n\nChatGPT sucks and usually doesn't give good answers. I would try and learn more about how these ingredients work before making a complicated emulsion like a conditioner or shampoo. \n\nTry making a simple 3-5 ingredient hand wash that uses salt to thicken to get a feel for thickening, and test out a simple emulsion (like a 4 ingredient lotion) before wasting too much on expensive polyquats.\n\nAlso pH will matter a lot! Make sure you're pHing your product at the end appropriately. 0.25 wt% citric acid might not be enough to bring the pH down to the proper place. Always leave extra room for pHing and make up the difference in water.",

    "body": "Hey, SCA! I posted this in the Daily Questions thread yesterday, but hope I'll get more visibility this way. \n\nIs/was anyone else a fan of the [Skinfix foaming oil cleanser from before their brand overhaul and move to Sephora](https://www.influenster.com/reviews/skinfix-foaming-oil-cleanser-34oz)? This is my absolute favorite second cleanser — I love the super-creamy, rich, dense foam and the barely-there scent, and it leaves my skin feeling so clean but never dry or tight. (I have very dehydrated, combination skin.) But with Skinfix's brand overhaul a year or two ago, it seems they've not only updated the packaging, but [reformulated it as well](https://www.sephora.com/product/barrier-foaming-oil-cleanser-P442836). I've been subsisting on a panic-driven eBay haul of the original version ever since but will soon be down to my last bottle. Sad.\n\nHere are their relative ingredients lists (looks like they mainly took out most of the fruit extracts, which might not be so bad?):\n\n**Original:** Water/Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Jojoba Oil/Macadamia Seed Oil Esters, Squalene, Panthenol, Betaine, Phytosteryl Macadamiate, Phytosterols, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Hydrolyzed Chondrus Crispus Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Rose Extract, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Extract, Jasminum Officinale (Jasmine) Flower/Leaf Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Extract, Rubus Ideaus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract, Cucumis Melo (Melon) Fruit Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Cananga Odorata Flower Extract, Hydroxypropyl Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Benzoic Acid, Phenoxyethanol.\n\n**New (Barrier+) version:** Water/Eau/Aqua, Glycerin, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Glycol Distearate, Betaine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Gluconolactone, Jojoba Oil/Macadamia Seed Oil Esters, Squalene, Phytosteryl Macadamiate, Phytosterols, Tocopherol, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Hydroxypropyl Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propanediol, Xanthan Gum, Coconut Acid, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Chloride, Benzoic Acid, Sodium Benzoate.\n\nHas anyone used both versions — or just the new one — and are you willing to share your thoughts? I'll probably end up purchasing the new version anyway, just to try it, but I'd love to have some insight beforehand, if possible! \n(I'd also appreciate any recs for similar cleansers from folks who've used the old one before!)",

However longer alkyl chains give better foam stability ([source using SLS as an example](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927775722021495)).\n\nThe coconut oil-derived surfactants have a mixture of C8-C10, while the lauryl group (C12) has a longer chain length and will have a more stable foam. \n\nBetween SLI and SLEI, the ethoxylated portion reduces foaming ability ever so slightly because it the ethoxylated groups lead to a slightly higher surface tension compared to non-ethixylated versions. This is probably because of how the ethoxylated groups affect packing at the air-water interface. \n\nSo SLI will have the best foam stability. You can also use enhancers of foaming that reduce surface tension while still be gentle (like CAPB) creating mixed micelles. Not all surfactants do this well, so play around and see what you like. \n\nI do think a few percent SLI in a shampoo does a lot for foaming while still leaving a alkylglucosides formula rather mild. I usually don't use more than 10 wt% in a AG-derived formula.",

All the products I use and review here are completely fragrance free, contain no masking fragrance, no “natural” fragrances or essential oils, no photo-sensitizing plant oil/extracts (lavender, eucalyptus, citrus, etc ). So here we go: \n\n**BEST**: \n\n1. **Acne.org cleanser**: this is my HG face cleanser that I have repurchased so many times. No matter how many products I try over the years, I always come back to this because it’s cost effective, works well without drying out my skin, and does not leave a residue behind. It has a gel texture and come in a pump bottle which make it super convenient to use. \n\n**Ingredients:** Water, PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, PEG-150 Distearate, Sodium Laureth 13 Carboxylate, Disodium Cocamphodiacetate, Butylene Glycol, Sage Extract, Cucumber Extract, White Oak Bark Extract, Panthenol, Allantoin, Acrylates Copolymer, Methylgluceth-20, Polysorbate-20, Quaternium-15, DMDM Hydantoin, Disodium EDTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. **First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Face Cleanser:** This cleanser is one of my recent discovery and I like it a lot. It’s a little more pricey than the [Acne.org](http://acne.org/) cleanser, but it works well and is gentle on the skin. It comes in a tube which makes it convenient for travel. \n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua/Water/Eau, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Hydrogenated Coconut Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Stearyl Alcohol, Allantoin,  Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Tocopherol, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides Citrate, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Sodium PCA, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Sodium Chloride, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Maltodextrin,  Tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. **Soon Jung pH 5.5 Foam Cleanser:** This is a Korean product. It comes in a tube and does cleanse well, doesn’t over dry, and leaves no residue behind. Overall, this is a good cleanser. If you are looking for a good Korean water based cleanser, I would recommend this one. This would be best for people with normal to oily skin, IMO.\n\n**Ingredients:** Water / Aqua / Eau, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Coco -betaine, Potassium Benzoate, Sodium Chloride, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Disodium EDTA, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Madecassoside\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WORST**: \n\n1. **Hada Labo Goku-jyun Foaming Face Wash:** This is probably the worse cleanser out of everything I tried in a long time. I decided to purchase this product to try because I like the oil cleanser from Hada Labo, but this one is a total let down! This cleanser come in a pump bottle, which makes it easy to dispense the product, but that’s the only pro. Now the cons: This foam cleanser does not cleanse well. For me, It’s too gentle on the skin, leave a greasy residue on my skin and made me break out. I believe the greasy feeling is due to the Vaseline in the formula. I think this cleanser will only work for people with dry to very dry skin, but even if you have dry skin, there are so many other better cleansers out there. Those of you with oily, acne-prone or combo skin, this product will be a disaster! So stay away!\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, BG, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate, PEG-8, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamide DEA, PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Sodium Taurine Cocoyl Methyltaurate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate(Super Hyaluronic Acid), Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate(Skin-adsorbed Hyaluronic Acid), **Vaseline**, Citric Acid, Polyquaternium-7, EDTA-2Na, BHT, Methylparaben\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SO-SO:**\n\n1. **Rovectin Skin Essentials Conditioning Cleanser:** This is another Korean product. It comes in a pump bottle and is very convenient to use. However, this is a very average cleanser. It’s not the worst, but not the best either. It works and is gentle on the skin, but there’s nothing wow worthy about it. Also, there’s nothing it does that the other cleansers I mention above cannot do. I won’t be repurchasing this one. \n\n**Ingredients:**  Water, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Decyl Glucoside, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Centella Asiatica (Gotu Kola) Extract, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Glycine, 1,2-Hexanediol, Serine, Glutamic Acid, Aspartic Acid, Protease, Leucine, Alanine, Lysine, Arginine, Tyrosine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Proline, Valine, Isoleucine, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Histidine, Cysteine, Methionine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Potassium Benzoate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Trioleate",

For drier and dehydrated skin that isn't acne prone, you could use this as a single cleanse. I have all winter. \n\n* **Clinique Take The Day Off Balm** - I got this as a sample pot and it's really cosmetically elegant. Lathers up beautifully. Very satisfying to use. Single cleanse works for me. \n\n* **Beauty of Joseon Radiance cleansing balm** - this is so fancy! Unlike the Clinique, it turns straight to an oil texture when you rub it in. I prefer that the Clinique is a slightly thicker texture when you rub it in personally but I'm trying a fermented skincare routine which is why I bought it. The packaging is amazing - it comes with a spatula in a little compartment in the lid! I'm not sure it emulsifies as well as the Clinique so I double cleanse my T-zone to be safe. \n\n* **Simple Refreshing Gel face wash** - very nice, good second cleanser. Cheap but effective. Also Fungal Acne safe according Folliculitis Scout but please check yourself. I use this as my second cleanser on my T-zone and my sole cleanser on my neck/upper chest.",

    "body": "Alright, this was both a very easy and very hard review to put together as my views on this Water Based Cleanser are probably a little biased LOL! You see…this Cleanser saved my life…\n\nLOL, not that dramatic but pretty close. If you remember (or don’t) I decided about a month ago that it would be an excellent idea to use an “all-natural” Bar Soap that had been listed as okay for use on the face. WRONG LOL…over the two plus weeks I used it I ended up stripping my Skin, clogging my pores, inviting breakouts, and generally messing everything up.\n\nWell, after that experience I really needed to switch to something that was going to reverse what I had done to myself. This Make P:rem Cleansing Foam jumped out since it has been recommended by a few bloggers as being great for Sensitive Skin. \n\nThe first thing that I surprised me about this Product was just how creamy/foamy it truly is. Most pH Balanced Cleansers do a decent job (at best) of foaming up…but this one feels really thick and luxurious. Especially after mixing it in my Nooni Whip Maker…WOW! The closest pH Balanced Cleanser I can compare it to is the Sulwhasoo EX Brightening Cleansing Foam. \n\nAs for the Formula…there are a couple of Ingredients that do raise some concern. The Coconut Based Surfactants (not an issue) followed by a few Essential Oils (can be an issue). I didn’t have a problem with them but I would hesitate from recommending this as the ultimate gentle Cleanser as Essential Oils pose a problem for some. Bergamot Oil and Sage Oil are both here. In addition to the Oils we also have Raspberry Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, and Citric Acid (which I assume is there to help lower the pH). \n\nEssential Oils aside…this Cleanser brought my Skin back from the brink so fast I was truly shocked. The foam feels so comfortable and luxurious…and the mild herbal scent was relaxing. Just after a few uses my Skin seemed to be less red and the few angry red bumps I had developed were much more calm.\n\nOver the past few weeks I have fallen in love with this Product LOL! Usually I am not a fan of such a “basic” Cleanser. Give me some antioxidants, give me some brightening…something! But, this Make P:rem Safe Me Cleanser was exactly what I needed in the moment. I came in and quietly said “I’m just gonna pop in here and fix this.” and went on its way.\n\nMy struggle with wholeheartedly recommending this Product (aside from the plastic bottle) is that I think my view is a victim of circumstance. If my Skin was happy and healthy at the time I brought this into my Routine I could totally see myself as calling it boring, basic, or not doing that much. And again, those Essential Oils would keep from saying its the new go-to for Sensitive Skin peeps.\n\nPersonally, I plan to keep the rest of this bottle as my “In Case Of Emergency…Use This” Cleanser. For those that aren’t particularly triggered by Essential Oils (LOL)…this is an excellent go to for days when your Skin is feeling overworked or (in my case) you made a bad call with another Product. I feel like I would even put this one above my other favorites from Peach & Lily and Youth To The People (for the purpose of bringing Skin back to a happy state) as its creamy consistency adds a bit of comfort/luxury that Gel Style Cleansers have a hard time matching.\n\nFull Ingredients List: \n\nWater, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Coco-Betaine, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Potassium Benzoate, Sodium Chloride, Polyquaternium-67, Potassium Cocoate, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Oil, Sodium Acetate, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eqlgae0atjo41.jpg?width=1240&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea705dc9de5e8a1293e4b9371c2ced4d8c677813",

Normally I don't use physical exfoliants but sometimes I just want a little something other than my chemical ones, and this seems gentle, leaving my skin softer but not feeling abraided or damaged.\n\nGiven TJ's seems to sometimes create these duplicate products for expensive skincare I can only hope they'll release this in a big bottle someday. In the meantime I'd like to know what other products are out there that are similar. I haven't tried a rice powder exfolient before but I would like one with a similar feel. I think this might be a dupe for Dermalogica's microfoliant. Are there any other products that have a similar feel or might perform similarly?

    "body": "Assembling the final array of baby supplies in the last few weeks before my due date and wondering... do I need to be purchasing infant-specific cleansers and moisturizers? I have through trial and error identified a few skincare products which don't irritate my own sensitive skin. My suspicion is that baby hygiene products are just marketing, but please do let me know. I've included ingredient lists for what we already own. Are there any ingredients in particular that ought to be avoided for newborns? The cleanser is fragranced and the moisturizer does include a variety of extracts and oils, but otherwise both are quite mild.\n\nKirk's 3 in 1 Nourishing Cleanser:\n\nWater, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Natural Fragrance, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Benzyl Alcohol, Benzoic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride\n\nHempz Sensitive Skin Herbal Body Moisturizer:\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Isopropyl Palmitate, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Stearic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Sorbitan Stearate, Triethylhexyl Citrate, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Flour, Cetyl Alcohol, Cannabis Sativa Seed Oil, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Oil, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Vanilla Planifolia Fruit Extract, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate, Mauritia Flexuosa Fruit Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Dipteryx Odorata Seed Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Polysorbate 40, Aminomethyl Propanol, Nylon-12, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium EDTA, Coumarin, Ascorbic Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Tocopherol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate\n\nI'd also love sunscreen recommendations. Have noticed what's marketed for babies tends to have only mineral/physical active ingredients whereas I've personally always gravitated toward higher SPF \"chemical\" sunscreens for efficacy.",

    "body": "# Recommended Product Ingredients\n\n​I always have clients review their hair care routine with me during appointments, which helps me recommend better products for their needs. The most common issue people share is experiencing a loss of effectiveness in their products over time. This results from a need to balance cleaning your hair with moisturizing it. Below I've provided a guide to help balance your hair care routine based on the recommendations I usually give my clients, complete with a list of the most effective ingredients for each category. I purposely left non-detergents (soaps) off of the list because they use oils to remove contaminants, which I've found does not clean hair as well.  (This is the full blog but if you want to screenshot the ingredient lists the post is a bit better organized on my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-recommended-product-ingredients.html))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Surfactant Cleanser **Definition:** Surfactant cleansers are detergents or cleaning agents. They work by surrounding and lifting residue off of the hair strand so water can rinse it away. On a product's ingredient list you generally see them listed towards the top. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Detoxes, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used by all hair types. Helpful for oily hair. See [How Often Should I Shampoo?](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html) ​for frequency.\\*\\*Ingredients:\\*\\*​\n\n* Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n* Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n* Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n* Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n* Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n* Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n* Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n* Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate \n* Ammonium lauryl sulfate ​\n* Ammonium laureth sulfate\n* Sodium polystyrene sulfonate\n* Cocamidopropyl betaine\n* Coco betaine\n* Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine\n* Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n* Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n* Sodium lauroamphoacetate\n* Sodium sulfosuccinate\n* Cocamidopropyl betaine\n* Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n* Sodium lauryl sulfate \\*\n\n*\\* Sodium lauryl sulfate is not recommended for daily use.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Non Surfactant Cleanser **Definition:** This cleaning agent does not completely lift oil and grease off of the hair strand, meaning it does not fully remove them. Doing so lightly cleanses your hair while also retaining moisture (i.e. conditioning it). It is not recommended for use with silicones, mineral oil or petroleum products because these ingredients deposit a [residue](https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/493588) under the hair's cuticle that require a surfactant cleanser to remove. I usually suggest using a clarifying shampoo once a month with this type of cleanser. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Detoxes, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used by all hair types. Helpful for dry hair. See [How Often Should I Shampoo?](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html) ​for frequency.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil\n* Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil\n* Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil\n* Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil\n* Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Detox **Definition:** While similar to the Cleanser category, the Detox category is stronger. These cleansing agents remove product build up and help with demineralization of the hair. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used once a month by all hair types. Helpful for oily hair.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Disodium EDTA (Ethylamine Diamine Tetraacetic Acid)\n* Pentasoidum Pentetate\n* Sodium phytate\n* Phytic acid\n* Citric acid (needs large enough quantity to be effective)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Humectants **Definition:** T​his ingredient helps retain moisture from water by attracting it to the hair strand in humid climate conditions. However, in dry weather humectants have the opposite effect and will transfer moisture from your hair into the atmosphere. This can leave your hair dehydrated, which may not be what you want depending on its current state.*Tip: Humectants are complementary to silicones and plant oils.* **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** Can be used daily by all hair types. Helpful for dry hair. Using a detox once a month is recommended with this category.\\*\\*Ingredients:\\*\\**Hydrolyzed Proteins*\n\n* Hydrolyzed Elastin, silk, keratin, collagen \n* Peptides (wheat, oat, soy...)\n* Amino acids (wheat, oat, soy) or glycine, alanine, proline, etc.\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (source of protein, i.e. keratin, silk, rice, soy)\n* Cocoyl hydrolyzed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (source of protein)\n* Potassium cocoyl hydrolyzed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (source of protein)\n* Hydrolyzed oat flour\n\n*For Use In Humid Weather​*\n\n* Vegetable glycerin\n* ​Sorbitol\n\n*Plant Gels*\n\n* Panthenol\n* Flax Seed Gel\n* Okra Gel\n* Aloe Vera\n* Hydroxyethylcellulose\n* Pectin\n* Xanthan Gum\n* Guar Gum\n* Marshmallow Root\n* Slippery Elm​\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Soluble Silicones **Definition:** This ingredient coats the hair shaft to lock in moisture, reduce frizz, add slip, and give hair the coveted soft and silky feel. Soluble silicones can be washed out with non surfactant cleansers. **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** Can be used daily by all hair types. Using a detox once a month is recommended with this category. \n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Any silicone with PEG as a prefix\n* Bis-peg/ppg-16/16 peg/ppg-16/16 (This is an emulsifier - not for shine or lubrication)\n* Cyclomethicone\n* Dimethicone copolyol\n* DEA PG-Propyl PEG/PPG-18/21 Dimethicone\n* Dimethicone PEG-8 Phosphate\n* Dimethicone-PG Diethylmonium Chloride\n* Hydrolyzed Silk PG-Propyl Methylsilanediol Crosspolymer\n* Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n* Hydrolyzed Wheat protein/hydroxypropyl polysiloxane and cystine/silicone co-polymers\n* Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Silanetriol\n* Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol\n* Lauryl methicone copolyol\n* PEG-40/PPG-8 Methylaminopropyl/Hydropropyl Dimethicone Copolymer\n* PEG/PPG-14/4 Dimethicone\n* PEG/PPG-20/15 Dimethicone\n* PEG-12 Dimethicone\n* PEG/PPG-20/15 Dimethicone\n* PPG-8 Methylaminopropyl, Hydroxypropyl Dimethicone Copolymer\n* PEG-7 Amodimethicone\n* PEG-8 Disteramonium Chloride PG-Dimethicone\n* PEG-33 (and) PEG-8 Dimethicone (and) PEG-14\n* Silanetriol\n* Silicone Quaternium-8\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Plant Oils **Definition:** This ingredient is used to retain moisture, condition hair, protect from damage and minimize dryness. **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** Can be used daily by all hair types. Helpful for dry hair.  **Ingredients:**\n\n* Coconut (Cocos Nucifera) Oil \n* Sunflower (Helianthus Annuus) Seed Oil\n* Olive (Olea Europaea) Oil\n* Argan (Argania Spinosa) Oil\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Preservatives **Definition:** Additives that prevent spoilage. Most consumer products contain preservatives because without them any water-based solution will eventually grow mold or bacteria. **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** A routine is not applicable for this category since it's included in most products, but pay attention to whether your products cause scalp irritation. That could be a sign to switch to, or alternate with, preservative free options.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Sodium Benzoate\n* Potassium Sorbate \n* Benzoic acid\n* Dehydroacetic acid\n\n*​Sources:* [*Cationic Compounds in Cosmetics*](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/search?q=surfactants)*, Science-y Hair Blog*[*Detergents Which Remove: Silicone*](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2016/05/detergents-which-remove-silicones.html)*, Science-y Hair Blog​*[*Essentials of Hair Care Often Neglected: Hair Cleansing*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3002407/)*, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)*[*Glycerin and Humidity*](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2015/02/glycerin-and-humidity.html)*, Science-y Hair Blog*[*Film Forming Humectants - What They Are And Why You Need Them*](http://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2014/07/film-forming-humectants-what-they-are.html)*, Science-y Hair Blog*",

I'm used to my Amore ($90) one being an excellent exfoliator, but I wasn't expecting this one to also exfoliate as well as remove my makeup. Added bonus! I'm definitely picking up another one as this one is less than half of the price of my Amore, lasts longer and acts as a cleanser as well. SOLD.",

Because of the ingredients list and an email from Acure's customer service, this is fairly long... **TLDR** great pH balanced, affordable cleanser with a number of natural oils and plant-based ingredients. \n\n**Ingredients:** Organic Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower, Organic Curoxidant Superfruit Blend [Organic Euterpe Oleracea (Acai) Berry, Organic Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry), Organic Rosa Canina (Rosehips), Organic Punica Granatum (Pomegranate), Fair Trade Organic Aspalanthus Linearis (Rooibos)], Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate (from Coconut), Glyceryl Stearate SE (Vegetable), Organic Virgin (Cocos Nucifera) Coconut Oil, Stearyl Dihydroxypropyldimomium Oligosaccharides (from Sugar), Vegetable Glycerin, Glyceryl Oleate (Fatty acid), Decyl Glucoside (Sugar Soap), Disodium Cocoglucoside Citrate (from Coconut), Phenethyl Alcohol (Fatty Alcohol), Glyceryl Caprylate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate (Lactic Acid Salt), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Esters, Sclerotium Gum (Sugar Gum), Organic Agania Spinosa (Argan Oil) , Organic Olea Europea (Olive) Oil, D-Alpha Tocopherol Acetate (Natural Vitamin E), Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Seed Oil, Marrubium Vulgare (White Horehound) Stem Cell Culture, Echinacea Stem Cell Culture, Fermented Resveratrol Extract (Probiotic), Organic Argania Spinosa (Argan) Oil, Ubiquinone (CoQ10), Olea Europea (Olive Leaf) Extract, Organic Curcubita Pepo (Pumpkin) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Stem Cells, Glycerophosphoinositol Lysine (from Sunfower).\n\nAs you can see, there are some ingredients that can be problematic for some people, coconut oil and fatty alcohol jump out to me, specifically. Thankfully, I don't have a sensitivity to either. Without getting into the \"whether organic ingredients are actually organic in cosmetics\" issue, I loved that this cleanser had so many oils in it. Rose hips, in particular, work awesome with my skin. \n\n**pH:** Before purchasing, I emailed Acure's customer service to ask about the pH. They responded the next day with this email: \n\nThank you for your interest in ACURE and for taking the time to reach out to us! In regards to the pH of our products, all of our cream and gel based products have a pH of 5-5.5. This is the natural pH of our skin's acid mantle. All of our hair care has a pH of 4-4.5. This is the natural pHof our hair when it is wet. With that being said, all of our formulas are pH balanced! \n\nAt ACURE, we are using plant and food actives to drive real result in the skin. Our Curoxidant Blend makes up the first 5 ingredients in all of our cream-based formulas. Consisting of certified organic acai, blackberry, rosehips, rooibos, and pomegranate, these super fruits and herbs provide powerful free-radical scavenging benefits. This blend helps to balance all of our cream base facial products at a 5.5 pH. Which as I mentioned earlier, matches our own natural acid mantle. This also helps in our skin's natural defenses to bacterial infection and environmental damage.  \n\n Our products are also 100% natural and contain no petrochemicals, sulfates, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde donors, synthetic fragrances, gluten or soy. We are cruelty free, and 100% biodegradable. Our manufacturing facility is also a gluten-free facility. Any aroma that you pick up in our products comes from pure distilled essential oil, about one drop per gallon. We only use non-GMO ingredients. We are also currently applying for non-GMO certification and hope to be able to list that on our website soon. We use certified organic ingredients whenever possible and currently they make up 70% of our ingredients. Nine of our products are 100% certified organic and wear the seal. \n\nThank you again for contacting us! If you are interested, I would be happy to request some samples be sent your way. If you are interested. Please forward us your preferred U.S mailing address.\n\nI tested it when it arrived, and it is a pH 5.5. I was seriously impressed with the prompt and thorough response by customer service, and requested samples of a few other products (which are still en route). I liked that they explain in their email (and ingredients list) what the \"Curoxidant\" blend is, since that sounds like a crock otherwise :) \n\n**Performance:** Y'all. I am not someone who gets hyped up about cleansers. Serums, fancy toners, a kick-ass moisturizer, yes. But a cleanser? Generally, no. (except for you, Skinfood cleansing oil. except for you.) But this stuff is amazing. \n\nIt works equally well as a second cleanser or as a standalone cleanser on nights when I'm rushed. A little goes a long way - I use about a nickel sized amount each evening. It foams up with water, enough to give it some slip for cleansing, but not the harsh-drying bubbles too many cleansers have. It does an awesome job removing my makeup, without screwing with the skin around my eyes (a common reaction to cleansers, for me). At this point, it's a better-than-average cleanser, but probably not worth the $10-$14 you'd spend on it. \n\nBut then, you rinse & dry your face... I have never had something make my skin feel this soft and glowy at first use. Seriously, the texture of my skin after rinsing this off was amazing - I don't know how or why, but I'm not complaining! After two weeks of nightly use, it's still the same - this cleanser does a great job of hydrating my skin without over-moisturizing it, and it's evened out some sensitive/red patches I had leftover from a recent breakout. \n\nThe only possible detraction from this cleanser is the scent - it's very natural (heavily chamomile, to me at least) but pretty strong. I don't mind it, but if you're put off by scents in your product, it's something to be aware of, even though \"fragrance\" isn't an ingredient, so I assume it's the natural odor of the oils. \n\nAll in all, this has quickly reached HG status for me. I'd definitely recommend giving it a shot if you're looking for a new affordable, easily accessible, pH balanced cleanser. ",

Generally things that contain silicone substances can buildup easily in hair, and will usually require a stronger surfectant to remove.\n\nThe amodimethicone would be water soluble if it had both trideceth-12 AND centrimonium chloride, but it seems to be missing the chloride part of the equation so I would say that is a likely culprit. \n\nAlso the divinyldimethicone/dimethicone copolymer is water insoluble, which needs a stronger surfectant to remove.",

Both the SCI and coco betaine have a pH of around there and the SCA has a pH of 9 and I'm assuming the amount I'd like to use will raise the pH significantly. I can always alter it though with a bit of a citric acid solution. I don't want to have to alter the pH too much but I will if it's too high. I think that's about it. I've been looking for shower gel recipes using the surfactants I have, but almost all of them call for decyl glucoside or something else. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!!",

I just recently found out that they are two different ingredients, unfortunately so many people shorten cocoamidopropyl to coco. Just make sure you aren't using anything that's cationic.\n\nSomething I was thinking about today, is if you are using Anionic and amphoteric surfactants and you have it an acidic ph, does that cause any issues since amphoteric turn cationic in an acidic conditions and anionic in alkaline conditions? I just made two cleansers with anionic and amphoteric surfactants and had the ph at 5.5, and I even used honeyquat and silk amino acids which are cationic. I didn't have any issues related to these things, though. I messed up my first one by forgetting to check the ph and the sepimax zen did not hydrate. I know that using cationics with anionics can screw things up. But I don't believe so with the anionic and amphoteric surfactants in a acidic ph. I was wondering how that all works.\n\nETA- make sure you wear a mask with the SCI so that you don't inhale any. Do you already know what phases to put everything?",

I found that apparently saponified products are bad for curly hair (especially long term). Is this true? Is it worse than a sulfate based shampoo? \n\nHi everyone, \nI need help with clearing something up. \nI don't follow a Curly Hair routine to the 100%, but I have a 2b-2c type frizzy hair, and I've found out that following some of the basic principles of a Curly Hair routine do a lot of good to my hair (No sulfates in my shampoo, and no Silicones for my shampoo, my conditioner or mask; also, trying to wash my hair as little as possible, normally once a week). \nI've also really passionate about creating as less waste as possible, and so I strive to buy all of my personal care products plastic free. \nI've already found some plastic free/solid conditioner options, but I've having problems finding a plastic free/solid shampoo option that's also fully CG approved, that's also easily accessible and appropriate for my budget. \n\nI used to use this henna solid shampoo bar from FunkySoapShop (https://www.funkysoapshop.com/henna-solid-shampoo-bar-for-red-auburn-chestnut-shampoo-bar-natural-handmade-approx-120g-c2x29647375) , along with their solid conditioner bar (which is fully CG approved). I felt my hair was wonderful with those. \n\nI thought the solid shampoo was CG approved since it didn't have sulfates. Then I researched further and found out that this bar is done by saponification. So a sort of hair soap. \nFrom what I've found, soap or saponified products are sort of polemical since they have a high pH level and they can be harmful to hair. \n\nThing is, this shampoo bar has been the one I've felt my hair feels the best with. I've tried another CG approved shampoo bars (most of them Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate or sodium cocoyl isethionate based) but I don't feel my hair likes them as well as this \"saponified\" shampoo bar. This shampoo bar is one of the best shampoos for my hair and checked all my boxes (plastic free, handmade/ethical/not made by a huge corporation/whatever, vegan/cruelty-free and price accessible) ... Until this saponification issue. \n\nMy question is, are saponified hair products as bad long-term as told? Are they worse than sulfates? Would someone like me, who follows some main principles of the CG method be heavily affected by a saponified shampoo bar? \n\nThank you in advance for reading up to here and for your help. I live in Belgium.",

    "body": "Hi curlies, I need some help troubleshooting. I feel like I have zero way to predict whether my scalp will like a shampoo or not; some with supposedly \"harsher\" ingredients work great for me and others that are \"gentler\" make me super dry and itchy! I have to stick to low-poo because my low-porosity, medium-thickness 2C hair gets weighed down really easily. I desperately want to experiment with new shampoos but I have no way of narrowing down which ones might work for me!!\n\nHere are some of the products I've tried, how my scalp liked them, and their ingredients.\n\nTHE BODY SHOP GINGER SHAMPOO - Somehow? this is the nicest of all the shampoos I've ever tried on my scalp?? I legitimately don't understand why, it's one of the only things that leaves my scalp feeling calm. I'd like to be able to use something else though because I know all the sulfates are probably really harsh on my curls.\n\nIngredients: Aqua/Water/Eau, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Piroctone Olamine, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Panthenol, Sodium Benzoate, Polysorbate 20, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Gluconate, Dimethicone Propyl PGBetaine, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium Salicylate, Salix Alba Bark Extract/Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Parfum/Fragrance, Linalool, Limonene, Betula Alba Bark Extract, Zingiber Officinale Root Oil/Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Citronellol, Citral, Isopropyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, sr-Spider Polypeptide-1, 1,2- Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n-\n\nPANTENE NUTRIENT BLENDS COMPLETE CURL CARE SHAMPOO - Made me unbearably itchy, red and flaky. The worst of the bunch.\n\nIngredients: Water, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Fragrance, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Polyquaternium-10, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Salicylate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Acrylates Copolymer, Panthenol, Panthenyl Ethyl Ether, Histidine, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil\n\n-\n\nBRIOGEO SCALP REVIVAL MICRO-EXFOLIATING SHAMPOO - This one feels pretty good, but sometimes it leaves my hair feeling too \"squeaky clean\" and I'm not sure if I should be exfoliating my scalp every wash day. \n\nIngredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate*, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil*, Glyceryl Stearate*, Glycerin*, Microcrystalline Cellulose*, Cocamidopropyl Betaine*, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate*, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate*, Hydrogenated Castor Oil*, Lithium Magnesium Sodium Silicate, Panthenol, Xylitylglucoside*, Charcoal Powder*, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil*, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil*, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil*, Mentha Viridis (Spearmint) Leaf Oil*, Anhydroxylitol*, Bisabolol, Menthyl Lactate*, Xylitol*, Polyquaternium-7, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Fragrance (Parfum), Citric Acid*, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n-\n\nBRIOGEO BLOSSOM & BLOOM VOLUMIZING SHAMPOO (which I guess was recently discontinued?) - Feels pretty good as well, some itchiness.\n\nIngredients: Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate*, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine*, Lauramidopropyl Betaine*, Glycerin*, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate*, Polysorbate 80*, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate*, Soyamidopropyldimethylamine Oxide*, Maltodextrin*, Biotin, Panthenol, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate*, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Citrus Tangerina (Tangerine) Peel Oil, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Mentha Viridis (Spearmint) Leaf Oil, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil, Sodium C14-18 Olefin Sulfonate*, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate*, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate*, Polyquaternium-7, Polyquaternium-71, Fragrance, Citric Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid\n\n-\n\nBRIOGEO CURL CHARISMA SHAMPOO - Moderate itchiness on my scalp and also just way too heavy for my hair.\n\nIngredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Lauramidopropyl Betaine*, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate*, Glycerin*, Glycol Distearate*, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine*, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter*, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract*, Rice Amino Acids*, Lactobacillus/Tomato Fruit Ferment Extract*, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil*, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil*, Acanthus Mollis Leaf Extract*, Tocopheryl Acetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice*, Keratin Amino Acids*, Coconut Acid*, Hydrolyzed Quinoa*, Sodium Hyaluronate*, Acyl Coenzyme A Desaturase*, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil*, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil*, Polyquaternium-71, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate*, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Isethionate, Polyquaternium-7, Anhydroxylitol*, Xylitylglucoside*, Xylitol*, Fragrance (Parfum), Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol",

I’m happy to keep using that as my shampoo but I’ve been trying to work out what the ingredient that seems to make my scalp angry is so I can avoid it in other products, and I’m starting to think it could be polyquaternium 10 (or polyquaternium in general). The body shop shampoo doesn’t have it in, but I’ve tried the only curls cleanser & umberto giannini scalp restore and got really itchy both times - and they both have polyquaternium 10 in! It could just be complete coincidence though obviously! I’ve also found I get slightly itchy with boots extra firm mousse which has polyquaternium 16. \n\nI’ve also found that my hair feels instantly dry (as in not wet, not as in straw like) to the touch soon as the water isn’t on it when I’m washing it as if there is a film on it and that doesn’t happen with the body shop shampoo either. \n\nI could be completely off the mark here but I’ve never seen anyone else have the same issue!",

There are a lot of products on the market that contain a lot of chemicals, many of which have by now become familiar sights in ingredients lists. There are an awful lot of them derived from coconut and palm exclusively, but there are also a lot of them that can be derived from other sources. There isn't any regulation currently in place (at least in the United States, that I am aware of) that requires manufacturers to disclose the source of their chemicals, which can lead to a lot of companies falsely claiming that their products are coconut and/or palm free, when they are just the opposite. Some of the chemicals you will see are things like Vitamin A-palmitate. This one in particular can be tricky as it can be found naturally in beef fat, or it can be derived from coconut or palm plants. You see it a lot in milk, particularly milk that is 2% or less milk fat, which would make you think that it is derived from beef fat, but when you start digging, you find out that it is far more readily available (and therefore cheaper for dairies to buy in the quantities they use) to acquire a palm derived version. Now, devil's advocate here, it may be simply that the dairies do not actually know that they are adding a palm derived product into their milk, as they are likely going through a bulk supplier.\n\nI have also come to realize that there are a lot of companies who advertise things as being coconut and/or palm free and are completely unaware that the chemicals they use come from those sources.

There is a big movement to stop using microbeads because they are polluting waterways\n\nThe salicylic acid \"hydrator\" has some potentially beneficial ingredients like the licorice root extract, but it also has dimethicone which could break some people out.  Also, the salicylic acid is only 0.5%, when usually we recommend 2%.  We also don't know if the pH is low enough to actually be effective.\n\nI'm personally just not a fan of benzoyl peroxide. It definitely works for some people, but it can dry out your skin and bleach your towels.  So I stay away.  I think using BHA/AHA products and/or a Pocketderm prescription, along with a gentle cleanser and moisturizer is so much better than Proactiv.",
