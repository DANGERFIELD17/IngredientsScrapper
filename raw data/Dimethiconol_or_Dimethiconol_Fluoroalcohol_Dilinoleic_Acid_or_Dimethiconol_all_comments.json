    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

    "body": "Edit: title should be fatty alcohols not fatty acids but autocorrect thinks for me and sees me type acids a lot so naturally I must’ve meant acids. SIGH. \n\n**WARNING: LONG BUT I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE IT WORTH.**\n\nHey all!\n\nSoooo, years ago, I was a big advocate for the [idea that some people cannot use fatty alcohols](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1y3ql7/simple_tip_for_those_of_us_who_cant_use_fatty/). This was due to my experiences with CeraVe Cream, CeraVe Lotion, Cetaphil Cream, and Cetaphil Lotion, primarily. More, I was using Ziana (.025% tretinoin + clindamycin), which I have a strong suspicion in retrospect was the cause of a form of folliculitis for me (perhaps chemical folliculitis -- there are several types of folliculitis but in this case, acne that is not \"acne,\" but rather born of continuous irritation of the hair follicles). Of course, like *everyone* going through acne, I blamed every skin product I was using except the prescription active that was *designed* to make my acne better. After all, a doctor gave it to me, and a doctor wouldn't give me something that would make me \"sicker.\" \n\nUnfortunately, it turns out that by the time I started to figure this out, it was all way too late. To this day, I have light pitted scarring in places from an 8 month moderate-to-severe zit explosion on my face that never ceased. It has taught me a lot and pressed me to learn a lot about how skin *actually* functions. I was told the entire time I was breaking out that it was just \"purging,\" only to realize what a misnomer \"purging\" kind of is -- implying the skin is holding onto infections waiting to churn out of it's layers rather than comedones -- open or closed -- that are visible, as well as microcomedones that are the beginning of an acne spot but invisible to the naked eye. At the time, purging to me implied that there were acne spots in the deeper layers of my skin waiting to come out. \n\nSo in the process of me flailing, I felt like this class of ingredients that are otherwise harmless were my bane: fatty alcohols. These are stearyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, and cetyl alcohol. After all, they turned up in *everything* that was breaking me out, including the cleansers, so surely it had to be them, right? \n\nFor example, at one point, I was using Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser + CeraVe Cream. What do these products have in common?\n\n**Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser**\n&amp;gt; Water, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, **Stearyl Alcohol**, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben.\n\n**CeraVe Cream**\n&amp;gt;Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20 And **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauryl Lactylate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n\n---\n\nSo being the ingredient hound I am, I connected the dots to \"must be fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives.\" After all, everything else I used had had these ingredients too.\n\n**CeraVe Lotion**\n&amp;gt; Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceteareth-20 and** Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\n**Cetaphil Cream**\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Petrolatum, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, PEG-30 Stearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Propylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n**Cetaphil Lotion** *note - I believe this used to have macadamia nut oil in it when I used it and has since been reformulated. \n\n&amp;gt; Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ceteareth-20, **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Dimethicone, Sodium Levulinate, Sodium Anisate,Caprylyl Glycol, Benzyl Alcohol, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer\n\nHappy, I thought, \"This must be it! I solved it!\" So I cut out fatty alcohol products (which, as I am sure many of you know, is a *massive* pain in the ass) and [tried to facilitate others in doing the same](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ufvym/megalisting_products_without_cetylcetearylstearyl/). In fact, I feel like I was the primary champion of \"it might be fatty alcohols!\" back when this sub was only 25k people, and being as we were all learning from eachother and trusted eachother, many people trusted me in that assumption. After all, I had the proof (supposedly) to back it up.\n\nSo I used the lightest products, such as EltaMD PM (which is a wonderful product, don't get me wrong!). Unfortunately, my skin was parched *all of the time.* It was just sick. It kept breaking out for years after, bottle after bottle of EltaMD PM. Life happened, I was removed from the mod group for inactivity, and I just kept on with it - disappearing from this sub for a long-ass time.\n\nAnd then I started thinking... *what did I use before my skin started down this road?*\n\nBefore I knew jack-all about skin, I used Olay pretty religiously. Olay Regenerist, in the pot, with the fragrance. Yep. This stuff:\n\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Isohexadecane, Niacinamide, Isopropyl Isostearate, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Nylon-12, Dimethicone, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Sodium Peg-7 Olive Oil Carboxylate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ceratonia Siliqua (Carob) Fruit Extract, ** Stearyl Alcohol**, Polyethylene, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Dimethiconol, Polyacrylamide, Fragrance, Peg-100 Stearate, Propylparaben, Cetearyl Glucoside, **Cetearyl Alcohol,** C13-14 Isoparaffin, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, C12-13 Pareth-3, Laureth-7, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica.\n\n*\"[Wait a fucking minute](https://media.giphy.com/media/iAYupOdWXQy5a4nVGk/giphy.gif),\"* she thought. \"That shit has cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol and coconut derivatives all the shit I am avoiding. How the fuck did my face not explode then?\"\n\nSo I did something insane: I tried a cream with fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives that was being recommended on this sub at the time (lol). Some of you may recognize this:\n\n**Cheryl Lee MD Ceramide+**\n&amp;gt;Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Coconut), Petrolatum, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Polyglyceryl -10 Pentastearate, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Isostearyl Isostearate, Cetyl Alcohol, 1,3 Propanediol (from Corn), C10-30 Cholesterol/Lanosterol Esters, Ceramide 3, Phytosphingosine, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Niacinamide, Glycyrrhetinic Acid (Licorice Root), 1,2 -Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Gluconolactone.\n\nAnd you want to know something?\n\n90% of my acne healed in a week. 90% of the acne that had been causing me scars and *ruining my fucking life for years* healed in a fucking **week**. I looked back at all the ingredients for all the products that I had avoided and all the ones I had just been able to use fine as a teenager and by fucking god, what did I miss? **Ceteareth-fucking-20** (sans the cleansers -- I still don't know why my skin hated Cetaphil Gentle, but it turns out that it has broken out with every creamy, non-sudsy cleanser ever, so I've resigned myself to using gentle SLES cleansers for life).\n\nI felt like such a massive asshole. \n\nSo that brings me to now, when I decided on a train on a vacation in NYC to start a skin blog. I had spent those years researching my ass off about skin not to even see what a massive fuckup I had made. I had been able to help my BF bring his eczema 80% into control with bleach bath washes and solve my mom's chronically dry skin and my friend's weird case of eczema on his ring finger, but not my own skin. \n\nI came back to this sub after ~5 fucking years (4 of them AFK) and I still see a lot of people avoiding *all fatty alcohols*. I'm making this post to tell you that it might not be all fatty alcohols. It may be cet-20, like me, or it may be those fatty alcohols in combination with other ingredients (combinations of some ingredients can change molecular sizes, some manufacturers use different sources or molecular sized products, like larger or smaller hyaluronic acid, for example). There's so much complexity with skincare, skin, and ingredients that it usually isn't *one whole class of ingredients*. In short: **your mileage may vary**. This is why spot testing is important, one product isn't for everyone, and while ingredient labels are important for weeding out culprits, you also need to do a bit of research on how ingredients work with others to change how they interact on the skin. \n\nSince then, I've spot tested many of the products I flat-out ruled out and 1. it turns out everything with cet-20 does explode my face, 2. it turns out macadamia nut oil also explodes my face (in the cet lotion), and 3. turns out I can use 50% of the things I thought I couldn't (like jojoba oil!).\n\nI'm so happy that many of you have found this sub educational, but **please** consider what you've used in the past (skincare for face, makeup, EVERYTHING) and don't neglect those products when cross-identifying culprits. It changed my life and it might change yours.\n\nSome takeaways, with bullet points because I love bullet points:\n\n* Don't rule out entire classes of ingredients. Skin is super individual and it may be one stupid ingredient.\n* Don't take all of your skincare advice from the Internet, and if you do, try to diversify. Reddit, acne.org, MakeupAlley, medical journals -- get in there and become your own advocate.\n* Sometimes, skin is just an asshole and you won't be able to figure out what it hates. Example: My skin has issues with CeraVe healing ointment and foaming wash, despite them lacking cet-20. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n* Sometimes, what is considered \"good\" or \"best\" for skin isn't good or best for your skin. Example for me: creamy cleansers. They're definitely recommended *everywhere* for *every* skin condition, esp rosacea (which I have), but my skin fucking loathes them all. No idea why, and that's okay.\n* Just because an ingredient is \"good\" for skin doesn't mean it is good for your skin. Example: Me and high % niacinamide = zits. Me and low % niacinamide = k.\n* Just because it's a prescription doesn't mean it can't fuck you up, fam. I thought prescription = good, no problems here, won't cause issues. I have literal scars to prove me wrong. Instead of assuming all is well, **TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR IF SHIT IS UP AND IF YOUR DOCTOR IS LIKE HEY SHIT IS FINE BUT YOU STILL THINK SHIT IS FUCKED, GO TO ANOTHER DOCTOR**. I wish I had done this. Instead, my doc kept urging me to use it every single night. Went to a new doc and he was like, \"Oh no, your skin is very sensitive, that is wayyyy too harsh.\" Listen to your gut.\n* Almost alll skin rules are more like guidelines (except the baking soda, lemon juice, harsh harsh scrubs stuff - that's all still true since they can all throw your skin very out of whack). Example: I do better with light physical exfoliation once a week than AHA any day.\n\nThanks, and I'm sorry for being such a massive, incorrect asshole. I'm doing my best to correct my errors now (and hopefully go to esthetics school though BF is pushing me to do dermatology).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",

There needs to be someone on the medical side who can vouch for us not being complete loons about our skin. \n\nYes I have to agree with the sentiment of your post.... over the last few years my skin has been freaking out over every little thing. Too hot, too cold, aha, bha, B3, HA, phenoxyethanol the list goes on. \n\nFor 7months I used Tretinoin 0.025% and built up slowly (I thought), the purge happened. Traumatic. Then just unhappy skin.... but it is gold standard for my issues right? My face said no. \n\nAfter becoming ill last year, severely for 6+ months, all skincare and Tret use went down the drain. Just SS once a day, used as moisturiser. Rarely even washed my face in the evening I was too exhausted. \n\nWhat this did, apart from giving me Cc's and what have you. Was a chance for my skin to repair my moisture barrier on my face. Since medication has helped with the symptoms of my illness,  I have been able to use 1 product in my routine with phenoxyethanol as the main preservative, without it giving me painful pustles and nodules everywhere I experienced before. \n\nI have realised that the rash of whiteheads where ever I use a product with HA in and determined was the HA also happens with high levels of BG. So now planning to test a large molecular weight HA serum to see if I have the same issue without the BG. PG is fine... Propanidol is great. \n\nB3 🤔 causes flushing in my skin. And I'm not really interested in trying again.... \n\nBHA, again let me try again at some point. But method of application might be the issue here. \n\nSo vitamin c seemed out of the lexicon for my skin. I now have a silicone based C vit lined up to trial. \n\nFragerance/ essential oils can still mess me up doh. \n\nMoral of this story for me? Concentrate on keeping healthy skin barrier. The rest comes after.... so cleanse (favourite step), treat (calming, hydrating, emollient and then the acne/PIH target), protect. This approach has been working for me so far.",

Things never seem to work the way they're supposed to, and people seem to exclusively rely on anecdotes and personal experiences when giving their recommendations, often repeating things they read in a beauty mag or blog where the main goal is often to sell hair product or push dogma.\n\nSo I've done some digging, to learn a little bit about the real chemistry and science behind your hair care products, to dispel some myths and get to the truth of what's going on with your hair.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387693/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4458934/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19467087\n\n#What is hair?\n\n>*Hair is an integrated system with a peculiar chemical and physical behavior. It is a complex structure of several morphological components that act as a unit. The hair shaft of mammals is divided into three main regions: Cuticle, cortex and medulla. The medulla is present in corser hair like grey hair, thick hair and beard hair, and it is absent in fine hair of children. There is more medulla in the coarser hair of Asians than Caucasians. The medulla may be involved in the splitting of hairs since it provides an area of weakness as a pathway for the propagation of cracks along the axis of the fiber.*\n\n>*The cuticle is a chemically resistant region and consists of flap overlapping scales (keratinocytes) like shingles on the roof. The shape and orientation of the cuticle cells are responsible for the differential friction effect in hair. The cuticle is generally formed by 6–8 scales thick for Asians, slightly less in Caucasians and even less in African hair. A thinner cuticle layer makes African hair more prone to breakage.*\n\n[Image](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1083/7638/files/Hair-Anatomy-e1421050694589.png?v=1505924657)\n\n\n#Why do we shampoo? Is it necessary?\n\nOver time, your hair will develop a build up of dirt and other pollutants (eg: campfire smoke, minerals from hard water) as well as sebum, sweat and dead/peeled skin.\n\nPrior to the 1930's we simply used bar soap to wash our hair. The issue with this is that it would often leave a residue/soap scum on the scalp and hair, which is uncomfortable and aesthetically unpleasing. Shampoo was the answer.\n\nIn recent years, you may have heard that you don't need to shampoo, and that it causes your hair to produce more oils. This is untrue- there is no evidence to support the claim that using shampoo stimulates production of sebum on the scalp, including shampoos that contain sulfates and silicons.\n\nMost proponents of no-poo substitute shampoo with an alternative such as ACV or a specially formulated conditioner that effectively serves the same purpose.\n\n#How does shampoo work?\n\nThe main active ingredient in shampoo is a type of molecule called a surfacant. This is typically a sulfate, with the most common being Sodium Laureth Sulfate and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. You may have heard that all sulfates do is \"create suds\" and damage your hair, this is incorrect.\n\n>*Residues are nonsoluble fats (sebum) that do not dissolve with water. In order to be removed from the hair shaft, surfactants present a hydrophobic molecular portion, and another hydrophilic. The former will chemically bond with the fat, while the latter will bond with the water. The surfactants are generally composed of a chain of fatty hydrocarbons (tail) and a polar head. The polar extremity is capable of giving this portion of the molecule hydrophilic traits that allow it to dissolve in water and wash away the residues.* \n\nWhat this basically means is that one end of the surfacant will attract water, and the other will repel it and attract sebum, allowing it to be washed out of the hair along with the shampoo.\n\nSurfacants can be classified into four groups: Anionic, cationic, amphoteric and nonionic.\n\n[Here's a classifications chart of common surfacants.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387693/bin/IJT-7-2-g001.jpg) \n\n* **Anionic detergents:** Among the most popular surfactants, they are named for their negatively charged hydrophilic polar group. Derived from fatty alcohols, they are very good at removing sebum from the scalp and hair. However, the excessively cleaned hair is harsh, rough, dull with frizz and prone to tangling. Among them, different classes of detergents are available with certain selective properties.\n 1. **Lauryl sulfates:** Popular primary cleansers, they work well in both hard and soft water, produce rich foam, and are easily rinsed. They are excellent cleansers, commonly used in shampoos for oily hair. As the hair becomes harsh and rough, careful selection of a secondary detergent and possible use of a conditioning agent is always required as part of the shampoo formulation. Examples of this class include: Sodium lauryl sulfate, triethanolamine lauryl sulfate, and ammonium lauryl sulfate\n 2. **Laureth sulfates:** These are another class of excellent detergents with good cleansing ability and foaming property which are useful for normal-to-dry hair. Examples of this chemical class are: Sodium laureth sulfate, triethanolamine laureth sulfate, and ammonium laureth sulfate\n 3. **Sarcosines:** They are generally secondary detergents, as they do not remove sebum well from the hair to justify as primary cleansers. They are listed as the second or third on ingredient list of detergents. Excellent conditioners are used in conditioning shampoos and dry hair shampoos. Examples are: Lauryl sarcosine and sodium lauryl sarcosinate\n 4. **Sulfosuccinates:** These are strong detergents commonly used as a secondary surfactant in oily hair shampoos. Examples are disodium oleaminesulfosuccinate and sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate.\n\n* **Cationic Detergents:** In contrast to anionic detergents they have a positively charged polar group. They are poor cleansers and do not lather well and are not compatible with anionic detergents, limiting their utility. However, they are excellent at imparting softness and manageability to chemically damaged hair and so are primarily used as daily shampoo for damaged hair such as in case of permanently dyed or chemically bleached hair. Examples are: Long-chain amino esters, ammonioesters, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride.\n\n* **Amphoteric Detergents:** Having both positively and negatively charged polar group, they behave differently at lower pH (as cationic detergent) and at higher pH (as anionic detergent). Subgroups include the betaines, sultaines, and imidazolinium derivatives. They are used in baby shampoo and for those with fine and damaged hair because they don’t cause stinging in the eyes in children, foam well and leave hair in manageable state. Examples are: Cocamidopropyl betaine and sodium lauraminopropionate.\n\n* **Nonionic Detergents:** They have no polar group and are among the mildest of all cleansers and aid to improve the antistatic qualities of a shampoo. They can be combined with ionic detergent as a secondary cleanser. Examples are: Polyoxyethylene fatty alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol esters and alkanolamides.\n\nAll shampoos contain some variation or combination of these substances to wash your hair. Some sulfate-free shampoos may contain none, but this means that they are basically not effectively cleansing your hair. (most sulfate free shampoos will simply use a surfacant that doesn't contain the word \"sulfate\", though)\n\nHigh end shampoos from salons contain these same ingredients, with the main difference being perhaps nicer smells and a much stronger concentration that requires dilution in water before use.\n\n#####How often should I shampoo?\n\nYou probably do not need to shampoo every day, and you do not need to go weeks without shampooing. Shampoo your hair when it is oily or dirty. Experiment with different shampoos and take a look at the active chemicals that are doing the heavy lifting. \n\n#The benefit of conditioner\n\nModern shampoos are extremely effective. Unfortunately, heavily cleansed hair is not desirable to most, as it is harsh, hard to manage, prone to tangling, and looks dull.\n\nThe solution to this is a conditioner, which are sometimes included in the shampoo itself. \n\nA conditioner is any substance which is intended to enhance feel, appearance, fullness, lubricity, shine, and general manageability of hair. \n\n>*Conditioner molecules contain cationic surfactant which gives a positive electric charge to the conditioner. The negative charge of the hair is attracted to the positively charged conditioner molecules, which results in conditioner getting deposited on the hair, especially on areas where there is degree of weathering. This is true for damaged hair as they are even more negatively charged. Thus, conditioners reduce the static electricity. They also flatten the cuticle scales over the hair shaft, reducing the friction between hair fibers, increasing the reflectance of light which improves shine and color. The smooth feel resulting from conditioner use gives easier combing and detangling in both wet and dry conditions. Conditioners temporarily seal split ends and mend trichoptilosis.*\n\nConditioners will contain a wide variety of ingredients:\n\n* **Cationic surfactants:** Cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, behentrimonium or propyltrimonium, stearamidopropyl dimethylamine. They are considered the backbone of a conditioner\nPolymers: Mono and polypeptides like hydrolyzed proteins (amino acids), polypeptides derived from collagen and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)\n\n* **Bodying agents and thickeners:** Fatty alcohols (e.g. cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol), waxes (e.g. carnauba wax and paraffin wax), or gums (e.g. guar gum) and salt (sodium chloride)\n\n* **Emollients/oily compounds:** These include natural or synthetic oils, but also esters and waxes. Natural oils used in conditioners are, for example, jojoba oil, olive oil, or grape seed oil. The most frequently used synthetic oils are silicone (e.g. dimethicone, dimethiconol, amodimethicone and cyclomethicone) which are even superior to natural oils in terms of film formation, shine and luster. Asian countries have large hair diameters, therefore a higher concentration of silicone is used as compared to that for Caucasian hair (3-5% vs 0.5%)[1]\n\n* **Auxiliary emulsifiers:** Ethoxylated fatty alcohols (e.g. polysorbate-80 or ceteareth-20) which are non-ionic agents seem to be particularly effective at providing emulsion stability if it cannot be acheived by catiionic agents alone in a conditioner.\n\nThe big bogeyman you may notice is silicons. It is not bad for your hair, and not all silicons are equal. If you use a good shampoo with a good surfacant, build-up is not a concern and you likely don't need to worry too much about this. The backlash against silicons cropped up when people decided to eschew sulfates in their shampoo. Many people quickly realized that without proper cleansing, some silicons would build up in the hair over time.\n\nLike all things related to hair care, the key is balance. A fairly comprehensive resource for different types of silicons and how they behave is [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/) on /r/HairCareScience*, keep this in mind when deciding on which hair product to purchase for your hair.\n\n*while /r/HairCareScience has some good information on it and the moderators know their stuff, be wary of basically every comment from the users, as most of them are simply giving others anecdotal advice and spreading bogeymen.\n\n#How to wash and condition your hair.\n\nThe way you apply these products to your hair is undervalued, and doing it properly may have more benefit than you might suspect.\n\nShampoo should be applied starting from the front and working your way to the back. Applying it directly to the top of the head will create friction and cause tangling. \n\nOnce the shampoo has been rinsed from your hair, it's recommended to gently towel dry your hair before applying the conditioner. Conditioner should be applied on the length of the hair, avoiding the scalp.\n\nLeaving conditioner in your hair is not necessary, once the product has been spread over the surface of your hair it has done its job and may be rinsed out completely.\n\nAfterwards the hair may be gently towel dried. \n\n(If your hair is curly, there may be extra steps such as applying a leave-in product while hair is still wet. Using such products on straight thin hair may result in it looking oily and dull.)\n\n#TL;DR?\n\n* Wash your hair when it's dirty/oily. \n\n* There is no evidence to support the claim that sulfates stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more oil than normal.\n\n* Sulfates are not bad for your hair, but may cause it to look dry and become hard to manage. \n\n* Use conditioner or use a less effective surfacant to combat the above problem.\n\n* Silicons are not bad for your hair, most good shampoos will prevent any build up from happening.\n\n* The key to good hair care is not going \"no poo\" or \"sulfate/silicon free\", it's finding the right balance of chemicals to wash your hair and keep it looking good. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I believe your statement to be true that sulfates themselves wont stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more oil. However, washing your hair too often will substantially raise the rate at which your scalp produces oil and thus the rate at which your hair gets greasy. There are two main reasons for this. The first reason is that when you wash your hair and scalp, you'll also inevitably stimulate the skin in that area, creating friction which results in more blood flow that will make the sebaceous glands \"work better\". The second reason is that by washing your hair you'll also remove the oil from your scalp. Leaving your skin in a dry condition. Dry skin will make your sebaceous glands work overtime to fix exactly that problem, as their main function is to lubricate and waterproof your skin. \n\nTldr: Don't wash your hair too often, it will get your hair greasy fast. It can also cause dandruff in the long term by overstimulating the sebaceous glands.\n\nSource: Studied hairdressing and am a barber.",

Because with a brief look earlier I saw the Palmitamide MEA in it and thought it's one of the ceramides (the names are so similar haha!). However, today I saw incidecoder mentioning it as just a viscosity controlling ingredient (and I usually find them quite accurate), but more things came up where I saw something from mdedge [here](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/74188_main.pdf) stating \"Palmitamide MEA (PEA) is an important component of MimyX nonsteroidal cream, Dr. Smith said. PEA is an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties\" but this doctor has a consulting agreement with Stiefel Labs, which manufactures Physiogel. Also came across this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/) but it's testing a synthetic ceramide PC-104 in combination with other things like Palmitamide MEA, grapeseed extract etc. Plus, I remember reading an AMA from kindofstephen where he said \" I think most cosmetic companies would attribute patents as a marketing cost. Most novel patents I've seen in the cosmetic industry are to deal with delivery vehicles (like an airless soft container, etc)\". My takeaway is things can be patented even if they're not doing too much, because to consumers it seems like it's doing a lot? And now idk if this ingredient/Physiogel is any good as a ceramide cream or it's just a good plain heavy moisturiser.\n\nEdit: Realised this ingredient is present in Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume, along with SK-Influx, where it's described as \"Atoderm Intensive Baume quickly stops itching and reduces the urge to scratch thanks to its anti-itching dermatological active ingredient PEA\"\n\nMy understanding is Physiogel doesn't have any ceramides or cholesterol/phytosterols (looks like Zeroid uses phytosterols in place of cholesterol?), but has PEA as a fatty acid (skin similar ingredient), so it must be a good moisturiser but not an ideal-ratio ceramide moisturiser.",

    "body": "I’m about to drop a lot of information here, but please read! I learned a lot about how to properly use sulfates and silicones, so I want to share!! \n\nSo here’s what I’ve learned from Sarah Tran, who has thigh length hair. \n\nEdit: People have brought up genetics. Of course genetics is a huge factor in hair length, but the point of this post is to maintain *healthy* hair, so that it will grow with minimal breakage and split ends. I bring up her length because it is *healthy* as well as long. \n\nAlso note: silicones and sulfates won’t directly contribute to hair growth, but will make your hair stronger and less likely to break and fall out, indirectly resulting in longer fuller hair\n\nFirst off, silicones and sulfates are NOT bad. In fact, if she didn’t use silicones, she couldn’t protect her hair and have such long hair without split ends. The way most people USE silicones is bad though. \n\nThink about it like this: If you have a pair of high heels that are comfortable and you love them, but your friend asks you to go jogging, the shoes are not the problem, the *use* is.\n\nSilicones do the following: \n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair which makes it easier to detangle \n\n-Provides UV protection\n\n-Seals in moisture to prevent dryness\n\n-Makes hair look shiny\n\n-Reduces frizz and adds definition to curls\n\n-Softens and smooths cuticle\n\nSilicones do all these amazing things!!!! However, there are 4 types: airy, friendly (easy to wash out), resilient, and NO GO silicones\n\n*\n#Airy silicones: \nThese evaporate out of the hair after 10 minutes to a few hours. These do not have any negative effect on hair:\n\n-Cyclomethicone \n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n*\n#Friendly silicones:\nThese wash out of the hair with sulfate free shampoos:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate) \n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n*\n#Resilient Silicones:\nThese do NOT build up on the strand, but are non soluble and *require a sulfate* to remove:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone -Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n*\n#NO GO Silicones:\nThese require multiple washes with sulfate shampoo to remove. NEVER USE THESE!:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone \n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone \n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18 \n\n-Cetyl Phosphate \n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiylamodimethicone \n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n*\n#Mild Sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nThese are Best used to remove airy and friendly silicones and in your regular, daily mild shampoo. These do NOT remove resilient silicones. \n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n*\n#High Strength HARSH sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nTreat these exactly like harsh sulfates and avoid them when looking for a regular, daily mild sulfate-free shampoo. BEST USED FOR REMOVING RESILIENT SILICONES:\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate \n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n*\n#SULFATES that remove silicones:\nThese strong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Mild sulfates May require more applications to remove resilient silicones:\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n*\n#Also here is a list of cationic (anti-static) ingredients:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n*\n#So basically:\n\n1. Get a good sulfate free shampoo\n\n2. Get a good shampoo that HAS sulfates\n\n3. Use airy and friendly silicones ALL the time\n\n4. Use resilient silicones once or twice a month. This will protect your hair more than friendly silicones. Resilient silicones must be washed out with a SULFATE shampoo at the max FIVE DAYS AFTER APPLICATION\n\n*\n#And one last thing!!! Avoid these ingredients in hair care products: \n\nhttps://airtable.com/shrXz5xqoqRg8yKI2/tblol3s4T5YH103yY\n\nIt is hard to find a product with NONE of these ingredients, so make sure that these

        "body": "Hi! Guys please do your research and don't trust everything you hear. Having thigh length hair is a great achievement but it doesn't make someone a science expert, so posting this on a science sub is so misleading. \n\nI'm seeing some red flags. First off, no scientific sources. Second, commonly demonized ingredients in the push for \"clean\" beauty are again demonized here without proper given cause. And third, there are a few things that stuck out to me as glaringly false from what research I've done. Lastly, fourth, the phrasing at all of \"no go silicones\" and just the incorrect categorization of silicones that assigns them value (better to look at the truer category names: volatile, amine-modified, etc.)\n\nMost ingredients on that \"blacklist\" have little or absolutely no evidence of being bad. \n\nAnd the thing that strikes me as absolutely false is the list of cationic surfactabts as static causing, when most research and literature says the exact opposite - that they're anti static ingredients. Give me a minute and I'll add a few sources for the anti-static claim for cationic surfactants.\n\n> The widely used cationic surfactant docosyltrimethylammonium chloride was overall well performing, especially when it came to reduction of friction force and reduction of flyaway hair during combing. It was superior to the other cationic surfactant tested regarding reduction of frizz. This study suggests that the silicones and protein derivatives showed less promising results regarding the overall manageability. Preliminary data has implications that the efficiency of anti-frizz is correlated with cationic charge and high hydrophobicity of the conditioning agent. \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DYduaceeTnvMJ \n\n> Behentrimonium chloride and Cetrimonium chloride are known to be very effective hair conditioners with detangling, anti-frizz, and anti-static  \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3D0FbAuscGO8AJ",

    "body": "Silicones are the focus of many a haircare discussion. They smooth, soften, and shine the hair cuticle, protect from UV, humidity, and heat styling, and can temporarily repair damaged locks. But they may also be hard to remove and build up on certain people with certain routines, leaving an undesirable greasiness, limpness, and dry strands. \n\nSilicone behavior thus varies widely by type and can either be a pro or con for your haircare regimen. Here is a list of many kinds of silicones and specific information on what they do. They’re organized into subclasses that pertain to their wash-out and build-up capacities. Within these subclasses, they’re listed alphabetically along with more info on any noteworthy properties beyond conditioning.\n\n\n**Group 1: Evaporative**     \nAlso known as volatile molecules. These silicones will completely evaporate from your hair anywhere from 10 minutes to a few hours after application, so there’s no worry about build up or moisture lock out with these (but also no conditioning effect from these alone). For this reason they’re most used only as delivery systems for other ingredients, as they distribute into a thin, uniform film before evaporation. Additionally, unlike short-chain alcohols, these won’t carry off moisture. \n\n- Cyclomethicone and other cyclo-XXX-siloxane ingredients – note that these are not soluble in water, so won’t wash out easily if applied right before or in the shower. They will evaporate away afterwards, however, so it doesn’t matter and can actually help against hygral fatigue. They can also be beneficial for increased ease of combing when hair is wet after washing.    \n\n- Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane     \n- Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane     \n- Hexamethyldisiloxane      \n- Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane     \n\n**Group 2: Easy Wash Out**     \nThese silicones don’t evaporate, so they are useful as conditioning agents to get smoother and softer hair with less frizz. They also protect hair from UV radiation, heat styling, and humidity and spread out evenly. They do wash out with nonionic surfactants and co-washing, so again there’s not much concern about these. There are a few caveats to this, however. Larger molecules are more water resistant, especially in hot water, so may need a sulfate shampoo depending on the amount applied. They may also block out moisture from the hair if the user goes a very long time without washing with something besides water. \n\n- Any sort of PEG/PPG modified Methicone or Dimethicone (unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient) - hygroscopic, so may pull moisture out of hair in dry weather. Subtler conditioning effect. Irritation reduction, so good for sensitive skin/scalps.        \n- Diphenyl Dimethicone – high shine     \n- Dimethicone (unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient, then Group 3)     \n- Dimethiconol     \n- Disiloxane     \n- Dimethicone copolyol (unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient, then Group 3) – hygroscopic, so may pull moisture out of hair in dry weather. Subtler conditioning effect. Irritation reduction, so good for sensitive skin/scalps.\n- Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane     \n- Lauryl methicone copolyol     \n- Phenyltrimethicone – high shine     \n- Silica – increased body     \n- Silicone resin - increased body     \n- Silsequioxanes – increased body     \n- Siloxysilicates (e.g. Diisostearoyl Trimethylolpropane Siloxysilicate) – increased body          \n- Trisiloxane     \n\n**Group 3: Hard to Wash, But No Build Up**     \nTake care when using these silicones, as they don’t wash out easily – only a clarifying shampoo with anionic or zwitterionic surfactants will get the job done. Otherwise, hair may dry out over time. These silicones don’t build up though, as subsequent layers are repelled by the first, so there won’t be an increasing feeling of weight and greasiness (the exception to this is amine-funcationalized silicones in the presence of a cationic surfactant - if hair is in a product of this formulation for long enough, the silicone will continue to deposit until it is exhausted from the solution). One may choose to use this ingredient if they want the extreme conditioning benefits and plan on using clarifying shampoo on a weekly or biweekly basis. I personally would only recommend these as leave in conditioners to people with damaged hair who heat style and have already tried other conditioners, as these molecules have a greater affinity for the more negatively charged surface of damaged hair. This makes that one layer of product hard to remove, but very effective. Just remember that once on, neither water nor other product is getting underneath to the hair until you clarify (coconut oil for example will only sit on top and be greasy).\n\n- Aminopropyl Dimethicone (unless in the presence of a cationic surfactant - then Group 4)       \n- Amodimethicone – potential for irritation (unless in the presence of a cationic surfactant - then Group 4)      \n- Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone     \n- Dimethicone, Dimethicone PEG/PPG, or a -dimethylsiloxane in the presence of another cationic polymer ingredient such as anything ending with bromide or chloride and polyquaternium ingredients     \n- Dimethicone crosspolymer     \n- Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer     \n- Aminopropyltriethoxysilane   \n\n**Group 4: Hard to Wash, Builds Up**      \nThe most difficult silicone to work with. These ingredients are powerful conditioners, but will build up with repeated use, causing greasiness and weighing hair down (which negatively impacts natural texture). They’re also hard to get out – all need a clarifying shampoo, and some may even need multiple washes with one in order to remove completely. Without removal, moisture can be blocked out of the hair shaft, resulting in dry strands and potential breakage. We recommend that you avoid these ingredients altogether. \n\n- Behenoxy dimethicone     \n- Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone      \n- Cetyl dimethicone     \n- Cetearyl methicone  \n- Dimethiconol hydroxystearate         \n- Polysilicone-18 Cetyl Phosphate     \n- Propyl Dimethicone – increased body    \n- Stearoxy dimethicone     \n- Stearyl dimethicone         \n- Stearyl methicone      \n- Trimethylsiylamodimethicone – irritation potential     \n\n\nI'll add more to the list as I become aware of them.

Lately with the economy and all, Im having to make some sacrifices which is say goodbye to my Kérastase Elixir Oil. I purchased three different drugstore hair oils to test and I came to the conclusion that this Pantene hair oil is just as good! It has a runny consistency similar to the Elixir oil as well. In the “dupe” scale Id give it a 9. It’s not a 10 because Kérastase is Kérastase in my opinion, but it’s definitely an amazing dupe. The ingredients aren’t similar, but the effect on the hair is. Here are the ingredients for both products:\n\nKérastase Elixir Ultimate Oil ingredients: Cyclopentasiloxane • Dimethiconol • Zea Mays / Corn Germ Oil • Argania Spinosa Oil / Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil • Camellia Kissi / Camellia Kiss Seed Oil • Pentaclethra Macroloba Oil / Pentaclethra Macroloba Seed Oil • Linalool • Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone • Limonene • Coumarin • Benzyl Alcohol • Parfum / Fragrance.\n\nPantene Miracle Rescue Regenerative Oil ingredients: Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Panthenyl Ethyl Ether, Tocopherol, Fragrance\n",

    "body": "Garmi aaa gayi haiiii\\~ dhoop badh hui hai aur heatwaves pardhaar chuke hai 🥵🥵 obviously we need sunscreens! I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae](https://preview.redd.it/04x8cx1jvsy81.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db29ff28ad9fbcd3ff56a158d60e872ed63cb538)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\nand that's all from my side! I know its not much but then again kangaal haalaat mein kharidaari mushkil hai 💀. anyway, here's a list ss that I do want to try once this lot is finished:\n\n* sunscoop sunscreen serum (only if dermaco doesnt work lmao. really intrigued)\n* Face shop sunscreens (itne variants . ek try karne ka mann hai 😖)\n* beauty of joseon rice ss (stock mein aaja bhai 😫)\n* missha sun aqua gel and essence (bas aise hi lol)\n\nI've also tried the neutrogena ultra sheer, episoft , a few banana boat ones but way long ago so I don't clearly remember them to give the verdict on them. just if I haven't repurchased them, consider that they didn't work well for me.\n\nhope this was informational and you guys enjoyed! if you still have any other questions related to the product above, feel free to comment!",

    "body": "Edits: Tried to fix some formatting issues. \n\n—\n\nHi everyone! \n\n[In my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/?st=JIATDG0T&sh=d905c745), I talked at length about the skin condition of rosacea -- what it is, the subtypes, what the causes are, the foundations in treatment (cleansing and moisturizing), as well as treatments and beneficial ingredients. This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

I saw your science of rosacea post  and it pinged an area I've been struggling with. I always have very dry lips, despite drinking plenty of water and using a combo of Laniege lip mask and aquaphor lip ointment. I LOVE lipstick and it makes me really sad that my lips are constantly peeling despite my best efforts. (1) Is this a rosacea thing? (2) Any luck with HG products to help it?   \n\n\nI also have a rage spot on one eyelid. It is the first to flake if I go overboard on new stuff. Annoying but a helpful tool.",

(also coming up) don't even remember this one clearly, but much expected difference wasn't seen , sadly.\n\n**status** : not in use\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**L'Oréal  Revitalift 1.5% Hyaluronic Acid Serum**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 999 for 30ml (bought for Rs. 550) from nykka\n\n**humectants** : glycerin, hyaluronic acid and pentalene glycol\n\n**for skin types** : all! dry, sensitive, oily , combo and acne-prone\n\n**texture and appearance** : clear liquid . unscented.\n\nHG HA acid forever!! finally found it! tried the 15ml variant first and loved it instantly . super hydrating and soothing. not sticky and absorbs within 2-3 minutes. great base for the whole routine and still going on after 3 months ! not irritating or stingy on sensitive skin at all as well as good for oily skin too since its a lower concentration! loveeee\n\n**status** : still in use\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***NEW!*** **minimalist lactic acid 10% + HA 1%**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 30ml (bought for Rs. 570)\n\n**humectants** : lactic acid , aloe vera juice, hyaluronic acid, propanediol, ethoxydiglycol, glycerin.\n\n**for skin types** : TBD\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale-clear yellow . sour scent but no added perfume. really thin and watery.\n\njust got this . will update in a few months !\n\n**status** : TBD\n\n**rating** : TBD\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***NEW!*** **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Water Essence Serum**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1790 for 50ml (bought for Rs. 1253) from maccaron\n\n**humectants** : glycerin, hyaluronic acid , betaine, sodium pca, trehalose, panthenol, pentalene glycol, butylene glycol, beta-glucan and polyquaternium-51 .\n\n**for skin types** : TBD\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid . unscented.\n\njust got this , so verdict is coming soon!\n\n**status** : TBD\n\n**rating** : TBD\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**gels**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pond's Super Light Gel**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 430 for 247gm (bought for Rs. 365) from nykka\n\n**humectants** : glycerin, butylene glycol, sodium pca, hyaluronic acid, pentylene glycol\n\n**for skin types** : dry, oily , combo and acne-prone\n\n**texture and appearance** : light blue liquidy-gel . heavily scented  ( has different citrus extracts) .\n\ngood! really lightweight and hydrating. has a very heavy citrus like smell and definitely wouldn't recommend for sensitive skin. isn't greasy at all and absorbs well. great for both winters and summers and even use it on my body!\n\n**status** : still in use\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and MRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Neutrogena hydro boost water gel**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1000 for 50 ml ( bought for Rs. 855) from nykka\n\n**humectants** : glycerin, butylene glycol, dimethiconol , hyaluronic acid\n\n**for skin types** : dry , oily, combination and acne-prone\n\n**texture and appearance** : light blue liquidy-gel . scented .\n\namazingggg! could've been my HG if it wasn't for the price 🤡. still really hydrating and light. best gel for acne-prone skin as it really decreased the no. of outbreaks and soothes all aggravation. again is scented, so not the best choice for sensitive skin. prefer this over ponds but the cost sis 🥲\n\n**status** : not in use\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and MRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**moisturizers**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 400 for 45ml (bought for Rs. 360) from nykka\n\n**humectants** : glycerin, pentylene glycol , xylitol, caprylyl glycol, mannitol , rhamnose and fructooligosachharides.\n\n**for skin types** : dry , sensitive and acne-prone.\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick white cream. unscented.\n\ngodsent. literally. HG moisturizer besides Cetaphil DAM (cheaper alternative) . boon for sensitive and dehydrated skin. skin saver during my whole tretinoin journey. extremely hydrating and soothing. works similar to boroline on dry patches around nose and mouth . and non-pore clogging! admittedly a little heavy and non-absorbing which is why I might not use it in summers.\n\n**status** : still in use\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand that's all from my side !!also I did not use all of these products at the same time. I'm writing everything from memory since some products were used +3 years ago . even those still in use, I alternate between them on days since I don't need to apply them everyday and all. so most of my products last for a very long time since I combined them and alternate between them. of course, patch test first and thankfully, none of them reacted in a bad way!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsuggestions from the subreddit \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nfollowing products were subreddit recs and I haven't used them at all , so ya'll can search more about them an maybe give them a try!\n\n* irem hyaluronic acid serum (HA)\n* pyungkang yul mist toner\n* inkey list polyglutamic acid\n* herbivore cloud jelly serum\n* the ordinary NMF moisturizer\n\nthere are a lot more but I'm too lazy to read all of them . do mention your HG in the comments!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthere are many other humectants that I haven't mentioned , like niacinamide which is present in trace amounts in almost all products. personally, never tried any products with honey extract in it (I figured snail mucin does a better job , but who knows) . for newer products, ill update them one I'm done trying them for at least 2 months (or let me know if you guys want it any earlier , I got no issues)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nanyway I hope this list helps out ! I didn't have any knowledge about humectants while my skin was being tortured by over-exfoliation and I was looking like a baboon's ass so take care of your skin so it doesn't look like this 🥵 also this took a long time , so leaving an upvote will feel nice 🥰",

Normal is the operative word here because ain't nobody washing their face like actors in a commercial,that's clearly abnormal.\n\n🐳 **What works** : This was recommended by my dermat after a bout of eczema 2 years back and I absolutely swear by it. It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured. [I brought mine from this one.](https://instagram.com/_vivanka_chennai?igshid=5brie36vc4w2)\n\n\n\n🔵 **TONER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **DermaFique All Important Toner** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260\n\n🐳 **Application** : I got this transferred into a mist spray bottle because I quite enjoy the feeling of being spring irrigated. So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you!

I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!\n\nIngredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm really excited about this section. I'm not happy that Korea is and has been for years, swamped in pollution from the winds carrying it over. There is a lot of microdust and even people with resilient skin reported getting redness & severe irritation from the pollution. Everyone has to wear these giant masks, sometimes special ones, and limit their exposure to the world outside of their homes.*\n\n*So there has been a lot of push for soothing, calming products and \"clean\" ingredients. A lot more focus on repairing the skin barrier. So I'm excited about those, but not the fact that people have to suffer.*\n\n*I'll be bolding some of the soothing, repairing and/or skin-identical ingredients in the ingredient lists. I don't know every good ingredient, but I will bold the ones that I do know of. Some other beneficial ingredients as well.*\n\n*\\*Also got random pictures of the textures of the creams and the users who posted it.*\n\n*If you're interested in barrier repairing/replenishing as I am, here are some good quotes from Susan, from Swift Crafty Monkey blog:*\n\n>**Natural moisturizing factor (NMF)** is found within the corneocytes, and makes up 20% to 30% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum. It **consists of amino acids (40%), sodium PCA (12%), lactate (12%), urea (7%), ions (18.5%), sugars (like glycerol – 8.5%)**, and a few other things. These are water soluble [humectants](https://swiftcraftymonkey.blog/better-crafting-through-chemistry/) (meaning they draw water out of the atmosphere to our skin) that have a huge impact on the biochemical and mechanical properties of our skin. Having an adequate NMF level in our skin can prevent or reduce skin tightness, cracking, scaling, and flaking. It improves our skin’s plasticity (thanks to the interactions of the amino acids with keratin) and helps maintain skin’s barrier properties.  \n>  \n>**Filaggrin** is a really important protein found in our skin! ...When we are in more arid climates, the filaggrin breakdown increases to produce more NMF. More NMF is a good thing!  \n>  \n>The contents of the NMF do more than act as humectants. The lactate and potassium can affect the pH and stiffness of the stratum corneum. The lactic acid stimulates ceramide biosynthesis and improves barrier function. The [hyaluronic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan) (HA – picture to the left) maintains hydration and structural integrity of our skin. It also interacts with intercellular lipids and regulates the mechanical properties of the stratum corneum.  \n>  \n>\\[The strateum corneum lipids\\] make up about 15% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum, and contain about **40% to 50% ceramides, 20% to 25% cholesterol, 15% to 25% fatty acids** (those with C16 to C30 chain lengths, with C24 to C28 being the most common), and **5% to 10% cholesterol sulfate**.  \n>  \n>Oils with **linoleic or gamma-linoleic acid** are always welcomed by our skin (like sunflower, sesame seed, borage, evening primrose, rice bran, and others), especially in the winter.\n\n**Squalane, beeswax, lecithin, lanolin** are also good skin replenishing ingredients.

They often end in -ate or “glucoside”.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or “methosulfate” (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application.

Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt’s best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the “feeling” of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this “protein overload” is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it’s wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

Maybe I give it a try LRP toleraine, it looks a good option too.\n\nI have cicaplast but I just use on my armpits as I burned it with my razor. Don't ask, I did stupid thing. I was thinking try using on face, I don't know if I will like it haha\n\nI will try corsx mask, I had on my wishlist long time. Do you apply moisturizer and this after or just this mask?",

Here in EU I can't find on their website confirmation of percentage of retinaldehyde of Ystheal but I read on several pages that Ystheal= 0.05 & their triacneal contains 0.1. Think I'll buy both to compare.\n\nAnd a tip as you said LRP face wash was HG, it might be an idea to buy the 400 ml LRP toleriane next time. Have it myself and bought it for 13 euro @ farmaline.",

I hate it when something works really well for me and they go reformulate the whole thing. The money spent is no joke either.\n\nI realized too late and already applied it on my whole face without patch testing first so... we'll see how it goes\n\nSo far though...\nConsistency wise, new formula is a bit more watery compared sa old na very thick. \n - New feels a little lighter and less greasy vs. Old thats heavier to the point that u can feel it on you even on the back of my hand.\n - Maybe it could be a good thing with the PH weather. Cant say if the new one is less moisturizing yet but comparing them on my hands, Old formula is more slippery/greasy, new one feels a little matte thats slightly greasy if that makes sense?\n\nScent wise, theres a subtle difference but new one is still unscented.\n\nI'll update in maybe a week and see how it goes. Hopefully it still performs the same and nothing happens to me lmao. So far naman I'm not itching yet lol\n\nHere are the ingredients for comparison!\nTLDR the little search I did: \"One of the former occlusives used was Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, which was replaced by much lighter, less occlusive emollients like ethylhexyl stearate and dicaprylyl carbonate.\" + Added Madecassoside\n\nOLD\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Stearic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Palmitic Acid, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Arachidyl Alcohol, C14-22 Alcohols, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA(Ceramide PC-104), Polyacrylate-13, Arachidyl Glucoside, Mannitol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Polyisobutene, Glyceryl Caprylate, Panax Ginseng Root Water, Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Carbomer, Perilla Ocymoides Seed Extract, Myristic Acid, Arachidic Acid, Cholesterol, Bupleurum Falcatum Root Extract, Angelica Acutiloba Root Extract, Ophiopogon Japonicus Root Extract, Glucose, Silica, Glycine Max (Soybean) Oil, Ceramide NP, Phytosphingosine, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Tocopherol, Canola Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract\n\nNEW\nPurified water, butylene glycol, glycerin, ethylhexyl stearate, dimethicone, dicaprylyl carbonate, behenyl alcohol, stearic acid, palmitic acid, cetyl ethylhexanoate, hydrogenated poly(C6-14 olefin), 1,2-hexanediol, arachidyl alcohol, C14-22 alcohol, cetyl-pigmentohydroxyethyl palmitamide (ceramide CPP-40 7622 ppm), polyacrylate-13, mannitol, arachidyl glucoside, C12-20 alkyl glucoside, hydrogenated polyisobutene, glyceryl caprylate, ethylhexylglycerin, polyglyceryl-10 laurate, hydrogenated lecithin, ethylhexyl palmitate, Dimethiconol, Ginseng Water, Carbomer, Sorbitan Isostearate, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Gold Extract, Propanediol, Cholesterol, Silica, Plum Extract, Arachidic Acid, Black Soybean Oil, Squalane Madecassoside, Polyglyceryl-10 Pentastearate, Tocopherol, Ceramide NP (4ppm), Oleic Acid, Phytosphingosine, Pentylene Glycol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Canola Oil, Rosemary Leaf Extract",

I used it side by side one day and the side with the new formula didn’t feel as heavy and the finger swipe wasn’t as greasy.\n* I’m not sure if its viable as a morning moisturizer now, but I did use it as such under my Omi Sunbears Sunscreen. \n   * I avoided using this sunscreen when I damaged my skin barrier as it dried so matte it made my skin so dry and my old moisturizers *(Hyaloo and Klued)* weren’t enough for it. But the new formula was just right to keep me moisturized but not oily with this sunscreen\n\nPART 1/2",

Please do like, share,  subscribe and don't forget to hit the bell icon!... lmao jk\n\n**Skin Type** : Oily - Combination, Comedonal Acne Prone, Rosacea Prone,\n\n**Major skin concerns** : Hypersensitivity, Non inflammatory acne, Sebum Production. \n\n**Age** : Early - Mid 20s, F\n\n**Current Climatic Conditions** : Semi- Arid, Dry winter \n\nSpecie : Homo Sapien\n\nHeight : wait.. I'm not supposed to divulge all these details! \n\n**Product reviews** :\n\n*Note* : None of these products have been used by me on a strictly daily basis, except for a week (or two) in a row during vacations, as I rarely step out of the house (lockdown, duh!) and don't apply sunscreen indoors (\\*gaasp\\* 😨)   \n Rest assured, I've reapplied some when out, and have used them on and off in a span of 6 months. \n\nFrom L-R \n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/s2C99g0N/IMG-20211119-184403.jpg\n\n\n**1-  Nivea Sun Protect And Moisture, moisturising sun and collagen protection SPF 50+ PA++++** \n\n**Quantity** **- Price** : 125 ml - ₹495 MRP\n\n(bought on Amazon for ₹396)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua, Octocrylene, Glycerin, Titanium Dioxide, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Alcohol Denat, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Panthenol, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Myristyl Myristate, Silica, Cetyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Stearyl Alcohol, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Methylparaben, Dimethicone, Trisodium EDTA, Ethylparaben, Sodium Citrate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citric Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hydroxide, Linalool, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Eugenol, Coumarin, Methyl Benzoate, Benzoic Acid, BHT, Parfum/Fragrance\n\n**Texture** : White - Chalky Color. Medium - Thick Consistency   \n , you have to rub it in for a while for it to get completely absorbed, medium drying speed. Kinda greasy, semi matte finish. Leaves a moderate white cast, not a ghastly one though. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. Smells mostly of Alcohol! (it's one of the ingredients, so obviously..), fragrance is definitely not unnoticeable, but I don't mind it for my body, lingers around for a while. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : Hell yeah! It won't wear off unless you bathe, it survives water splashes and friction from clothes. Be careful while applying it on your feet though, I slip a lot while walking, esp when there's a rush and I put on sandals right after applying it. Give it ample time to dry before stepping out. \n\n**Reapplication** : Since the lotion sits thick on the skin, reapplication is not a bliss, the white cast becomes more noticeable after reapplication, and if you sweat after, oh god it feels a heavy /sticky mess lol, also tends to attract dust, but it's for the body, so I can compromise. 🤷‍♀️\n\n**Overall experience** : It's the best body sunscreen I've tried so far, with the highest protection and I think the brand can be trusted for its spf claims. \n\nI tried using it on my face once, oh nooo, I will never do that again! it kept moving around and just wouldn't get absorbed, plus it stung like hell because of the alcohol, and I literally felt like I was applying fevicol!   \n For my body, yep a thumbs up! \n\n\\*But\\*, if you get acne on your arms  (my arms have a tendency to break out / get textured if I use the wrong product) it wouldn't be the best choice, it seals and chokes the pores, I'd prefer something lighter. I usually wear tops/suits with long sleeves, so not much of the arm is exposed. below the elbow it feels comfortable enough. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WRP**, Hit! (for the body) \n\n**2- Iba Halal Invisible Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++**   \n **Quantity - Price** : 80 ml - ₹395 MRP\n\n(I bought it on Amazon for ₹ 337)\n\n**Ingredients** : WATER CONTAINING EXTRACTS OF ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) EXTRACT & HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) WATER, WATER & ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE & BENZOPHENONE-3 & BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE & PHOSPHOLIPIDS & 1,3-BUTYLENE GLYCOL & PHENOXYETHANOL, GLYCERINE, AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/BEHENETH-25 METHACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL AND TRIETHYLENE GLYCOL, ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE, ALUMINIUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE, NIACINAMIDE (VITAMIN B3), TITANIUM DIOXIDE, PERFUME, DISODIUM EDTA, SODIUM HYDROXIDE\n\n**Texture** : White color. Light lotion - cream consistency, very lightweight and water like, kind of runny, it trickles down when you place a dallop on the palm and tilt it.   \n The Best consistency of a sunscreen I've used so far! Not at all heavy, takes some time to dry, esp when using larger amounts (I use 2-3 finger lengths) and still it doesn't feel too much on my face, easy to work with, requires a lot of gentle massaging because it's watery and takes some time to dry and settle in. High dry time.   \n It contains no silicones! My oily skin loves it! Doesn't give a matte finish though, on the glossy (satin?) side, but nothing bothersome.  \n Doesn't leave a white cast! On the Low I'd say, because of the presence of Titanium Dioxide. Absolutely love the texture. Skin feels very hydrated and plump and non greasy. (taaza nikhaar 😆) \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Has a \"fresh\" smell, (bamboo room freshener? idk something like that), moderate level, doesn't linger a lot. I haven't found a \\*good\\* fragrance free budget (\\*my\\* budget) friendly sunscreen yet. So I'm okay with this for now. Sometimes I'm guilty of enjoying the fragrance 😅 because all other products I use are strictly fragrance free. \n\n**Water Resistant?** :  Nope, doesn't survive water splashes or sweat (it won't come off completely in a single splash though, will wash off when sweating profusely) white colored droplets roll down the face if out in the sun for long. (the survival time is slightly more than the La Shield urban protection mineral sunscreen gel though) \n\n**Reapplication** : Breezy! Since it's lightweight, although, you might experience some moving around if there's a \\*lot\\* of product, I'd suggest applying pea by pea instead of taking a finger length at one go, I squeezed out a good amount once while in the car and kept massaging it in for a couple minutes (or more) and felt embarrassed at the weird looks my family and people outside the car gave me.. So yeah.. lol.  It doesn't feel uncomfortable after layers have been built up. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I love it! Although I'm not sure if the sunscreen has undergone the required tests to justify the actual sun protection claims, but that's all I got so far, it fits my requirements of no silicones, negligible white cast, high declared protection, non oily texture, and most importantly budget! \n\nOne important point, it stings when used after physical / chemical exfoliation. So you may want to avoid it after threading / waxing / scrubbing / masking / exfoliating.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Hit! **WRP** (for face) \n\n**3- La Shield Pollution Protect Mineral Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹280 MRP\n\n(bought it on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Purified Water, Octinoxate, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Caprylyl Methicone, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Diisopropyl Adipate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetearyl Alcohol, Brassica Campestris/Aleurites Fordi Oil Copolymer, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Phenoxyethanol, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, C20-22 Alcohols, Isohexadecane, Fragrances, Aluminium Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 60, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trolamine, Disodium Edetate, Sorbitan Isostearate\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Light - Medium gel - cream consistency. Lightweight. Doesn't require a lot of rubbing in. Doesn't move around a lot. Leaves a Low- Moderate white cast. Not the kind typical to mineral sunscreens, but more than the Iba Halal sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Lingers.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Naah, it melts away almost instantly if you happen to sweat while applying it, just a spray (accidental rain drop for example) on the face and it wears off from that spot, minor sweating and it rolls down the cheeks, doesn't adhere to the skin. \n\n**Reapplication** : Medium ease. Moves around, kind of sticky when built up. Medium White cast (visibly noticeable) after reapplication. \n\n**Overall Experience** : Um, I had expected a better performance from this one, looking at the ingredients and all, but it stings around the eyes, and on the face, makes my face somewhat tacky, my face becomes oily by afternoon (if applied in the morning). Personally I didn't like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Miss. **WNRP**.\n\n**4-  La Shield Fisico Matte Sunscreen Gel SPF 50+ PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹630 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹441)\n\n**Ingredients** : Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate\n\n**Texture** : White color, pasty. Very thick, \\*very\\* silicone-y (it's silicone based.. So), chokes the skin, spreadability is good, doesn't require a lot of massaging in, quick dry time. Moderate - slightly high white cast. Makes my face sweat! \n\n**Fragrance** : No. Silicone like.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Definitely. Strong staying power. Survives sweating and water splashes too well. Requires double cleanse or a heavy duty face wash to remove. \n\n**Reapplication** : Hahaha! Go ahead and try it if you want to look like a freshly frosted cake! Don't even \\*think\\* about it. Unless you plan to scare people with your literal white walker look. Been there, done that. I'm forever terrified, and will \\*never\\* do it again.\n\n**Overall Experience** : It's a thick paste, Stings around the eyes, which was surprising it being a physical sunscreen (probably because the zinc is micronized? idk) Reapplication is painful, can't apply more than 2 pea sized amount in the first application. Attracts dirt, Chokes my pores, I can't afford to apply something so pore clogging and then strip my facial skin away to remove it.   \n For me, it's not worth the price performance wise.   \n I'm finishing it off as a primer for occasions, smoothes out the face surface, my face gleamed during diwali :P\n\n**Repurchase status** : Miss! **WNRP**.\n\n**5- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Mineral Sunscreen, SPF 50+ PA++++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹295 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹236)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Silica, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Sodium Chloride, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Perfume, Magnesium Sulphate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Thick cream. Low - medium effort required for blending in the skin. Doesn't move around a lot. Medium - High Dry time. Low white cast (for a mineral sunscreen), medium matte finish. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : No, doesn't survive low- medium sweating. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I haven't used this sunscreen much. My mom used it a few times, and the moment I saw it melting down her face I didn't want to use it. Could have been a great affordable mineral sunscreen, but it's not even mildly water resistant, so I instantly passed on it. Might give it a try in the future. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WNRP**. \n\n**6- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Sunblock and Anti Tan Lotion Tinted Sunscreen, SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 60 ml - ₹245 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water,Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Propylene Glycol, Glyceryl Monostearate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Kaolin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Sodium Sulfite, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Extract, Saxifraga Sarmentosa Extract, Acetyl Tyrosine, Arbutin, Glutathione, Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dimethiconol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, Perfume, Disodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ci 77492, Ci 77491, Ci 77499\n\n**Texture** : Orange color (literally). Medium consistency lotion like. Lightweight. Medium matte finish. Easy application. Doesn't require much effort to blend in. But the color is a literal disaster, it's impossible to apply a full finger length of this sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. On the Higher side. \n\n**Water Resistant** : Maybe a bit more than the mineral sunscreen variant? Not sure, rubs off on the mask \\*very\\* readily. Haven't noticed orange sweat yet, maybe because I haven't worn it enough. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. But I'm pretty sure it's not possible provided the intense color. \n\n**Overall Experience** : It could have been a good,  affordable tinted sunscreen, but the tint is just a disaster.. It dulls my face overall, and it doesn't even work as a bb cream (or sorts) although I don't expect to provide any coverage as per se (which it doesn't anyhow), but I can't find a way to finish it off other than applying it on my hands. Maybe color corrector?? Omg what'd I just come up with 😃💡. Let's see lol \n\n**Repurchase status** : Nope. **WNRP**. \n\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/RVccCB01/IMG-20211119-173651.jpg\n\n**7-** **Malibu LipCare Balm, SPF 30, UVA/UVB** (watermelon variant) \n\n**Quantity - Price** : 5 gm - ₹249-₹299\n\n(bought 2 on amazon for ₹199 each )\n\n**Ingredients** (watermelon) : Petrolatum, Paraffinum Liquidum (Mineral Oil), Paraffin Wax, Ozokerite Wax, Homosalate, Octocrylene, Carnauba Wax, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Flavor  \n May Contain: Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Citral, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol\n\n**Texture** : Ultra Rich, stiff stick, application is not smooth and breezy, tugs and pulls on the lips if you rush it, tightly press it against the surface, let the balm melt and glide on slowly. Makes lips very soft though. Staying power is great! \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Watermelon. Strong. \n\n**Taste** : Bitter Af! Avoid applying it on the insides and corners to keep it from seeping in. \n\n**Water resistant?** : Definitely! Survives liquids (tea, water, juice for me) not very heavy meals. Apply a thick layer to fight the mask rubbing off. Stays on for hours, afternoon - evening, for example. Keeps lips very soft and supple, no stinging sensation. \n\n**Overall Experience** : The only lip balm with spf 30 (plus uva/uvb protection) that has all the ingredients disclosed. Can't ask for more.   \n The only issue is, I can't use it with my waterproof /transferproof matte lipsticks. It makes them water loving and easily transferable, need to figure something out for that.. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : Unless I find some other lip balm with spf 30 mentioning all the ingredients, in a more affordable range, with no bitter taste, and better sunscreen filters. I **WRP** this. \n\nThats about it! Congrats for making it this far! Thanks!\n\n*Edited to add links to images, since I couldn't upload them with the post*",

    "body": "**TL;DR: Don't fuck up like me. Make sure your moisturizer, primer, and foundation all have the same base or you will regret it.** \n\nOk, I know that this topic has come up a lot recently, but I feel like a lot of discussions leave out a key part of the problem. By now, I think most people know that you have to make sure your primer and foundation have the same base i.e. are they water based or silicone based. It makes sense since those two are layered one on top of the other and if they're immiscible then the foundation will just settle on top and come off on everything, defeating the purpose of a primer. Now, what I haven't seen discussed is how your moisturizer may be interacting with your primer and foundation. I've discovered some interesting things through trial and error recently and wanted to share it with the MUA community.\n\nFirst, I recently switched moisturizers. My skin has been a disaster this winter and I needed a major skincare overhaul. I have sensitive skin and Neutrogena has always had my back with great products that don't irritate my skin. One of the new things I got was a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, the [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/hydro+boost+water+gel.do?sortby=ourPicks). I love this product because it absorbs quickly, eliminated my dry spots, and hasn't caused any irritation. What I didn't take into account when I bought this product was the ingredients list; I was just happy to find a non-irritating hyaluronic acid delivery system. \n\nwater, **dimethicone**, glycerin, **dimeticone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer**, phenoxyethanol, polyacrylamide, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, dimethiconol, C13-14 isoparaffin, **dimethicone crosspolymer**, chlorphenesin, carbomer, laureth-7, sodium hyaluronate, ethylhexylglycerin, fragrance, C12-14 pareth-12, sodium hydroxide, blue 1 \n\nThe bolded ingredients indicate it's a silicone-based primer. Yes, the first ingredient is water, but the silicone is present in large amounts, and it interacts differently with water-based products.\n\nMistake 1: I was going for a low-effort look one day and decided to used some of my face powder and call it good. With face powder I usually wear my [NYX HD Primer](http://www.nyxcosmetics.com/high-definition-primer/NYX_180.html) because it's lighter but still holds the powder in place. That day my makeup was slipping and sliding everywhere and I looked like a cakey hot mess when I got home. I checked the ingredients on my moisturizer, found all the silicone, then looked at the primer ingredients. \n\n**Water/Aqua/Eau,** Propylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Diethylhexyl Maleate, Glycerin, Ethylene/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Dimethicone, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, PEG-15 Glyceryl Isostearate, Trihydroxystearin, Adipic Acid/Neopentyl Glycol Crosspolymer, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Tocopheryl Acetate, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax/Cera Carnauba/Cire de Carnauba, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7, Silica, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin,  Propylene Glycol Stearate, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Laurate, Propylene Glycol Laurate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Butylene Glycol, Salicornia Herbacea Extract, Copper Tripeptide-1,  Chlorphenesin, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, VP/VA Copolymer, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, C12-14 Pareth-7, Amodimethicone,  Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance/Parfum, Citronellol, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. MAY CONTAIN / PEUT CONTENIR (+/-): Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Zinc Oxide (CI 77947), Chromium Hydroxide Green (CI 77289), Ultramarines (CI 77007).\n\nThe water-based primer just sat on top of my moisturizer, making my makeup come off all over everything.\n\nMistake 2: I somehow spaced and forgot all about my moisturizer issues and yesterday I was rushing to leave and decided to just throw on some Sonia Kashuk Radiant Tinted Moisturizer and go. Wrong move. I had already washed my face and moisturized previously, so the Neutrogena moisturizers was under the tinted moisturizer. As I was rubbing the tinted moisturizer on my face, it started to ball up and look disgusting. I quickly wiped it off and left bare faced, but later I looked at the ingredients in the Sonia Kashuk Tinted Moisturizer. \n\nFluorphlogopite, Sorbitan Is Os Tearate,\nTris Iloxane, D Is Teardimonium Hectorite,\nCetyl Peg/Ppg‐10/1 D Imethicone,\nD Imethicone Cros S Polymer, Butylene Glycol,\nSilica D Imethyl Silylate, Synthetic Bees Wax,\nTetras Odium Ed Ta, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium\nChloride, Alcohol, Talc, Peg‐30\nD Ipolyhydroxys Tearate, Aluminum\nHydroxide, Potas S Ium Sorbate, Stearic Acid,\nCaprylyl Methicone, As Corbyl Palmitate,\nTocopherol, Pentaerythrityl Tetra‐Di‐T‐Butyl\nHydroxyhydrocinnamate.\nMay Contain: Mica, Titanium D Ioxide, Iron\nOxides , Zinc Oxide.\n\nThis one is a little more tricky, as it does have some dimethicone ingredients, but my best guess is that the other ingredients react negatively with the ingredients in the Neutrogena moisturizer.\n \nNow, I know this sounds like using the Neutrogena moisturizer is too much of a pain, but it's really not that big of a deal. My favorite primer, the [ELF Poreless Face Primer](http://www.elfcosmetics.com/p/poreless-face-primer?dept=face-faceprimer), works perfectly with this moisturizer and my HG foundation, [Revlon Colorstay Whipped](http://www.revlon.com/products/face/foundation-makeup/revlon-colorstay-whipped-creme-makeup#309971347054||0), goes on better than ever. I just wanted to make this post to inform people that mismatched moisturizer can cause just as many issues as mismatched primer and foundation!",

I finally found a moisturizer that works, CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion, which I think is water based? But my NYX photo-loving primer for anti-redness, Make Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation and the other foundation I like (CoverGirl 3-in-1 Outlast) are all silicone based if I'm reading the ingredients correctly.

I may or may not have been keeping a weather eye on upcoming SPF releases ever since Director Ahn In-Sook mentioned in passing in a video that many cosmeceutical brands have either put a stopper on releasing new sunscreens or postponed the release of those awaiting completion to better the formula and ensure they're up to snuff, thus there will be a slew of SPF releases come March. ~~Heaven forfend we suffer the wrath of deadly solar lasers cuz finding The One is nothing short of a bluidy struggle.~~\n\nWhat I've noted in these new releases was a combination of robust formulas and new filters. *Exciting!* I've already translated the INCI lists and entered them into Incidecoder & Cosdna.

I'm pretty sure these are all  the same base sunscreen with the same protection. I would get the sunscreen with the simplest ingredient list and whichever one is cheapest. The About Me Be Clean seems to be alcohol and fragrance-free (non sure if rosemary leaf oil is an essential oil and fragrant??). I would probably go with the Innifree though because I prefer alcohol in my sunscreen, otherwise they are too too dewy and greasy looking, and the ingredient list is rather simple. If only it didn't have fragrance, but I can compromise with that. The Dr. G has too many unnecessary ingredients and many comedogenic ingredients like myristic acid, so I would stay away from it.",

Although in reality, the dimethiconol mostly gets rinsed away too.\n\nIn the conditioner, the ingredients that are having the greatest impact include the Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Dimethiconol/Silsesquioxane Copolymer, and Behentrimonium Chloride.\n\nThese are all ingredients you can find in other formulas. \n\nThe idea that the smoothing performance is unlike anything on the market is debatable. There are likely lots of products that can give you the smoothing effect of these products. However, using a combination of very good formulas (these are), an appealing fragrance, and solid marketing, you can come to believe it is the best you've ever used.  Just know that you haven't used everything and there are lots of products that you would be happy with if only you could test them on a blinded basis.",

    "body": "**CoTZ Sunscreen Review (Part One?)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ogkbnjalmbc51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74541de92caf8a4ccb74b007f922509d62a1848b\n\nWell hey there!\n\nAfter striking out with a number of Supergoop! face sunscreens (more reviews coming soon)…I decided to incorporate a new brand into my routine in hopes to give my skin a chance to recover. I really dove into ‘Best Mineral Sunscreens For Dark Skin” videos/posts and ended up purchasing a number of recommendations. The CoTZ Flawless Complexion Tinted Sunscreen came up a few times. So, I grabbed that along with their Sensitive Non-Tinted Sunscreen.\n\nBoth products are 100% mineral based sunscreens with 20% Zinc Oxide as the UV protector. The tinted version contains Mica and Iron Oxides for color but outside of that the formulations are nearly identical. Various silicones, preservatives, and texturizes make the list for both products.\n\nCoTZ focuses on mineral based sunscreens that are relatively “clean” and suitable for sensitive skin. No dyes, fragrance, or essential oils are here which is nice to see (and a nice change from the potpourri bowl that is Supergoop!). The brand name itself stands for Contains Only Titanium Zinc…a nod to the focus on physical SPF.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/er2a827mmbc51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=03a682918bc1a5e6fca56553c0f80811ed71ed0c\n\nBoth sunscreens have a rather thick/creamy texture that in turn applies a bit heavy as well. But, this heaviness absorbs down within a couple of minutes with a “residue” that I don’t have an issue with. Those that have kept up with my reviews (LOL) know that I really like that K-Beauty glow/near shiny look. These sunscreens from CoTZ provide that for sure without being greasy (for me).\n\nBut aside from the application and feel…the white cast (or lack of) from these mineral sunscreens is really what sets them apart. The very minimal white cast from the non-tinted version and the total lack of white cast from the tinted is something I have not experienced from a Zinc Oxide based product before. Seriously…I was ready to grab every other SPF in my stash and give it all away. “This is all I need for the rest of my life!” I thought LOL!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qm8hmunmbc51.jpg?width=2316&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0981a2fd35f82b034386bb64e24973b9264ef8d\n\nThe Sensitive Non-Tinted Sunscreen does start to show its mineral roots after a few layers throughout the day (especially when exercising/sweating). But still, the white cast is minimal compared to other products I have used. As for the Flawless Complexion Tinted Sunscreen…I could just layer and layer that stuff on. I think this particular tint is just a really, really good match to my skin tone. It totally masks any white cast and disappears into my skin. CoTZ isn’t kidding with their “Vanishing Zinc Oxide” marketing.\n\nI won’t throw out my other sunscreens just yet LOL…and will keep testing/reviewing mineral sunscreens from brands like Australian Gold, Elta MD, and Versed. Hopefully there will be some more winners in the bunch but for now I am happy to say I have found my new favorite sunscreen brand. The tinted version would be my overall go-to but with the tint liking to transfer to my face masks…I find myself reaching for the non-tinted version just as often.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jwzwmadpmbc51.jpg?width=2316&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a59f1d13f6e5e23331ac0775bed47c48cfe860b\n\nHonestly, I think anyone who has struggled with finding a decent mineral sunscreen should give these a try. My only hesitations in recommending them would be if you have particularly oily skin, need something that can stand up to a good workout, or really prefer a matte finish SPF. These two products will range from dewy to rather heavy depending on your skin type and neither really “dry-down” all the way. CoTZ makes some primer/matte style sunscreens and I am tempted to give them a go.\n\nI’m so happy to have stumbled across these two sunscreens as they were a much needed reprieve from Supergoop! (not everything has been a miss so far from that brand…but most everything LOL). Part of me wishes I would have invested in the entire CoTZ product range and reviewed that vs. Supergoop!…ah well.\n\nNeedless to say I’ll be keeping a couple of bottles of CoTZ sunscreens in my stash going forward. \n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nSensitive Skin Non-Tinted Sunscreen: **Active Ingredients:** Zinc Oxide 20% **Purpose:** Sunscreen **Inactive Ingredients:** C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Cetyl PEG/PPG 10/1 Dimethicone, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Disodium EDTA, Glycerin, Hydrogen Dimethicone, Microcrystalline Wax, PEG-10 Dimethicone, PEG-30 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Chloride, Stearyl Dimethicone, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Water\n\nFlawless Complexion Tinted Sunscreen: **Active Ingredients:** Zinc Oxide 20% **Purpose:** Sunscreen **Inactive Ingredients:** Bismuth Oxychloride, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Cetyl PEG/PPG 10/1 Dimethicone, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Disodium EDTA, Glycerin, Hydrogen Dimethicone, Iron Oxides, Mica, Microcrystalline Wax, PEG-10 Dimethicone, PEG-30 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Chloride, Stearyl Dimethicone, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Water\n\nWhere To Buy (Link To CoTZ Site - Prices Vary Depending On Product/Size): [https://cotzskincare.com/mineral-sunscreens/](https://cotzskincare.com/mineral-sunscreens/)",

Still probably way higher than most other brands).\n\nThough with these products in general, particularly for the ones with “real” (not pseudo/ceramide precursors), honestly I would be shocked if they were present at more than 0.1 %. Even if they come before the preservatives, the preservatives are probably present at like 0.9% so the company can list them after the fancy ingredients even though the expensive ingredients are at minuscule concentrations. Maybe I’m too cynical, but a >1% concentration of any ceramides would be such a HUGE selling point (not to mention very expensive to produce) that I can’t believe they’re not advertising it\n\nLike Regimen is coming out with one and they are trumpeting the HELL out of it (and I mean fair enough)",

    "body": "Hello folks! So my Physicians Formula booster and Olay Luminous booster came in the mail today!\n\nI'm just really excited to share because I searched HIGH AND LOW for affordable niacinamide products that have a high % of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLINK TO MY PICTURES:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/7ab5NZ8](https://imgur.com/a/7ab5NZ8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe PF I have not used before. But it's the FIRST affordable product that I came across that has high % of niacinamide AND  Acetyl glucosamine ---- not just those, but a small amount of supposedly the most powerful vitamin c derivative!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Niacinamide and NAG work synergistically together](https://lotioncrafter.com/products/n-acetyl-glucosamine-nag) to be a brightening powerhouse as well as repairing your skin barrier. They help boost your ceramide production and NAG is skin-identical.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**PHYSICIANS FORMULA SKIN BOOSTER - BRIGHTENING**](https://www.target.com/p/physicians-formula-skin-booster-vitamin-shot-brightening-1-fl-oz/-/A-75569193)  **$7.99/1 oz or 30ml**\n\n*Water, Butylene Glycol,* ***Niacinamide***\\*, Glycerin,\\* ***Acetyl Glucosamine***\\*, Pentylene Glycol, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Disodium Edta, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Phenylethyl Resorcinol, Caesalpinia Spinosa Fruit Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Sodium Benzotriazolyl Butylphenol Sulfonate,\\* ***3-0-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid***\\*, Iron Oxides (Ci 77492), Tocopheryl Acetate, Phenoxyethanol, Vegetable Collagen, Agar, Calcium Alginate, Xanthan Gum, Kappaphycus Alvarezii Extract, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tropolone, Gluconolactone, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cynara Scolymus (Artichoke) Leaf Extract, Red 30 (Ci 73360), Sodium Benzoate.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like it's an \"inspired\" product of [**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**](https://www.paulaschoice.com/10pct-niacinamide-booster/798.html)**:**\n\n*Water (Aqua),* ***Niacinamide*** *(vitamin B3, skin-restoring ),* ***Acetyl Glucosamine*** *(skin replenishing/antioxidant),* ***Ascorbyl Glucoside*** *(vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative).*\n\nThe Paula's Choice obviously has more beneficial ingredients and higher % but still, it's **$44 for 0.67oz/20ml**.

Probably because Olay developed it. But it works great on its own as a brightener, and even better combined with vitamin c (which is why you see ascorbyl glucoside here, a stable derivative of ascorbic acid). The miracle boost USED to contain n-acetyl glucosamine (which is the one I used) as well the other ones listed here. But I guess it got too expensive or whatever.\n\nThis also has some other great ingredients, like xylitol, gylcerin, panthenol, zinc and copper gluconate for soothing and healing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used this booster in conjunction with the Luminous cream, which has niacinamide and NAG. My skin looked so much brighter and prettier. The texture was really smoothed out and my skin started getting a more like.. translucent ?? quality? You DO need to give brightening ingredients *at least 3 months* to work their magic though, especially for things like arbutin/hydroquinone. (Arbutin breaks down into hydroquinone.) But for niacinamide, I saw results for skin texture/overall brightening before that.\n\nI honestly couldn't believe the price Target was selling it for, because I got it for a much higher price elsewhere before. I couldn't keep affording it so I let it go, sadly. :'(\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe [**Luminous Tone Perfecting Treatment ($24.99)**](https://www.olay.com/en-us/skin-care-products/regenerist-luminous-tone-perfecting-treatment) is a simpler formula, but still has the same active ingredients.\n\n*Water,* ***Niacinamide\\*****, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Dimethicone,* ***Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine***\\*, Silica, Boron Nitride,\\* ***Ascorbyl Glucoside***\\*, Polyglyceryl-2 Oleate, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Dimethiconol, Aminomethyl Propanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Oleate, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium EDTA, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, \\*Vitamin B3\\*\n\nBut ironically, it costs more than the more complex booster if you purchase at Target online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DIY:**\n\nI have made DIY niacinamide NAG serums before. But because I'm too lazy to make it properly, they really lack penetration power. I'm really into cosmetic science and have read from professional cosmetic chemists that a simple DIY isn't effective if you don't do it right. You gotta keep the powders dissolved right and STAY dissolved instead of them recrystallizing on your skin and not penetrating your skin/being useless. I experimented for months with the DIY but I DEFINITELY noticed a difference as soon as I started using well-formulated, commercially available niacinamide serums.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy personal experience with certain products:\n\n\\- [**Eva Naturals 5% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-Niacinamide-Serum-Eva-Naturals/dp/B0147PDMYY/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=eva+naturals+niacinamide&amp;qid=1561763684&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3)**:** Pretty awesome, works well, you get 2 oz. But it has avocado oil and such, and may break some people out. (This is definitely a private-label product and you can find the same exact formula for cheaper on DIY sites - which is why you see like 324982394 bottles of the same formula of everything from niacinamide to vitamin c serums on amazon.) I get the same sort of overall brightening and translucency I get with Olay. Better results with my other products, Benton 0.5% salicylic acid (very gentle) aloe BHA toner, Purito green level centella buffet serum (also has niacinamide, like 2%), and Naturie Hatomugi gel essence. Bright, translucent skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Cerave PM:** Supposedly has 4% niacinamide. Loved this as a lightweight moisturizer, but did NOT see the results I got with other niacinamide products. Makes me feel skeptical. Or perhaps there's a pretty big difference for my skin with 4% and 5%. I doubt it, but you know. Maybe it's just cuz it's formulated for skin-replenishing and not for brightening. But you'd think same ingredient will have same effects, y'know?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Skinlex 10% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.skinlex.com/product/10-niacinamide-serum-60ml/)**:** Ingredient list looks GREAT and some others seem to love it, but I saw absolutely zero niacinamide benefits for my skin. Penetration issue?\n\nI have other products I've used with niacinamide, but these are the main ones I can remember on the top of my head. La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+ baume has it as well, but I do not know the %. Very good moisturizer for the body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther commercial products you can find SEPIWHITE in:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Black Opal skin care products**](https://blackopalbeauty.com/collections/skincare): They have multiple.

I used to use Neutrogena oil free moisturizer for combination skin before and it was quite decent but my face would feel sticky after a while and it's kinda uncomfortable. I tried Suganda white lotus moisturiser and it made my skin very sticky and oily within an hour. \nI tried Earth Rhythm phytogel and it was nice, decent like a light weight aloe Vera gel but not worth the price imo. So I was always on a hunt for a good gel type moisturiser that just didn't make me oily or feel tacky. \nI didn't want to spend 950 bucks to try this hydroboost moisturiser so I was always hesitant till one day I found a trial size available for 370 and decided to look past the fragrance and give it a go. \n\nThe first day I used it on dry skin after washing my face and it felt just okay and after a bit it started feeling tight and weird. I thought since it has Hyaluronic acid I should use it on damp skin. \n\nSo the next day I used it on damp skin and it felt way better but still it was just okay, nothing too crazy. Meh. \n\nThe third day I tried the moisture sandwich technique, something I've seen James Welsh do many times. \nSo I wash my face, wiped off the excess dripping water with my hand so that it's still damp, applied this moisturiser on my damp face and then sprayed rosewater on top of it. \nFelt quite crazy doing it the first time ngl but it was totally worth it. \nI didn't wash my face for the next 12 hours and I could not believe that my face was not oily at all. Maybe after 8-9 hours it was very slightly oily around my nose but it's nothing compared to how oily and greasy I would get within 2 hours after using other moisturiser. \nI observed the same results after doing this at night and waking up the next morning to a non greasy face. \nI also feel like with this moisturiser the way of application matters a lot and I only get this result when I apply in this way. \n\nThe small tub lasted me a month after using it twice a day everyday. It definitely lives up to all the claims made. \nMy skin feels healthy, supple and so balanced. I felt so happy when I randomly touched my face during the day and it was NOT tacky or greasy or matte even, just felt like normal healthy skin. \nIt does have fragrance but it does not bother me, I'm okay with it. \nIt did not break me out at all. \nI hate that I love this moisturiser so much and really want to save up to buy the big tub lol.",

I had completely clear skin and one day was baffled to witness small open pores allover. It took some time to realise it's because of this. Apply it at night always woke up with a redddish eye. My friends to found it's building up acne in them. We really thought of filing a case on this. We feel cheated, even the brand suggests that if ur doctor recommends it and u get side effects , remember it's because it's doing good on ur skin...this is the caption of the product..something like this. May I remind u all that this is johnson and johnson company who have absolutely no ethics nor science backedup . It's proven that their products do cause cancer. This company is hell bent in exploiting indian market because our laws are not stringent. Be very very cautious",

Sometimes actives are not what your skin is looking for and a good moisturiser can be the game-changer.*\n\n[Just a pic](https://preview.redd.it/p39fzjc4kx661.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=027cc219d95e8947525507a3beec33a9d459f961)\n\nBefore I review the products, these are my expectations from my moisturiser.\n\n1. ***Hydrate:*** Bring water/moisture to my skin\n2. ***Emolliate:*** Thanks to kindofstephen (google his blog or insta if you haven't) for providing a term to my feelings. Make my skin soft and supple by nourishing my stratum corneum with nourishing lipids without clogging my pores.\n3. ***Strengthen my barrier:*** To reduce TEWL by strengthening my barrier so that my skin stays hydrated and supple for longer. This also means I want the moisturiser to have slight occlusive properties.\n4. ***Repair:*** To help my damaged/sensitised skin by repairing my skin barrier.\n5. ***Extras/added benefits:*** Would like if the moisturiser additionally helps to deliver certain ingredients that help with targetted issues like ageing, hyperpigmentation etc. This is not a must though.\n\n\\---\n\n***1. Avene Skin Recover Cream -*** ₹*1500 (depends on discounts); Cost Per gm: ₹30/gm*\n\nThis is my go-to skin-emergency product. I do not use it on daily basis. The texture is cloudlike but not mousse-y. It is a lightweight cream. Nevertheless, it packs a punch. I have gone through 8+ tubes of this stuff. It is the only cream that does not aggravate any sensitised areas (burning/redness/dry patches/peeling patches) and absolutely calms my skin. This cream is true to its name. Repairs compromised flaking, sensitised skin in two days with twice/thrice a day usage. The ingredient list is very minimalistic. It is expensive and the sterile patented packaging kind of sucks because you will most definitely have face squirts if you are not careful. However, I can rely on this cream to fix my skin mistakes.\n\n* Hydrate: 4/5\n* Emmoliate: 4/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 4.5/5\n* Extras: 0/5\n* Status: HG, It is easily available in India but shit is expensive.\n\n***Perfect for: All skin types, Sensitive skin***\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene Aqua), Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Squalane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Serine, Carbomer, Tetrasodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, Water (Aqua)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***2. Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream -*** *$10/* ₹*1300 (with shipping/customs); Cost per gm* ₹6.5/gm\n\nI tried this product a month back and I am in love. This cream is perfectly balanced. It adequately hydrates and emolliates my skin. My skin feels supple and bouncy without being too greasy and the moisture lasts. I did not see noticeable calming benefits but as a moisturiser it is lovely. The tube is huge and a little goes a long way. This has a slight cooling effect when applied to the skin. Also uses a patented encapsulation delivery mechanism to delivery pseudo-ceramides (lab-made) which help to strengthen your skin barrier. In short, it is a simple no frill moisturiser that is easy to use - not too thick, not too thin, not too heavy, not too light, doesn't sensitize, not too silicone-y, doesn't pill, value for money.\n\n* Hydrate: 4/5\n* Emmoliate: 4/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 3.5/5\n* Extras: 0/5\n* Status: will repurchase.\n\n***Perfect for: All skin types***\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Stearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Palmitic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide Mea, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Magnolia Biondii Flower Extract, Cholesterol, Perilla Ocymoides Seed Extract, Lactobacillus/​Soybean Ferment Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohols, Glyceryl Caprylate, Dimethiconol, Mannitol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Silica, Arachidyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Alcohol, Acrylates/​Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polysorbate 20, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Propanediol*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***3. Eucerin Q10 Anti Wrinkle Face Cream -*** *$9*\n\nThis is my third tub of this cream. This cream is richer than any cream in the lot. It has a thick emollient texture without being too greasy. It absorbs easily in the skin. It also contains shea butter, SAP and Ubiquinone (Q10). This cream has helped me transition into tretinoin. Do not recommend it for day time use (especially in summers) but for night time/winters it is perfect. It keeps my face moisturised through the night and it has a soft blurring effect on fine lines/skin texture. It did not sensitize peeling skin but helped repair my barrier. I use this regularly at night and it helped to fix the acute dryness that comes with tretinoin. I use it around my eyes and it hasn't given me milia/ clogged my pores. My mom loves and swears by it. She finds it makes her wrinkles look softer.\n\n* Hydrate: 3.5/5\n* Emmoliate: 4.5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 4/5\n* Extras: 3/5\n* Status: HG but not readily available in India. Will stock up when relatives come post covid.\n\n***Perfect for:*** *Combo-dehydrated/Dry/ Mature skin*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Cocoate, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Stearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Octyldodecanol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ubiquinone, Biotin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Zea Mays (Corn) Oil, Beta-Carotene, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Trisodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Phenoxyethanol*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***4. Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume -*** ₹*1300 (with shipping/customs); Cost per gm* ₹6.5/gm\n\nThis cream is unique. As the name suggests it is a cream-balm hybrid but the texture is surprisingly lightweight. Highly emollient with occlusive properties. It absorbs quickly into the skin as the texture is not too heavy. Sadly, it leaves a greasy feeling/film on my skin. I can not use it the day time and worry that it will clog my pores if I use it on my face. I love it for the body especially my Sahara hands. It seriously brings life to my hands and I do not need to reapply often. I did notice a calming effect. Many of my friends from the community love to use it on their face. It is a little too heavy for my face. If your face is very dry, I think you may like this.\n\n* Hydrate: 3/5\n* Emmoliate: 5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 3.5/5\n* Extras: 0\n* Status: WNRP at least for my face.\n\n***Perfect for:***  *Extremely Dry Skin*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Aqua/​Water/​Eau, Glycerin, Paraffinum Liquidum /​ Mineral Oil /​ Huile Minerale, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Behenyl Alcohol, Sucrose Stearate, Canola /​ Canola Oil /​ Huile De Colza, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Pentylene Glycol, Beta-Sitosterol, Xylitol, Zinc Gluconate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Palmitamide Mea, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Rhamnose, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 60, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Phytosphingosine, Ceramide Np, Mannitol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide Ap, Cholesterol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Ceramide EOP*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***5. Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream -*** ₹2700 *(estimated); Cost per gm* ₹45/gm\n\nI was sort of disappointed with this product. It is not a bad product but it is not necessarily better. The soft blue colour deceives your mind to think the cream texture may be light. It is actually slightly thick with a silicone-y feel. It has a cooling effect on the skin when you first apply it which tricks the calming feeling. While it is hydrating when you first apply it but compared to others I feel the moisture does not last as long. Also, it makes the sensitised area skin sort of burn. The feeling is not intense but very much against claims. I did not notice any calming/repairing benefits. It may also not be enough moisturisation for the winters. The colour is aesthetically pleasing and silicone-y texture + cooling feel can outwit you into enjoying application but I do not see many real benefits.\n\n* Hydrate: 3/5\n* Emmoliate: 2.5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 3/5\n* Repair: 3/5\n* Extras: 1?\n* Status: WNRP, Expensive.\n\n***Perfect for:***  *Oily/ Combo Dehydrated Skin?*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Centella Asiatica Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Glyceryl Stearate, Stearic Acid, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Polysorbate 60, Bees Wax, Chlorphenesin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Morus Alba Root Extract, Tromethamine, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Guaiazulene, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Lecithin, Acetyl Glutamine, SH-Oligopeptide-1, SH-Oligopeptide-2, SH-Polypeptide-1, SH-Polypeptide-9, SH-Polypeptide-11, Bacillus/​Soybean/​Folic Acid Ferment Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol*\n\n&#x200B;",

These are all silicones you'd want to avoid:\n \n* Cetearyl Methicone\n\n* Cetyl Dimethicone\n\n* Dimethicone\n\n* Dimethiconol\n\n* Stearyl Dimethicone\n \n* Amodimethicone\n\n* Cyclomethicone/Cyclopentasiloxane\n\n* Trimethylsilylamodimethicone\n\nNot so hard, right? So now lets take a look at some oils/waxes that are generally frowned upon.\n\nHere is a list of waxes and non-natural oils to avoid:\n\n* Castor oil\n\n* Mineral oil (parrifidium liquidium)\n\n* Petrolatum\n\n* Waxes: bees wax, candelia wax, etc.\n\nSo when you've got a product in your hand, you now know what to look for when you're wanting to avoiding buildup.\n\nFor sulfates, there really isn't a cheat sheet, other than looking up the ingredients and comparing to your product of choice.\n\nHere is a list of sulfates to avoid:\n\n* Alkylbenzene sulfonates\n\n* Alkyl Benzene Sulfonate\n\n* Ammonium laureth sulfate\n\n* Ammonium lauryl sulfate\n\n* Ammonium Xylenesulfonate\n\n* Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate\n\n* Sodium cocoyl sarcosinate\n\n* Sodium laureth sulfate\n\n* Sodium lauryl sulfate\n\n* Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n\n* Sodium myreth sulfate\n\n* Sodium Xylenesulfonate\n\n* TEA-dodecylbenzenesulfonate\n\n* Ethyl PEG-15 cocamine sulfate\n\n* Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate\n\nI hope this helps.

    "body": "Hey ScA! I recently lapsed on my skincare routine, so I decided that I should do a review of my main products as I add them back into my routine. This review will be mainly overall experience, with some recent insights. I have more products that I have used in the past, but I decided to only review ones I have a lot of experience with so far. The only product I don't have reviewed from my routine is the Advanced Retinoid - as I just reintroduced that back into my routine in the last week.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**My current routine:**\n\n*AM*\n\n1.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n2.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n3.\tTO Niacinamide over whole face\n4.\tApply TO Caffeine to under eye\n5.\tFormula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free moisturizer over whole face\n6.\tIf using sunscreen, use Etude House Sunprise\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*PM*\n\n1.\tIf wearing makeup, I use baby oil to remove\n2.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n3.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n4.\tPaula’s Choice 2% BHA Gel to whole face – wait ~20 mins to sink in\n5.\tTO Retinoid Advanced Retinoid 2% over whole face\n6.\tMoisturize with Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Info about my skin/general experience trying out products:**\n\n* VERY oily t-zone, normal cheeks, normal-to-dry jaw line and around mouth; light-to-medium skin tone\n* VERY VERY CC-prone, mainly on my forehead (some on chin). This is mainly due to not being consistent with my routine (especially simply washing my face with a cleanser, which is the minimum I need). This can also occur from moisturizer.\n* No issues with acne, except a few whiteheads around my menstrual cycle\n* Most cleansers I have tried are either a) not strong enough or b) too strong\n* Main skin concerns: Oil control, reducing appearance of giant nose pores, preventing CCs, even skin tone, healthy aging\n* Slowly trying to reduce the number of products I use for all the things (not just skin care) that contain fragrances\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser](https://imgur.com/a/uAvebDj)\n\n***Product Type:*** Cleanser; specifically purchased because it is **sulfate free** (my body hates sulfates)\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Juice, Coco-Betaine, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Peg-50 Shea Butter, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Lycium Barbarum Fruit Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Morinda Citrifolia Fruit Extract, Punica Granatum Juice Extract, Garcinia Mangostana Fruit Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Benzoic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Red 33\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance free**; **Sulfate free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; AM: use with konjac sponge; Fragrance is actually pleasant, doesn’t linger; consistency starts off creamy, but foams very easily\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is amazing, and has been a major game-changer for me when it comes to cleansers. I’ve never found a cleanser that worked long-term before this one. A little goes a long way with this stuff – it is a very efficient clean. My face feels so soft afterwards. While it is strong enough to get rid of all my oil, it’s not so harsh that it makes my skin tight.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** In terms of function, none that I can think of. Only downfall (IMO) is it is not fragrance-free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4.5/5 stars, I’ve gone through over 4-5 bottles of this stuff and I will keep it in rotation until I can find a functionally similar product that is fragrance-free\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Thayer’s Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner](https://imgur.com/a/OwCREGs)\n\n***Product Type:*** Toner; purchased because of how many people liked it on ScA\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~0.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Purified Water, Certified Organic Witch Hazel Ext Blend (Hamamelis Virginiana Extract (Witch Hazel*), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (Filet of Aloe Vera*)), Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Water, Fragrance (Natural Rose), Citric Acid, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Seed Extract\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** ***Not fragrance-free***; Liquid consistency; potentially irritating, depending on your skins relationship with witch hazel\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Despite the smell (see below), this stuff works pretty well. I always feel like this enhances my *clean* feel following my cleanse, but it also leaves my skin feeling refreshed and moisturized. I always follow-up with moisturizer, but I can definitely tell when I don’t use it, especially in my dry areas.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** **I HATE THE SMELL OF THIS STUFF!** Come to find out, I hate the smell of roses (I’m weird, I know…) but seriously. This stuff smells like a rose pooped in some water and then sold it on the side of the road on a hot sunny day. It’s terrible. If you are remotely disinterested in the smell of rose, do not buy this.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5 due to smell. Will repurchase the fragrance-free version in the future\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%](https://imgur.com/a/Tuo5otO)\n\n***Product Type:*** Purchased to reduce redness/even skin tone and to control oil; side-benefits: helps prevent CCs\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mild medicinal smell**, doesn’t linger; Somewhat-sticky consistency; Absorbs quickly\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** I keep this in rotation mainly because it helps control my oil. Even if I use this stuff without my mattifying moisturizer, it helps prevent the massive amounts of oil that my skin normally produces. It helps keep my skin an even texture and tone, as well. I’m not 100% sure if this is solely responsible for preventing my CC (doubt it, since I use BHA), but I’m almost certain it’s contributing at the least. This product has been one that I have been most consistent with besides my cleanser and what little redness I sometimes develop (mainly due to allergies or weather) has been under control.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Functionally, none. This stuff does what it’s supposed to. I just hate the dropper packaging, personally, of most TO products. It’s hard to get the little bits out of the bottom!!\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, have repurchased 2+ times; will be replacing with skinlex’s version to avoid buying more products from Deciem.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG](https://imgur.com/a/roT93Vy)\n\n***Product Type:*** Active for reducing appearance of eye contour pigmentation\n\n***Cost:*** **$* - ~$7.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Caffeine, Maltodextrin, Glycerin, Propanediol, Epigallocatechin Gallatyl Glucoside, Gallyl Glucoside, Hyaluronic Acid, Oxidized Glutathione, Melanin, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Urea, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Xanthan gum, Lactic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Propyl Gallate, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Benzyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; Watery-to-thick consistency (from the glycerin, probably); no noticeable smell; yellow-ish in color\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I’ve been using this stuff for a little over a year, and honestly it does absolutely nothing for my eye contour. I don’t have much puffiness, but I do have decent enough under eye darkness where I wanted something to help. This does not. It does help reduce the appearance with some small, visible blood vessels around my nose, but it’s only a temporary effect thereby reducing redness. \n\n***Bad stuff:*** It doesn’t really work for what I wanted it to work for.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 1/5, WNRP.\n\n*Does anyone have any suggestions of what I can do with what I have leftover? I’d love to use it for something else if it’s functional!*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free Mattifying Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/rQeCSUV)\n\n***Product Type:*** Daytime moisturizer; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Propylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethicone, Ceteareth-20, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Silica Silylate, Behenyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Salicylic Acid, Panthenol, Fragrance, Boron Nitride, Bambusa Arundinacea (Bamboo) Stem Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Maltodextrin, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance-free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; very thick consistency; absorbs quickly; powdery/soft finish\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** Another game-changer with my oily skin. Using this moisturizer during the day saves my face from producing oil. Even if I sweat a little bit, it controls oil. Normally, without it, I’ll start producing oil within a few hours of cleansing. If I use this moisturizer, I’m relatively oil-free all day, except around my nostrils. This is also a strong enough moisturizer to keep my dryness at bay, even during the wintertime (and where I live gets very cold during the winter).\n\n***Bad stuff:*** The smell is pretty bad (probably the bamboo), but honestly I get used to it and the smell goes away quickly. My friend said it smells like wet dog... haha but I don't notice it anymore since I've been using it for so long.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, only because it’s not fragrance-free. Will continue to repurchase until I can find a fragrance-free alternative.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Sun Milk SPF50+/PA+++](https://imgur.com/a/kXZLXCa)\n\n***Product Type:*** Sunscreen; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.40 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dipropylene Glycol, Titanium Dioxide, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Viscum Album (Mistletoe) Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Carex Humillis Root Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Pinus Sylvestris Leaf Oil, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Malpighia Emarginata (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Echium Plantagineum Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Peg-10 Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Magnesium Sulfate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Methicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Aluminum Hydroxide, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Octyldodecanol, Dimethicone, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-6 Polyricinoleate, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Butylene Glycol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Cellulose Gum\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mineral sunscreen**; **Not fragrance-free**; **Mild whitecast**, but absorbs well; **Drying**; mattifying/oil-control like a boss; pleasant scent; not waterproof\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Due to drying my skin out, I only use this product when I have to. I don’t wear SPF most days (work inside, very little exposure to sun during the day), but I do wear this when I’m running errands and/or trying to control my oil more than I can with the moisturizer mentioned previously. This stuff works really well to control oil – the best of any product I’ve tried so far. Wears well under makeup, as long as my dry skin is kept controlled. Some minor white cast, but with my skin it absorbs and isn’t visible (even when I’m tanner) – but may not be the same on someone with a darker than medium skin tone.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** This product is very drying. It works SO WELL on controlling oil, but it zaps any amount of moisture out of my dry spots. To the point where I have to counteract the dryness in my PM routine. Do not recommend for people with sensitive skin, or dry skin.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 3/5, due to drying and not being fragrance-free; Will continue to repurchase until I find an alternative that controls my oil as well as this does, if ever.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Paula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Gel Exfoliant](https://imgur.com/a/X9YEexN)\n\n***Product Type:*** Chemical exfoliant; meant to prevent/reduce CCs and help with overall skin texture\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$8.80 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, (hydration), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Phytosphingosine (skin-renewing), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Vitis Vinifera Seed Extract (grape extract/antioxidant), Camellia Sinensis Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (green tea/antioxidant) Epilobium Angustifolium Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (willow herb/skin-soothing), Bisabolol (skin-soothing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH-adjusting), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; **BHA**; thick consistency, absorbs slowly\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is AMAZING! It attacks any signs of CCs overnight, and can easily clear my CC-prone forehead within a day or two. I use it almost every day as a preventative. My face has been noticeably clearer and smoother thanks to this product. Also, it visibly reduces the appearances of pores - this combined with the retinol I use has been an amazing in reducing their appearance.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Smells chemical, so may be off-putting to some people. Absorbs slowly, so you should leave room in your routine for that.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, WRP. I am going to be trying to the liquid version (I got it on sale), but if this works better for me over the liquid I will come back to it\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/BDGVfpd)\n\n***Product Type:*** PM moisturizer; light-weight\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$9.50 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Dimethicone/vinyl Dimenticone Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethaqnol, Polyacrylamide, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Dimethiconol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, C12-14 Pareth -12, Sodium Hydroxide, Blue 1\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **NOT Fragrance-free**; **Contains silicones**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; **Contains hyaluronic acid**; Very light-weight moisturizer.\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I love this product. It was the first moisturizer I tried when I embarked on my skincare journey, and I am so thankful I found it. This is the first moisturizer I used every in my life that didn’t break me out or lead to a forehead full of CCs. I’m in love with this stuff! It is light enough for my super oily spots (which is not due to being dry, it’s just oily…) and is strong enough for my dry spots. In the winter I use a little extra HA serum over my whole face and it works like a charm. I’ve been dabbling with some oils as well, but so far I haven’t found it necessary in the summer because this moisturizer works so well!\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Nothing, just that it’s not fragrance free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, because of fragrance. Will continue to RP until I can find an alternative that I can afford and is fragrance free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading, everyone! I hope this is helpful, as I use some products that you don't see a lot around here (as well as some you do...). This is definitely a more simplified version of my routine, but that may be a good thing, as I'm noticing the same effects as to what I was seeing before despite reducing the number of products I use!",

    "body": "**Review (Long Term Usage; 1+ years)** I have been using a few CeraVe products for more than an year. Putting down all the reviews at one place.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/21mqpuxa4p7c1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6152cd7496bcfdc6354819d50cab1872dd769b28\n\n**About me**: 25 F; I have combination skin with an oily T zone in summers and dry cheeks and nose in winters. I don't like strong fragrance in products, and I stay away from DIYs\n\n**Skin concerns**: Cystic acne; scars, hyperpigmentation *and* *crying* from the cystic acne\n\nAccording to the brand, All CeraVe products are formulated to be fragrance-free.\n\n*Category 1: Cleansers*\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cream-to-Foam Cleanser**\n\nTexture: Just like its described. It’s a creamy lotion texture out of the bottle. When you add water to it, it foams up and washes off like any other foaming cleanser. No noticeable fragrance.\n\nApplication: I use it two ways. First, if I want to take off any light makeup I rub it all over my dry face and it melts makeup off, then I add water it it and cleanse. Second way, I use it as a regular cleanser taking a pump in palm adding water to it and rubbing it all over my face, washing it off with water\n\n**10/10. Excellent. No notes. HG**. Already on 6th bottle. **WRP Forever**.\n\nIngredients AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, SODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE, COCO-BETAINE, SODIUM COCOYL ISETHIONATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, PCA, PPG-5-CETETH-20, PEG-100 STEARATE, PEG-150 PENTAERYTHRITYL TETRASTEARATE, PEG-6 CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC GLYCERIDES, PEG-30 DIPOLYHYDROXYSTEARATE, CI 77891 / TITANIUM DIOXIDE, ASPARTIC ACID, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, CARBOMER, GLYCOL DISTEARATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, GLYCERYL OLEATE, GLYCINE, TRIDECETH-6, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, THREONINE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, SALICYLIC ACID, SODIUM PCA, SODIUM LACTATE, ARGININE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SERINE, SODIUM BENZOATE, VALINE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, PROLINE, ISOLEUCINE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, ALANINE, PHENYLALANINE, COCONUT ACID, COCO-GLUCOSIDE, CHLORPHENESIN, DISODIUM EDTA, HYDROXYETHYL UREA, CITRIC ACID, HYDROXYETHYL ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, HISTIDINE, ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, POLYQUATERNIUM-53, POLYQUATERNIUM-39, POLYSORBATE 60, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZOIC ACID\n\n**CeraVe** **Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser (4% Benzyl Peroxide)**\n\nTexture: Translucent lotion-y texture, It’s runnier than the Cream to foam cleanser. Foams up well on wet face.\n\nApplication: It’s a wash off BP product. I use it 2x a week. I apply on face, neck and underarms. I leave it on for 5min and wash it off with water. I think it works better this way. If I leave it on for too long it does dry out my skin.\n\nI use it as a body wash too. It helped me with active acne on my face and back. I find it Better than other BP bodywashes and facewashes I tried. It doesn’t strip my skin. I do use a thick moisturiser after this.\n\n**9/10**. I cut one point for the packaging; It leaked on a flight once. **WRP**\n\nIngredients BENZOYL PEROXIDE 4%\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENTS: WATER, GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, COCAMIDOPROPYL HYDROXYSULTAINE, SODIUM C14-16 OLEFIN SULFONATE, XANTHAN GUM, POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, NIACINAMIDE, GLYCOLIC ACID, SODIUM CHLORIDE, SODIUM CITRATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, PROPANEDIOL, CITRIC ACID, TETRASODIUM EDTA, DIETHYLHEXYL SODIUM SULFOSUCCINATE, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZOIC ACID\n\n*Category 2: Serum*\n\n**CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum**\n\nTexture: Off-white runny lotion texture. Spreads easily. Not sticky, layers well under other products in my routine. No added fragrance.\n\nApplication: I started with using it twice a week and built up to every day. I use the sandwich method and layer between essence and a moisturizer. I don’t like it. It didn’t do anything for me. I noticed no difference in my skin except a slight smoothing effect. I find it to be a non-offensive beginner retinol.\n\n**5/10**. Excellent packaging. All Retinol products should come in a pump like this. **WNRP**\n\nIngredients: AQUA/WATER/EAU, PROPANEDIOL, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), CETEARYL ETHYLHEXANOATE, NIACINAMIDE, AMMONIUM POLYACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE, DIPOTASSIUM GLYCYRRHIZATE, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, DIMETHICONOL, LECITHIN, SODIUM CITRATE, RETINOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, ALCOHOL, ISOPROPYL MYRISTATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, CITRIC ACID, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\n*Category 3: Moisturizers*\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturising Lotion**\n\nTexture: Super light gel cream texture. Applies like a dream on my skin. No noticeable fragrance.\n\nApplication: I apply it after Hada Labo lotion. Used it throughout summer, great stand alone moisturizer. It was the only niacinamide product I was using at the time. I don’t like it for colder weather as my skin becomes drier. Excellent in hot weather at night. Helps oil control and the usual niacinamide things. It might feel heavy if you have super oily skin.\n\n**10/10.** No Nonsense night moisturizer in a pump bottle!!! **WRP**.\n\nIngredients : AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, NIACINAMIDE, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), CETEARETH-20, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, POLYGLYCERYL-3 DIISOSTEARATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\n**CeraVe Moisturizing Cream (White Tub)**\n\nTexture: Thick and gooey. The only CeraVe product that has a strange plastic/fevicol smell. The brand says there is no added fragrance so maybe it's just me. \n\nApplication: Applies smooth. Feels super super heavy on my face. I could just feel it sitting heavy on my skin. It didn’t give me any CCs. I used the rest of the tub as a body moisturizer. Great as a body moisturizer.\n\n**4/10.** The tub packaging too is disappointing. **WNRP.**\n\nIngredients: AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, CETEARETH-20, [PETROLATUM](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/petrolatum), POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, TOCOPHEROL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\nSorry for any mistakes.

    "body": "Everyone’s talking about the skincare items for May’s Glam Bag X they all look very nice and high end.  Since I have nothing better to do I thought I would do some analyzing of the skincare items, will they actually do anything for your skin? Let’s have a look.  So far I think the ones we’ve all seen are: Herbivore Prism Mask, Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream, Rodial Pink Diamond Cleansing Balm, The Route Party Peel, Kopari CBD Balm.  There may be more skincare items but these are the ones that are confirmed. \n\nThe three most coveted items are easy to see, Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream, Herbivore’s Prism Mask and Rodial Cleansing Balm so I’ll focus my analysis on these 3 items since I happen to own all of them as well. \n\n- Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream RV $100\n\nHas the highest RV and I’m guessing most people are aiming for this, the packaging is gorgeous from the way you unbox the cream to the jar itself, makes a great gift.  Now onto the ingredients:\n\nWater, Homosalate (sunscreen filter), Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ethylhexyl Salicylate (sunscreen filter), Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane (Avobenzone, the only FDA approved sunscreen filter that has sufficient UVA protection, however it’s not stable hence why sunscreens has to be reapplied), Octocrylene (sunscreen filter) Cetyl Alcohol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Steareth-21, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Carbomer, Dimethiconol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Hydrolyzed Viola Tricolor Extract, Allantoin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Disodium Edta, Tocopheryl Acetate, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Sodium Hydroxide, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Michelia Alba Leaf Oil, Sodium Lactate, Coco-Glucoside, PEG-8, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Plumeria Rubra Flower Extract, Ascorbic Acid, Citric Acid, Nicotiana Sylvestris Leaf Cell Culture, Linalool, Citronellol, Geraniol.\n\nI know the label doesn’t mention this but this moisturizer actually has SPF15 and other UVA filters, most of the top ingredients are all sunscreen filters/stabilizers.  The sunscreen filters that are in the moisturizer are mostly weak ones or are in low concentration like Avobenzone, so this wouldn’t be my sunscreen pick for going out in the sun.  \n\nThen there are the usual occlusive ingredients like silicones and other ingredients which will give the skin a silky smooth finish, of course having Shea Butter gives it a more thicker texture, most of the ingredients that can’t be pronounced are common preservatives/emulsifiers (ingredients that help water and oil mix properly so they don’t separate)/ingredients that help stabilize the formula, most of these ingredients are in normal moisturizers, you won’t find some of them in most “clean beauty” products, however there’s nothing unsafe/toxic about these ingredients which have been in cosmetics for a long time.  \n\nIn terms of beneficial ingredients for the skin, it’s got the common humectants like glycerin, dimethicone, butylene glycol, hyaluronic acid, aloe vera, that attract and hold onto moisture.  Besides the oat kernel extract and Shea butter most of the other ingredients like rose hip oil, cameilla seed oil, sunflower seed oil, etc aren’t in high enough concentrations for the skin to derive any nutrients from them but they accomplish the task of softening the skin.  The BioNymph peptide that’s talked about the description of the cream is “Nicotiana Sylvestris Leaf Cell Culture”, fairly new ingredient it’s a natural peptide, can’t find any studies on it besides the ones coming from the manufacturer.  Obviously those studies show it’s magic protects the skin against anything oh and it also diminishes wrinkles in 2 weeks....sure.  \n\nFinal thoughts on the product: I bought it because of the hype and nice packaging, it does accomplish what a moisturizer is suppose to do, trap and prevent the loss of moisture, most people expect too much from their moisturizers IMO and that’s why companies are creating ridiculous ingredients like bioNymph peptide in order to look special.  I think this moisturizer was originally suppose to be a makeup primer with higher SPF protection but they couldn’t stabilize the Avobenzone, cos it’s a very tricky sunscreen filter and also the ingredients at the top all seem to be suggest this would be a more lightweight product in terms of texture.  The last part of the cream with all the thickening and beneficial ingredients for skin almost came as an after thought.  It’s fairly scented, the last 3 ingredients are all fragrance, but I don’t mind scented products and enjoy the way this smells.  It’s not as heavy as most of my other moisturizers since I have dry skin and like super thick creams. Most people will likely use this at night but I wonder if it’s okay to sleep with sunscreen filters....\n\n- Herbivore Prism Mask RV $58\n\nIngredients list: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit/Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Salix Nigra (Willow) Bark Extract, leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Populus Tremuloides Bark Extract, Gluconolactone, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Sodium Phytate.\n\nMy analysis copied from a reply:\n\n“I have the Herbivore Prism Mask and Serum I bought both when I was still a newbie when it came to skincare ingredients/formulation.  Now that I’ve had to learn more about skincare cos of the constant crap we receive in beauty boxes, I would not recommend the Prism Mask. It uses “natural AHAs” we’ve all seen it before in other products like sugar cane extract, sugar maple extract (maple syrup, very Canadian), lemon extract etc. MANY of these “clean beauty brands” will treat these fruit extracts the same as glycolic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, etc. However they’re completely DIFFERENT!\n\nYes most AHAs are derived from fruit extracts like glycolic acid comes from sugar cane, tartaric and malic comes from maple syrup extract etc, however these acids has to be derived in a lab first, on it’s own these extracts has no PROVEN exfoliation abilities.  Maybe there’s a tiny bit of exfoliating action but because AHAs acids needs to be at the right pH level to work anywhere from pH of 2 to just under 4, from looking at the ingredients of the Prism Mask it’s definitely passed that pH (just a guess, maybe I’ll test the pH later). The closer an AHA exfoliating product gets to the pH of 2, the more free acid value it has. As an example everyone’s favourite lactic acid treatment Sunday Riley GG has only 5% concentration of lactic acid and yet why is it so effective and be loved? It’s because the pH of GG is just around 2.5ish (I tested it with pH strips and got values between 2 and 3 so I’ll just avg it out), at that pH level it can access almost all 5% of the lactic acid in the formula. As another example a product like Saturday Skin’s 10% Glycolic Acid Toner at first looks very promising but when tested the the pH level was between 5-6, making the 10% claim useless since acids can’t do much exfoliating at those pH levels, and the toner can’t access the 10% of glycolic acid and use it properly, making the free acid value basically zero.  When it comes to exfoliating products the percentage of acids doesn’t mean much, it’s all about the pH level and free acid value, if you look at Skinceutical’s Glycolic Overnight Cream on the packaging it doesn’t say this cream contains 10% glycolic acid but rather the free acid value is 10% glycolic.  \n\nAs for the 5% BHA claim, again it uses willow bark extract cos it’s a “clean natural” ingredient, Willow Bark extract contains salicin which only becomes salicylic acid when it’s orally ingested cos of the enzymes in our stomachs, I’m assuming no one wants to eat this mask. Salicylic acid is derived from willow bark extract in labs using a complicated process, thus when applied topically willow bark extract is actually a very good ingredient for inflammation, it soothes the skin, helps with redness etc. It’s good for the skin just not for exfoliating. Lastly the law prohibits any OTC product from having more than 2% salicylic acid (BHA), so these brands get around this by putting 5% BHA on the label hoping people will think 5% willow bark extract is the same as 5% salicylic acid, obviously they’re two completely different ingredients. It’s actually a very good hydrating mask though.”\n\nAlso forget to mention this has zero preservatives not even the new ones that are supposedly so much safer and not toxic, I guess the antibacterial properties of leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate can assist in preserving the product however I’m not a big fan of mold and bacteria so if you do receive this please make sure to check the batch code and when it was manufactured \n\n- Rodial Pink Diamond Cleansing Balm RV $59\n\nIngredients list: Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG-8 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Cetearyl Alcohol, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Germ Oil, Polysorbate 20, Glyceryl Dibehenate, Tribehenin, Glyceryl Behenate, Parfum (Fragrance), Tocopherol , Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Mica, Diamond Powder, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Geraniol, Limonene, Linalool, CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide), CI 75470 (Carmine)\n\nIt’s not really a balm texture, if you’re use to using those K beauty cleansing balms with the sherbet texture or the Farmacy one that will transform from balm/oil to milky emulsion this is different.  When it comes out of the tube it has a oil in gel texture, it removes all my makeup but I don’t wear heavy or waterproof makeup.  It’s heavily scented so maybe not the best for sensitive skin.  It washes off cleanly and comes with a muslin cloth, honestly there’s not too much to say about a cleanser.  I bought it cos I’m a sucker for pretty packaging, it’s nice that it’s in a tube so good for traveling/weekend trips, again the main draw back is the fragrance.\n\nTL:DR - they all make great gifts, as far as skincare benefits....meh.",

But after using this argan oil, I noticed I started having these kind of scalp pimples— which is acalled \"folliculitis\" (inflamed hair follicle). Then after further researching, this Bremod Argan Oil was the cause (based on my own experience) for the following reasons:\n1. Not harmful per se, but not pure argan oil either.\n2. Heavy in silicones (Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethiconol ingredients): which means its great for hair strands but bad if left on the scalp or applied too close to follicles (can clog them, causing folliculitis).\n3. Fragrance ingredients: potential irritants for sensitive scalp or broken skin.\n\nI'm not sure if my scalp is just sensitive that caused to trigger folliculitis, but I just wanted to know if anyone had the same experience and may be able to recommend safe argan oil products?

Cetaphil is available in two sizes- 30gm for Rs 185 and and 100 gm for Rs 435 (often available at some off at Nykaa). Re'equil one is available in only one size, 100gm for Rs 350.\n* *Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:* DAM- HG/WRP, RE'EQUIL: WNRP.\n\n**Experience:** \n\nHello all\n\nUsually I use lighter moisturiser but winters had me looking for an apt moituriser for my skin, since it gets dry and skin tends to become flaky. I was earlier using Simple Light moisturiser and Disguise Cosmetic's Sorbet, but both of these were proving insufficient for winters, hence decided to try DAM and Re'equil.\n\nAs you can see both of them have beautiful ingredients, though Re'equil one has fragrance (it is the last ingredient, the smell is mild and nice) while DAM is fragrance free.\n\nFor my skin type, I require a small amount of both of these  moisturisers. Though Re'equil is heavier- it is a cream albeit not a thick one, while DAM is lighter comparatively and has lotion like consistency.\n\nI started with using DAM during the morning routine. Needless to say, my skin did not feel dry at all. There was no need for reapplication either. It also did not react with my skin. So overall, I am very satisfied with this. Might this be love? Probably.\n\nRe'equil one I used in my PM routine. Now this moisturiser and I go long back because back in June, I got this for my younger sibling, who has a dry-dehydrated skin which is also prone to blackheads, whiteheads and acne. I wanted her to start looking after her skin a bit so I got her a bunch of products, one of which was this. It suited her nicely, though it is another matter altogether that she was never consistent with her routine. I guess skincare enlightenment has to occur on its own to a person for one to really get invested in it. Sigh. \n\nI also would use it occasionally then, and it did feel a little heavy on my combination skin so I decided to use it during winters. Cut to November, I started applying it in my nighttime routine. However after a couple of days, I could see some acne on my forehead. It probably clogged my pores. I stopped using it for some time, and the acne receded (my skin is not acne prone). I thought I should give it a try again, and once more I could see tiny acne on my forehead. I have since then decided to cut it off my routine. It is a great moisturiser, very nourishing. As mentioned, it works for my sister, but unfortunately it is not for me. \n\nRe'equil's finish is more matte, and it can be seen and felt immediately while DAM can feel slightly greasy on immediate application but sinks in fast and also provides a nice, smooth finish.\n\n**Conclusion**: So for the past one week, I have been using DAM in my AM as well as PM routine and I am more than satisfied. I think DAM is going to be my HG for winters atleast. Not sure how it is going to fare in summers, that remains to be seen. Hope this is helpful for folks looking for winter moisturisers. :)",

    "body": "Hi everyone!\n\nThis is me doing a comparative review once again. You can check out my comparative review for winter moisturisers [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/kjuvbt/comparative_review_cetaphil_dam_vs_reequil/).\n\nThe title mentions a lot of moisturisers I know, but all of them have been used in the past one year or so. Summers are icky and choosing a moisturiser has become harder for me. Should I even use one when my skin is wetter and saltier than the Indian Ocean at the moment? idk friends, you tell me. When it is extremely humid and I am stepping out, I do not use a moisturiser. I use a hydrating toner (klairs supple) and sunscreen (I have reviewed all of them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/o9jpj9/sunscreen_comparative_review_neutrogena_innisfree/) )\n\n* *Skin Type:* Combination, oily at the T zone. At the moment, extremely oil at the T Zone, esp during high humidity days.\n* *Current climatic conditions:* Continental, hot and humid at the moment\n* *AGE:* 27 yo female\n* *Usage timeline:* More than a month for all the moisturisers except the FormulaRx one.\n\n1. **Neutrogran Hydroboost Gel:** I do not honestly recall what I was using before I began using this. It is a silicone rich light gel and spreads easily. The texture is light and it does not feel heavy on the skin, though it does not get fully absorbed either. When I used it last year, it seemed okay but did not impress me much. The fragrance was high, which further put me off of it. **I bought it for 800 bucks but I just checked and it now retails for a whooping 1000 bucks for 50gm on Nykaa**. That is honestly too much for this blue jar. I have also seen influencers raving about it calling it \"ocean in a jar\"....Sorry, have they seen the state of the oceans? It is all kachra these days. While the gel is neither ocean nor kachra, **I did not repurchase it and will not do so**, simply because it is way below the mark for me. However it did not break me out.\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\n[Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Dimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Dimethicone/​Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone-vinyl-dimethicone-crosspolymer), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Polyacrylamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyacrylamide), [Cetearyl Olivate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-olivate), [Sorbitan Olivate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitan-olivate), [Dimethiconol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethiconol), [C13-14 Isoparaffin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c13-14-isoparaffin), [Dimethicone Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone-crosspolymer), [Chlorphenesin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/chlorphenesin), [Carbomer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/carbomer), [Laureth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-7), [Sodium Hyaluronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-hyaluronate), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [C12-14 Pareth -12](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-pareth-12), [Sodium Hydroxide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-hydroxide), [Blue 1](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-42090)\n\n**2. Simple Light Hydrating Moisturiser:** I got introduced to this moisturiser through this sub and I really like it! It is hydrating and occlusive as well. Its consistency is somewhere between a gel and a cream- but it is not as light as an emulsion, it is slightly leans towards the lotion side. I usually use it in months that are neither too hot, nor too cold. That is February, March and then September, October and November. In colder months, my skin remains dry despite using it and in hotter and humid months, this feels a little heavy for my combination skin. **I love it over all and it is definitely a no frills, value for money moisturiser, retailing for 430 bucks for 125ml on Nykaa. WRP.** Did not break me out.\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\n[Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Paraffinum Liquidum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/paraffinum-liquidum), [Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyglyceryl-3-methylglucose-distearate), [Dimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone), [Cetyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-palmitate), [Cetyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-alcohol), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Caprylyl Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylyl-glycol), [Carbomer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/carbomer), [Potassium Hydroxide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-hydroxide), [Tocopheryl Acetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tocopheryl-acetate), [Bisabolol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bisabolol), [Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-c10-30-alkyl-acrylate-crosspolymer), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Pantolactone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pantolactone), [Borago Officinalis Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/borago-officinalis-seed-oil), [Potassium Carbonate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-carbonate), [Pentylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentylene-glycol), [Urea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/urea), [Lactic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/lactic-acid), [Sodium Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lactate), [Serine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/serine), [Sorbitol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitol), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Allantoin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/allantoin)\n\n**3. Etude House Soon Jung Moist Relief All in One Gel-** This is the one I am using at the moment and it satisfies my currently very oily Tzone perfectly. It does feel a tad bit less for my cheeks but all the sweat makes for it lol ;\\_; . I tried the emulsion as well in the hopes of meeting all my needs but it feels sticky to me.It seems like I cannot have it all ;\\_;\n\nCompared to HydroBoost, this is way lighter! It is almost watery when applied on the skin.The ingredient list is impressive but I dont know if it has done anything extra special for my skin. It is good enough and that is perfectly satisfactory for me. I don't think it has any occlusives and it mainly just hydrates my skin. So i use it in my AM routine, and use the sunscreen over it. Hopefully that should trap all the moisture in, right? (insert Anakin and Padame meme). I love it and will buy it for summers, especially for the hot and humid months of May, June, July and August. I don't think it can satisfy my skin's needs in the other months. **It retails for 1200 bucks for 120 ml and is available only on Nykaa afaik. WRP.** Has not broken me out either.\n\n**Ingredients:** Water / Aqua / Eau, Propanediol, Panthenol, Silica, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Glyceryl Caprylate, Butylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Ethylhexylglycerin, Madecassoside, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Tocopherol\n\n**4. The FormulaRx Barrier Relief Lightweight Gel Cream:** This is a new kid on the block and the company does not have a good reputation here and rightfully so. I did not want to buy from them but then I sold my soul and compromised my morals all because its emulsion like texture seemed exactly what I wanted and felt it would suit my skin. Sorry heavenly father, I will do better. That said, the texture really is all that. It has ceramides and what not (=niacinamide). The texture is exactly how the long ass name describes it as- a cream-gel, g(j)elly cream etc etc. Also I have only used it only for a week, during my PM routine so these are strictly my first impressions. It sinks in nicely, given you are able to take out the desired amount from the metallic tube. Because often, you wont be- it will squirt out way more than what you need, the packaging is aesthetic but really inconvenient. Even the tube arrived all dented and pichka hua. Overall it is a good moisturiser that I will perhaps continue to use in my PM but I have not yet made my mind whether I'll repurchase it or not. **It retails for 799 bucks for 50gm and I feel it could have been priced lower.**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, caprylic/ capric triglyceride, glycerin, niacinamide, propanediol, cetearyl alcohol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, sodium hyaluronate, colloidal oatmeal, panthenol, allantoin, ceramide np, ceramide ap, ceramide eop, phytosphingosine, cholesterol, linoleic acid, sodium lauroyl lactylate, xanthan gum, butylene glycol, carbomer, tocopherol, phenoxyethanol, dimethicone, disodium edta, linolenic acid, ethylhexylglycerin.\n\nI hope these reviews are helpful! As always, these are my personal impressions and YMMV. So please take it with a pinch of salt. Additionally I have reviewed Disguise Cosmetic's C+C Sorbet [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/jyao20/disguise_cosmetics_cc_sorbet_review/).\n\nAnd yet,  [I still haven't found what I'm looking for](https://youtu.be/e3-5YC_oHjE). I actually did find something that suited me through most months- the Sulwhasoo Essential Balancing Emulsion. The texture and consistency are wonderful. Sinks in nicely. I don't feel dry or greasy. Moreover it brightens up my face. I absolutely love it. Unfortunately I only had a sample size which got over pretty soon ;\\_; I have been tempted to buy the full size but guys, does it make sense to spend 4k on the full size of this emulsion?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**edit(copying this from my comment below)**:  *Unfortunately today i woke with a painful zit. I do not get zits. So either it is because of the formularx moisturiser or the mangoes I am eating everyday. I guess karm ka phal ekdum mil gya.*\n\n It could be the ceramides because I have broken out a little because of them earlier too. Too soon to say it is this moisturiser. Will update here if I find anything conclusive.",

I don't necessarily believe in spending less or more based on the type of product. If it's something that absolutely fits all your bills and you know it won't make you want go buy anything else since it matches you to perfection it's better on getting that one than mindlessly trying to try multiple other products which anyways you wil be spending on.

Found one expensive yes but saves me from buying or being tempted to buy anything else. Also I don't buy the other products in expensive range because I am happy with how the ones I already own function",

    "body": "As a stylist, the most frequent question I get is “how often should I shampoo?”. My response always is \"first and foremost, it's important to know how to shampoo properly so when you do, it counts\".  From how shampoo works to the most common ingredients, I answer all of your shampoo-related questions below. \n\n(This is the entire text from my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html))\n\n**How does shampoo work?** ​\n\nYou can think of the active ingredient in shampoo as being within [two categories](https://www.nycoproducts.com/resources/blog/simple-science-the-difference-between-soap-and-detergent/): (1) non-detergents (soap) and (2) detergents. Non-detergents are made from natural ingredients and act as an emulsifier for oil and water. This makes it easier to rinse impurities away when it's washed out. Detergents are synthetic, man-made chemicals with active agents (wetting agents) capable of lowering the surface tension of a liquid. These are known as [surfactants](https://www.hairstory.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-detergent/), and they do this by having a hydrophilic \"head\" and a hydrophobic \"tail\", which essentially allows the shampoo to stick to oils and dirt in your hair. Those oils and dirt are then swept away when washed out. Another way to understand the difference between non-detergents and detergents: the former will leave a residue behind while the latter will not.[ ](https://www.hairstory.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-detergent/)[Simplifying Hair Products II](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-simplifying-hair-products-ii.html) breaks down the purpose of other ingredients you'll find in shampoos to make them effective and pourable (i.e. the opposite of powered shampoos that are becoming more popular). \n\n**How often should I shampoo?**\n\n​Some hair types will need to shampoo daily and others only need to wash once every ten days or so. Preference also plays a role here depending if you're trying to achieve a sleek look or a voluminous one. Shampooing less will condense your hair over time and allow it to hold more oils, which shampooing more will remove oils and promote a fuller look. Think about the following factors as you keep reading through this post, and check out [Post-Workout Hair](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-post-workout-hair.html) to learn more tips and tricks for managing your hair with a busy life.\n\n*Your hair's density*\n\n* ​*Fine:* Needs to be washed daily, particularly if you have skin that is more oily. People with this hair type often feel that their hair looks too flat if they try to style it without washing and drying it first. \n* *Thick:* Can be washed anywhere from once every three days to once every ten days. People with this hair type often feel that their hair looks too voluminous or puffy if they wash too frequently. Thick hair also takes longer to blow dry and style, making it a nightmare to wash daily because of the amount of time it adds to your routine. \n\n*Your hair's condition/damage*\n\n* ​*Fine:* If your hair is breaking due to damage you should try to shampoo less - every other day to every three days. Giving your hair a break from washing and styling can help with mitigating damage. Use shampoos and conditioners that are moisturizing, even if they give a flatter look then you like. \n* *Thick:* Damage to thicker hair shows more prominently because there is more of it. Straight hair will often appear to have many flyaways, while on curlier hair damage can be easier to hide. Since your styling routine is already longer because of how much hair you have, avoiding a full wash and blow dry (i.e. heat) for as long as possible can help with mitigating damage. \n\n*The type of shampoo and conditioner you use*\n\n* *Fine:* If you aren't worried about damage, look for a volumizing shampoo and conditioner for day-to-day use. Clarifying shampoos will help strip extra oil from your hair, but should only be used once a week alongside a shampoo made for daily use. Avoid clarifying shampoos if your hair is damaged. \n* *Thick:* Look for moisturizing and hydrating shampoos to counteract your volume. [Co-washes](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/news/a56230/co-washing-benefits/) are also a great option for curlier hair, and can be used more frequently since they are a combination of shampoo and conditioner. They're a great option if you need to wash more because of your workout schedule or job. ​\n\n*Your Scalp*​​\n\nYour scalp is an important part of figuring out how, and how much, to shampoo. This takes trial and error, plus may change over time. Generally, you should wash as often as your scalp can handle it because, like the rest of your skin, it is constantly shedding  cells.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that washing your hair has no effect on the amount of oil produced by your sebaceous glands. This depends on hormonal and genetic factors, and the glands have no way of responding to oils on the surface of your scalp. The theory that you could \"train\" your scalp to be less oily was disproven in 1982 by [Kligman and Shelley](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13525782/).\n\nIf you're trying to avoid washing more frequently, then use a mixed boars bristle brush (BBB) to manipulate the scalp and softly remove cell build up. The Reddit page [No-Poo/Natural Hair](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/) is a good resource for advice on maintaining your scalp when shampooing less frequently. ​\n\n* *Signs you may be washing too much:* a scalp that feels dry or tight\n* *Signs you may not be washing enough:* ​excessive product/oil build up​\n\n**What is the proper way to shampoo?** \n\nTo help the shampoo work, emulsify it in your hands before applying. Start applying in at the back of your head, ending at the crown. Take around a minute to apply it. Similar to washing your hands, shampoo takes a few seconds to lift the oils and dirt.\n\n* *When you're looking for volume:* Pay attention to the sides and back of your head when shampooing and rinsing, as these areas are commonly missed. For thicker hair, consider washing (or rinsing) in two sections. If you've gone 3+ days without washing, shampooing twice also makes sense.\n* *When you're looking to smooth/leave natural oils behind:* Generally, use a minimal amount of shampoo and rinse it out fairly quickly. Try conditioning your hair first, then shampooing and conditioning again. See the \"volume\" bullet above if you feel like you need a deep clean. This is helpful but not always necessary.\n\n**Shampoo Ingredients**\n\nMany people search for shampoo via the phrase \"shampoo without chemicals\". Technically, if the shampoo has water in it this will count as a chemical, so a better approach is to search for shampoos via ingredients. I've given you a list to consider below. \n\n*Shampoo Without Silicone*\n\nSoluble silicone formulas can be washed out with gentler shampoos and conditioners that don't contain surfactants, and are capable of achieving the same results as non-soluble silicones. Common names on the bottle include:\n\n* *Non-solu​ble:* Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Amodimethicone, Pheryl trimethicone, Ceteraryl methicone, Dimethiconol, Stearyl dimethicone, Amodimethicone (non-soluble when Trideceth-12 and Cetrimonium Chloride are absent)\n* ​*Soluble:* Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone copolyol, Lauryl methicone copolyol, any silicone with PEG as a prefix\n\n*​Shampoo Without Sulfate and SLS*\n\nAs a rule of thumb, ingredients like Ammonium lauryl sulfate and Ammonium laureth sulfate tend to be easier on sensitive scalps than Sodium lauryl sulfate. To learn more about surfactants, check out [Simplifying Hair Products II](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-simplifying-hair-products-ii.html). \n\n*Shampoo Without Parabens*​\n\nMost water based shampoos contain preservatives because without them they  will eventually grow mold or bacteria. Parabens are a type of preservative that are commonly used in hair products. According to The FDA \"scientists continue to review published studies on the safety of parabens. At this time, we do not have information showing that parabens, as they are used in cosmetics, have an effect on human health\" (Source: [FDA, Parabens in Cosmetics](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-ingredients/parabens-cosmetics)). They're usually easy to spot on the bottle because they end in the word \"paraben\". Common non-paraben preservatives are shown in the list below. To learn more about parabens, check out this article published by Cosmopolitan: [Wait, What Actually Are Parabens and Should You Avoid Them? ](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a28662211/what-are-parabens/)\n\n* [*Common names on the bottle:* Midazolidinyl urea, Iodopropynyl, Isothiazolinone, and Sodium benzoate](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a28662211/what-are-parabens/)\n\n*Shampoo Without Salt*\n\n[Sodium chloride](https://nutrafol.com/blog/15-shampoo-ingredients-to-avoid/) is another name for salt. It's used in shampoo and conditioner mainly to make the consistency thicker. A trend of \"salt shampoos\" has also been seen, where the benefits include being used as a [scrub](https://www.byrdie.com/what-are-salt-shampoos) for the scalp, plus being gentler on the environment. This has may have been influenced by the idea of adding [salt or sea water ](https://www.gourmandize.com/article-6582-put-salt-in-your-shampoo-to-solve-your-worst-hair-problems.htm)to your current shampoo. I wouldn't recommend adding sea water to your shampoo, as this could potentially generate bacteria and mold in your products over time. \n\n**Shampoo/Ingredients For Hair Care Concerns**\n\n*Hair Loss*\n\nFor assisting with hair loss, there are DHT-blocking shampoos plus ones with ingredients that help with inflammation. Saw palmetto, also known as [Serenoa](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/039463201202500435), naturally lowers the conversion of testosterone into Dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is a sex hormone that contributes to human developments such as body hair, but it can also make you lose your hair faster and earlier. If you're experiencing any type of hair loss, the first place to start is with a doctor. You don't want to try different shampoos only to later find out a doctor would have pointed you in a different direction. \n\n*Hair Growth*\n\nShampoos with biotin are frequently marketed as being helpful for hair growth. It is also commonly added to shampoos claiming to reduce hair loss, but there is no [evidence](https://www.webmd.com/connect-to-care/hair-loss/does-biotin-really-prevent-hair-loss) that it prevents this. Consuming foods rich in healthy vitamins and minerals will help with overall hair health.\n\n*Dry Scalp*\n\nSome contributing factors to a dry or itchy scalp can't be solved with a shampoo. However, certain ingredients can offer relief.\n\n* ​​*Salicylic acid:* This can be found in drug store shampoos advertising scalp health. It will help remove scalp cells causing dandruff while also moisturizing dry spots. Consider using it seasonally during dry winter months, or on a regular basis as needed. \n* *Selenium sulfide:* Formulated to control more serious dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp. It's also used to treat pityriasis versicolour, a common fungal infection that causes small patches of skin to become scaly and discoloured.\n* *Ketoconazole:* An ingredient that provides the same benefits as Selenium sulfide.\n* *Tea Tree Oil:* [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1360273/) have shown that tea tree oil effectively fights many types of bacteria, viruses and fungi. These shampoos tend to be very calming and cleansing.\n\n*Naturally Grey Hair Turning Yellow* \n\nUse two types of shampoo: (1) a purple shampoo and (2) a moisturizing shampoo. Grey hair tends to pick up unwanted yellow tones from the environment, and purple shampoo will help combat these tones. The moisturizing shampoo helps prevent your hair from becoming too dry, which can be exacerbated by purple shampoo.

    "body": "I’m From Mugwort Cream\n\nThe mugwort line from I’m From features some of my favorite soothing/calming products. Artemisia/mugwort is known for its ability to bring down redness and inflammation...and I’m From’s offerings contain some of the higher percentages of the ingredient that I have seen.\n\nTheir Mugwort Cream contains 73.55% mugwort extract alongside shea butter, father david elm extract, and fermented soybean/cogon grass extracts. The entire formulation reads like an herbal remedy that I imagine being concocted at an apothecary.\n\nAs for the consistency/texture...I was quite surprised. The cream has a lightweight look and nearly gel-like feel when first applied. But, once it’s gotten a chance to absorb there is a bit more of an occlusive feel and even slight residue left behind (which might not be ideal for those with oily skin that prefer really watery hydrators).\n\nHowever, it ended up being the lack of immediate calming/soothing that made this product a bit less impressive than the rest of the I’m From Mugwort products.\n\nWhile I did see an improvement to redness and irritation over the course of the past month...there wasn’t that immediate hit of redness reduction that I appreciated in the other products. I could always turn to the I’m From Mugwort Essence to bring my skin back from the brink when adjusting to Tretinoin or after being in the sun too long. \n\nThe I’m From Mugwort Cream just doesn’t seem to have that “triage” ability that I was hoping to see. The amount of hydration and moisture-locking ability is really nice though. Dry/normal skin that experiences redness or sensitivity might get along well with this product...but there might be a slower build to visible calming results. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Artemisia Princeps Extract, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Glycerin, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Stearic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Arachidyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Flower Extract, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, C14-28 Alkyl Acid, Stearyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-2 Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Allatoin, Boswellia Serrata Resin Extract, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/ VP Copolymer, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/ Sodium Acryloydimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Dimethiconol, Saccharamyces/ Viscum Album (Misletoe) Ferment Extract, Lactobacillus/ Soybean Ferment Extract, Saccharomyces/ Viscum Album (Misletoe) Ferment Extract, Lactobacillus/ Soybean Ferment Extract, Saccharomyces/ Imperata Cylindrica Root Ferment Extract, Disodium EDTA, Polyglutamic Acid, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Artemisia Vulgaris Oil\n\nWhere To Buy ($32.00 USD - Wishtrend - 50ml): [https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/mugwort-cream/](https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/mugwort-cream/) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/660kxqxxhrq51.jpg?width=4707&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f44858c40b452cc060e2e1922a84175baf307379",

I started using this into my third week of tret and oh boy, i had super dry skin!\n\nWhen you apply this, you get a cooling sensation and it blends into the skin very nicely and doesn’t leave you looking super shining. (You might not like this if you have dry skin and want some glow from your moisturizer.) This product has a hight amount of dimethicone and if you’re prone to clogged pores, I would say avoid this even though it claims to be “non-comedogenic”. The instructions on the box also say to massage until fully absorbed into the skin. \n\nNo pilling issues with sunscreens which was surprising because I was expecting it for some reason lol😆\n\nIt definitely kept my skin moisturized for good 5-6 hours and after that, my skin wasn’t like super dry but I still felt that I needed some hydration. What I observed though, I think this baby might have repaired my barrier which may have been a teeny bit compromised from tretinoin use at that time but I am not entirely sure. My skin now is no longer very dry. Either the product works really well or my retinization process is complete. I think this’ll work well for most skin types except maybe super dry and super oily folks. \n\n\n**Rating**: 4/5 Might repurchase only because I rarely repurchase stuff and always on the hunt for the next best thing. Also, the quantity you get is depressing😭😭 and the packaging was very inconvenient (feeble plastic tub container)",

I’m still using it right now because I haven’t had time to return it and buy another moisturizer. I have skin on the drier side, not eczema type, probably combo skin and it didn’t work for me. My sister has an oily skin type and it works for her just fine so everyone’s different. I don’t think it gives me enough moisture since my skin still gets dried and flakey-looking around my nose and chin aside from breaking me out. It’s been 2-3 weeks on this thing so far. It also leaves my skin looking matte, so prolly better for oily skin. I like the dewy look better. \n\nBefore buying this, I had a trader joe’s gel moisturizer, that broke me out too since it had coconut. I used to have the cosrx snail mucin cream moisturizer and that seemed to work much better than either of these for me, and bonus points for that dewy look (if I recall, I think it did started breaking me out slightly towards the end of the jar likely bc of contamination). I’m done with gels. They don’t give me enough moisture. But also, too much moisture breaks me out so idk 😭. \n\nNow I’m looking for a light cream, not in a jar. Any suggestions?",

    "body": "Shooting straight is about as complicated as splitting an atom. If I weren’t over caffeinated lounging on the couch on a Saturday, I wouldn’t have time to write the following. But this sums up everything I’ve done in the past 13 months.\n\nI grew up shooting and had daily access to a table til i was 26. My high school had two tables where there was always a crowd betting, yelling, and trying to throw you off your game. One of my first big purchases out of college was a 9 foot Brunswick table. I was automatic sober or three sheets to the wind.\n\nThen moved to a place where my table would not fit, then moved across the country. 11 years off. Fast forward to when im 37 and i got a cheap schmelke cue for xmas. Started shooting with buddies then got an invite to a APA team. Could not pocket to save my life. If i had something straight on, i may as well have just moved on with my life. But i did have nights where i was automatic which gave me hope. After i was done blaming the cue stick, here is what i worked on in order (fwiw, i shortened the ferrule, put on a kamui tip, and got a nice $20 shaper/scuffer)\n\n1.\t⁠Beer bottle trick with a mirror or phone camera to make sure my back arm is not askew.\n\n2.\t⁠Tor Lowry half table pattern play video- the free you tube clip had five drills. Id pause the video, copy down the ball positions on some looseleaf, and when i would do the drills IRL, id tear off the corner of a sticker to mark the ball positions and do it over and over. Either that or draw a circle with chalk.\n\nTwo examples here. Run in numerical order and cue ball has to stay on one side of the table. Use only top or draw [examples](https://imgur.com/gallery/jQ2lfRP)\n\n3. this is actually a multi step tip that helped me eliminate squirt- If you follow this sub enough, you’ll notice that one of the most common tips is to have as light a grip as possible on your back hand. When i use anything more than that, i tend to have a chicken wing that pulls in my back hand towards my body and then imparts unintended english. Hence, i couldn’t shoot a straight in shot to save my life due to squirt/spin/whatever. Do the beer bottle trick to get an idea of what that minimum amount of grip pressure is. Pay specific attention to the pendulum your back hand creates where forward motion turns to reverse motion (tip near cue ball) and where reverse motion turns to forward motion (tip furthest away from cue ball). If the cue slips in your back hand, tighten up but remember, less is more. When you finally hit the cue ball, its almost as if youre throwing a dart under-handed and you dont pull back.\n\nI switched to a pointer finger/thumb-only grip 99% of time. But..\n\nThere are three things at play that you can increase and decrease. First, as slick and slippery a shaft as possible. As dry a bridge hand as possible. As tacky a back hand grip as possible.\n\nI take kitchen pantry wax paper and just rub onto my irish linen grip in the direction of the linen threads. This helps me keep as light a grip possible but cue doesnt slip when the cue changes direction in my practice strokes.\n\nRunning your bridge hand under scalding hot water does something to the sweat glands, and your skin dries up. I live in New Orleans, and its very muggy- i do this before i leave the house bc our APA home bar does not have very hot water. Hand chalk, talcum, etc achieves the same end.\n\nI just found this tip about a month ago to create a very slippery shaft. A year of playing and the maple shaft was knicked up and gunked up. I steamed out what knicks i could (search the sub). Then i took a mr clean magic eraser and cleaned the shaft and ferrule. Auto zone has sand paper for paint repair- i took 800 grit and sanded up the shaft and followed up with 2,500 grit. Smooth as glass. followed up w carnauba wax, also from autozone. If youve heard of Cue Silk, it works but the active ingredient is also found in hair care products (cue silk is sold at a 2000% markup). I went to sally beauty supple around the corner and bought\n\nCyclomethicone and/or Dimethiconol or Dimethicone. [anti frizz spray](https://imgur.com/gallery/oRCQC3D)\n\nLook for products with those ingredients but its basically anti-frizz stuff\n\nSpray shaft with this stuff, it stays slick and smells like grandma.\n\n4. When i walk the shot, i stand behind the object ball and i imagine two toothpicks coming out of the ball, right on the aiming line. Not sure why thats the imagery i use, but it works.\n\nWhen i get behind the cue ball, i steal an Efren Reyes trick where i aim using the very top or bottom of cue ball to find true center. That very top part of the sphere connects to the appropriate part of the toothpick. Shoot.",

    "body": "So, Superdrug brought out a Calm Skin range at the end of last year. [It's now finally up on the website](https://www.superdrug.com/search?text=calm+skin), meaning I can post about it without having to type out all the ingredients by hand ;)\n\nThe range has a night mask, a facial oil, a cleanser, a 'rescue gel', a hydrating spray and a 2-in-1 serum/moisturiser. They're all £2.99, and they're all on buy 1 get 1 half price. I bought 4 products - the mask, the rescue gel, the spray and the serum/moisturiser. I skipped on the cleanser, as it has SLS, and I couldn't be bothered with the oil at the time, especially since I wanted even numbers because of the offer. \n\nI also emailed Superdrug's customer support to enquire about the % of niacinamide, as I was worried it would be insufficient. After some back-and-forth, the customer service rep contacted the new product team and got this response:\n\n\"I cannot give out specific information regarding our formulations but I can confirm that the percentage of niacinamide is >5% in all of the below.\"\n\nThe below being the four products I was asking about, I imagine. (The oil doesn't have niacinamide, btw - it's only soluble in water)\n\nAnyway, nice!\n\nAfter a month or so of testing on and off, here's my mini reviews of the ones that I got:\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin De-Stress Refreshing Facial Spritz 100ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Cleansing-Lotion/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-De-Stress-Refreshing-Facial-Spritz-100ml/p/741142)**\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, Glycerin, Niacinamide, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Trideceth-9, Betaine, Sodium Benzoate, Parfum, Potassium Sorbate, Bisabolol, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Citric Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid), Sodium Hydroxide, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** Moisturising spray? It's kind of weird. There's a slight oiliness to it, and a definite stickiness which is probably the large amount of glycerin. \n\n**Scent:** Definitely floral, vaguely chamomile-y\n\n**Overall Experience:** So, this is... a bit weird? I've mostly been using it as a hydrating toner. The difficulty is that it plays nice with some serums/moisturisers, but with others it seems to lead to bobbling. But I am rather bobble-prone, so it might just be me. Anyway, if I can get it to go on okay it definitely makes me feel more hydrated, particularly when I'm in the dry-aired office I keep complaining about. One day I was feeling kinda bored so I tried out the '7 skin' method by spraying it on every few minutes until it wouldn't absorb any more. I think I got to about six? It definitely hydrated my skin! And probably calmed it down as well. Is it a bad idea to put so much niacinamide on your skin? I don't know, but it's unlikely I'm going to be doing this on a regular basis.\n\n**Will I repurchase?** Well, it's a very cheap, very hydrating toner, so probably.\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin Hydrating 2in1 Serum & Moisturiser 50ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Face-Cream/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-Hydrating-2in1-Serum-%26-Moisturiser-50ml/p/741125)**\n\n**Ingredients:**Aqua, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Isopropyl Myristate, Niacinamide, ‭Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Polyacrylamide, Butylene Glycol, ‭Phenoxyethanol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethiconol, Parfum, Betaine, Laureth-7, ‭Bisabolol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Alcohol, ‭Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid), Cimicifuga Racemosa ‭Root Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower ‭Extract, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, ‭Sodium Benzoate, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** So siliconey it's vaguely unnerving\n\n**Scent:** Heady floral, not unpleasant but kinda odd to find in this context. It's not at all chamomile-like? More of a tuberose, kinda luxe-y but definitely not one for people who don't like heavy scent\n\n**Overall Experience:** So, I think the reason it's described as a 2-in-1 is that there's SO MUCH SILICONE you really can't use much else with it or it will turn into a peeling gel, which is what it did to me several times. I think it might be a good thing for me in the summer when I need something very light, but right now I want to use a heavier, more wintery moisturiser and to layer stuff and this isn't meant for that at allll\n\n**Will I repurchase?** I don't know, let me try it out in the summer and see if I can find a sunscreen that'll play nice with it.\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin Rescue Gel 15ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Cleansing-Lotion/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-Rescue-Gel-15ml/p/741146)**\n\n**Ingredients:**Aqua, Alcohol Denat., Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Glycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Salicylic Acid, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Trideceth-9, Sodium Benzoate, Parfum, Bisabolol, Potassium Sorbate, Allantoin, Alcohol, Propylene Glycol, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile)Flower Extract, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** Gel\n\n**Scent:** Alcohol\n\n**Overall Experience:** Okay, so in the cold light of day I should have looked at that ingredient list and run screaming. Why are they trying to combine salicylic acid (works best at pH <3.5) and niacinamide (becomes irritating at pH<4.5)? Why is the fourth ingredient citric acid? Did putting on an alcohol gel ever help a single spot?\nI did actually try this a couple of times and it did nothing much, which honestly is better than I should have expected, by rights it should have made my face fall off.\n\n**Will I repurchase?** Nope\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin Overnight Face Mask 100ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Cleansing-Lotion/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-Overnight-Face-Mask-100ml/p/741143)**\n\n**Ingredients:**Aqua, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, ‭Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, Prunus ‭Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, ‭Phenoxyethanol, Polyacrylamide, Parfum, Sodium ‭Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Betaine, ‭Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Isohexadecane, C13-14 ‭Isoparaffin, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 80, Bisabolol, ‭Ethylhexylglycerin, Alcohol, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate ‭(Hyaluronic Acid), Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Sorbitan ‭Oleate, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, ‭Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium ‭Benzoate, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** Gloop. Sinks in pretty quickly.\n\n**Scent:** Light floral\n\n**Overall Experience:** Help, I really like this. It goes on nicely even over other stuff (eg Scinic Honey AIO), is nice and occlusive, smells okay and - the kicker - actually leaves my skin looking better in the morning, with red marks noticeably diminished. My only complaint is that it's tiny, considering you'll want to use a hefty glop of the stuff.\n\n**Will I repurchase?** Almost certainly",

Did putting on an alcohol gel ever help a single spot? \n\nSalicylic acid isn't just a chemical exfoliant, it's also anti-inflammatory, which would make it calming on inflammation. Niacinamide isn't necessarily irritating in higher pH products, otherwise the vast majority of skincare products with niacinamide would be irritating, since most products aren't formulated at <pH 4.5. Alcohol denat. is a penetration enhancer and many people don't have issues with alcohol in skincare, particularly if their skin is in good condition to begin with and/or if they don't have alcohol in every single product. Citric acid is a pH adjuster. It's almost impossible just by looking at an ingredient list to be able to talk at length about the overall formula, and none of these ingredients in a normal product are 'face falling off' level of concern.

    "body": "Day 4/7 this brand is underrated but their products work better than other brands I know of. So this brand is cruelty-free and vegan. It focuses more on sensitive skin, clean ingredients, hydration, and improving the skin Barrier in the long term. Any skin type can use the products and the main ingredient is the olive squalene and hyaluronic acid. They also use a blend of three different hyaluronic acid sizes (they have the smallest HA size for skincare in the world). If you've ever been to Sephora and saw that expensive and much-raved brand that uses squalene oil in everything, this is a cheaper alternative. The pH of everything is a 5.5. If you are looking for something for sensitive skin I'd think this is a good brand. \n\nDisclaimer: what worked for me might not work for you. I was gifted 3 of the products last year which got me interested in the entire line.\n\nEdit : some if the products have been reformulated so im not sure how it might impact the product. \n\nDual moist toning lotion 180ml:\n\nTo me, it's not worth it and there are definitely better hydrating toners worth your money. However, if every toner irritates you and you have dehydrated skin or just really sensitive skin you will like this. This is a good hypoallergenic hydrating basic toner. My friend has eczema and acne prone skin and loves this toner but now I got her wanting the pyunkang Yul's acne line. It's more viscous than water and dispensed well also comes sealed. \n\nIngredients - Water, Glycerin, Glycereth-26, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Arginine, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ceramide NP, Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Avena Sativa (Oat) Meal Extract, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Sodium Citrate, Disodium EDTA, Octyldodecanol, Dodecane, Isohexadecane, Isoeicosane, Octadecane, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Citric Acid, Tetradecane, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Linoleic Acid\n\n❤️Dual moist comfort cream 75ml:\n\nMy favourite daytime moisturiser works well in winter and summer it's perfect if your oil-water balance is out if wack. In the summer is adjust excessive sebum so I sweat less on my face but keeps me hydrated in the winter time. Feels like a gel, absorbs fairly quickly. It's a basic essential. Uses panthenol, madecassoside, and Allantoin to soothe, repair and strengthen skin. \n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-10, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, Dimethicone, Squalane (Olive Squalane), Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Arginine, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Ceramide NP, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Butylene Glycol, Carbomer, Dimethiconol, Octyldodecanol, Dodecane, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Isohexadecane, Isoeicosane, Sorbitan Isostearate, Polysorbate 60, Octadecane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, PEG-20 Glyceryl Stearate, Potassium Hydroxide, Tetradecane, Disodium EDTA, PEG-100 Stearate, Polyglutamic Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Linoleic Acid\n\n❤️Dual moist hyaluronic Essence 100ml:\n\nclaims to rapidly hydrate even dry or sensitive skin without irritation. It does work. One if my favourite essences an alternative to the cosrx snail in terms of the hydrating effects your skin gets. If you are vegan and want the hydrating effects and healing effects of Centella Asiatica and vitamin E from tocopherol this could be great for you. My skin was soothed and cooled down, quickly. Absorbs fairly fast feels and hydrating on the skin. \n\nEdit: I repurchased this and didn't notice any actual change to the product still worked. I tried like putting drops of both on my face and I guess the new formula kept my skin more hydrated. But it still works the same but if you have an allergy to anything in the new formulation I'd pass. \n\nIngredients \n\nWater, Pentylene Glycol, Polyglycerin-3, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Collagen, Madecassoside, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, C14-22 Alcohols, Xanthan Gum, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Gaultheria Procumbens (Wintergreen) Leaf Extract, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate\n\nUpdated formula:\nWater, PentyleneGlycol, Squalane, Polyglycerin-3, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Gardenia TahitensisFlower, Tocopherol, CamelliaSinensisLeaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita(Matricaria) FlowerExtract, CentellaAsiatica Extract, AloeBarbadensis LeafExtract, LavandulaAngustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Glycerin,Cetearyl Olivate,Sorbitan Olivate, C14-22 Alcohols, Xanthan Gum, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside,PulsatillaKoreanaExtract, ZanthoxylumPiperitum Fruit Extract,UsneaBarbata(Lichen) Extract, Arginine, Gaultheria Procumbens(Wintergreen) Leaf Extract\n\nFluid oil 30ml:\n\nIf you have TO squalene oil I'll pass on this one they both have 100% organic squalene oil. This one is more cosmetically elegant but save $30 while you can if you are interested in squalene oil by itself. \n\nEmollient extra comfort cream 75ml\n\nContains panthenol too (D-panthenol contains vitamin B5) it feels sticky when applied. If your skin is dry or dehydrated or if you have combination skin but live in a dry climate you will enjoy this. It's a really heavy cream and I dislike the feeling since it takes a while to absorb but my skin doesn't feel hydrated. \n\nIngredients : \n\nWater, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Panthenol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glycerin, Squalane(Olive Squalane), Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Arginine, Ceramide NP, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Carbomer, Octyldodecanol, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Wax, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Dodecane, Isohexadecane, Isoeicosane, Octadecane, Tetradecane, Dimethicone, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Disodium EDTA, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Butylene Glycol, Glucose, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Linoleic Acid\n\nNew formulation - Water, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Squalane, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate,Cetearyl Olivate, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Canola Oil, Xanthan Gum, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Gaultheria Procumbens (Wintergreen) Leaf Extract\n\nEmollient cleansing bar\n\nDoesn't contain any harsh sulfates or anything but I don't like cleansing bars in general. Good for body and face and it won't dry your skin out if you have oily - combo skin. Honestly, there are so many better cleansing gels/milks/foams that I think work better than this bar. It's cleansing properties are abysmal at best and it struggles to remove even the minimal makeup I wear occasionally. My friend hated this too and pointed out to me that looks like it can easily get bacteria on the product. \n\nIngredients:\n\nTriticum Vulgare Wheat Starch, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Potassium Lauryl Sulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Aqua, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Avocado Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Calophyllum Inophyllum, Olea Europaea, Squalidae, Sodium Hyaluronate, D-Panthenol, Tocopherol Acetate, Glycerin, Spinacia Olearacea Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Sapindus Trifoliatus, Apium Graveolens (Celery) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Spinacia Oleracea L., Chorella, Allantoin, Olive Butter\n\nI think they are. Trying to do something cool with their brand but because what they focus on are pretty basic stuff not all people may like it. I think the dual moist comfort cream is a great moisturiser for any skin type and the essence and toner are good items. However, by making products like the cleansing bar or their clay mask (which you can't purchase anywhere anymore)... By only using this brand in my routine my skin looked dull despite being hydrated. My friend who tried some of the products with me saw her skin Barrier become healthier over the next few months and her sensitivity to products decreased slightly. Anybody with a sensitive skin type or dehydrated - dry skin would enjoy trying some of the line. You can get the brand on stylekorean.com, yesstyle, roseroseshop, or ohholly\n\nHope this was helpful i feel like it was kind of a messy review 😅\n\nEdit: It remind me of the ordinary because of the reformulation changes and how they use olive squalene (squalene derived from olives) instead of shark squalene to make it cruelty free.

I need a moisturizer that's **free of fragrance, essential oils, regular oils, and dye.** I've been using the Neutrogena Hydroboost Gel Cream Extra-Dry per the recommendation of my dermatologist, and it's literally the only face cream I can find that has basic ingredients and doesn't bother me.\n\nIngredients:\n\n>Water, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Cetearyl Olivate, Polyacrylamide, Sorbitan  Olivate, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone/vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer,  Synthetic Beeswax, C13-14 isoparafin, Dimethiconol, Carbomer,  Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Chlorphenesin, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate,  Ethylhexylglycerin, C12-14 pareth-12, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny good dupes?  I've searched through some brands that are supposed to be good for sensitive skin but lots of the products I found contain fancy (and unnecessary, imo...)  extracts that I'm worried my skin will react to.\n\n  \nI also want to find a good dupe for Dove's Daily Moisture Conditioner. I haven't used it in a few years since switching to CF products, but honestly I miss it and I can't find a CF conditioner that works the same way (it made my hair sooooo soft and was light but moisturizing). I have very fine, heat and bleach damaged blonde hair that's naturally wavy-curly but straightens easily, and doesn't respond well to heavy moisturizers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks! :)  \n\n\n&#x200B;",

The packaging is made from recycled plastic fished out of the ocean. They’re a professional brand, but search a salon near you that carries Kevin Murphy. You’ll be sure to find one. I live in San Diego, the salon I buy my KM products from is down the street. Called Belli Capelli. They ship if you call I believe. An easy product to get is Maria Nila Head And Hair Heal S/C and Masks are bomb too. Those two are definitely C/F and worth it. You can google Cosmo Prof Beauty and find Maria Nila products. They ship anywhere, and you don’t need a license to buy them. Be sure you buy any professional hair products from a licensed distributor. You’ll find them on Amazon, and Target, etc. but those are probably knock off. \n\nAs for a dupe for neutrogena hydro boost, I used a K brand recently I loved. It does have essential oils, but it’s free of fragrance. \nBelif The True Cream Aqua Bomb is great! Smells so good and it’s super hydrating. I got it at Sephora. The great thing about them is their return policy is no questions asked for 30 days. If you want affordable, Inkey List makes a good hydro boost like gel moisturizer. It’s called Bio Active Cerimide Repairing and Plumping moisturizer. I’ve searched far and wide for dupes. I bought the regular neeutrogena hydro boost gel moisturizer and noticed it burns around my eyes a bit. So I’m probably going to be getting the one you’re using, or going for the Belif moisturizer I mentioned. I’m huge on buying C/F if I can. I try my best everyday not to cause harm to innocent creatures by buying beauty products that are tested on them. It gets exhausting, tbh. I haven’t consumed animals in 20 years. Been a vegetarian most of my life. Vegan for a good chunk of it. But vegan isn’t always healthy. Most of these brands we see everywhere are owned by a parent company that’s not c/f. Even though the brand itself is “leaping bunny cert”. Because of my vegetarian lifestyle I’ve invested in for years, I’ve been down some rabbit holes with cruelty free products. If you know, YOU KNOW! If you have any questions, send me a message. Hope my long list helps some people on their journey down the cruelty free haircare and skincare rabbit hole. The brands I listed solid. Great brands. High quality. I’ve tried all of those with rosacea at 47 years old. With dry af hair down to my waist. A good tip is to trim once a year and stop chemical treating. Don’t forget to wear your sunscreen. If you want any advice on spf products, I’ll be around. Take care!",

I think the lube is worth a shot if your hair does well with serums and if you're into minimalist haircare and want shine. I'm actually tempted to try it myself as I'm trying to put the brakes on the protein for a while, and my hair looks fluffy and shapeless if I don't use serum of some sort. The lack of scent is a bonus. Fwiw if you're worried about buildup, these silicones will all wash out with either sulfates, or non-sulfated surfactants, (as long as your shampoo includes at least 2 of them, which most of them do.) Cyclomethicone will evaporate on its own. Vitamin E is a common hair and skincare ingredient and would not concern me unless you have a known sensitivity.",

    "body": "Hey everyone! I received my first **Play by Sephora** bag last month and decided to review each product as I run through it. I'm adding each product individually into my routine, so I can see individual benefits/effects (if any!).\n\nThis is my first time doing a review like this, and I'm planning on submitting a big giant review of a bunch of my empties of products I've been using the last year. **So if you have any suggestions for future reviews, please let me know! CCW**\n\n**Intro to my skin**\n\n* VERY oily t-zone, normal cheeks, normal-to-dry jaw line and around mouth; light-to-medium skin tone\n\n* VERY VERY CC-prone, mainly on my forehead (some on chin). This is mainly due to not being consistent with my routine (especially simply washing my face with a cleanser, which is the minimum I need). This can also occur from moisturizer.\n\n* No issues with acne, except a few whiteheads around my menstrual cycle\n\n* Main skin concerns: Oil control, reducing appearance of giant nose pores, preventing CCs, even skin tone, healthy aging, trying to reduce the use of fragrances\n\n**Product Review**\n\n***Product:*** Biossance Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer\n\n***Product Type:*** Light-weight moisturizer (which I was excited about!)\n\n***Cost:*** **$$$** - ~32.5 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Squalane, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Pentylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Lactococcus Ferment Lysate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Dimethiconol, Chrondrus Crispus Extract, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterols, Linoleic Acid, Phospholipids, Sodium Phytate, Lechithin, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lactic Acid, Lepidium Sativum Sprout Extract, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract.\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Great light-weight moisturizer**; **Fragrance-free**; **Contains silicones**; **Fatty alcohol-free**; Contains fatty acids; thin consistency; no noticeable smell; absorbs quickly\n\n***Length of use:*** This sample lasted me approximately 1 week of PM only use\n\n***My experience:*** I liked this product! I'm very prone to CCs from even light-weight moisturizers, and this one did not break me out or cause any noticeable blemishes. It absorbs very quickly into the skin, and does leave my skin feeling soft and moisturized. I like the idea that the squalane is the main moisturizing ingredient in this product - squalane always sits well on my skin. Plus, I liked that I didn't have to do an additional squalane product mixed into the moisturizer since the squalane is already \"built in\" to the moisturizer, therefore reducing the number of products I'm using at night.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** This stuff claims to \"Calm the look of skin redness\" and \"Reduce the appearance of pore size\". Neither of these claims I found to be true. In fact, I found that it actually increased redness around my nostrils, which normally gets a little dry for me. When I applied this product, I would feel a slight stinging around my nostrils, followed by redness. This didn't last, so it was likely from something irritating my skin. But I did not find my natural redness being reduced after 1 week. And no - it did not reduce the appearance of pores. Granted, these lackluster results could be due to the size of the sample - not being able to use the product longer than one week. Also can't make any claims toward the \"probiotic\" effects of this product - it feels a little gimmick-y to me. [Change my mind](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/344/294/fe2.jpg).\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5 stars, mainly due to lackluster results. WNRP due to cost - I'd rather stick to my affordable moisturizer + affordable squalane.\n\n[Pictures!](https://imgur.com/a/xpYpZma)\n\n1. Empty-ish container\n2. Consistency\n3.

So here's how to make a hair oil that is the perfect dupe.\n\nSo Uberlube is a company that sells silicone lube for $32. This bottle is the same mL as Moroccan Oil Treatment. When you look at the ingredients, you'll quickly realize that they are practically the same except for Argan Oil.\n\nDimethicone, Dimethiconol, Cyclomethicone, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E)\n\nSo there you have it, mix Argan Oil (\\~$12) with Uberlube and it's a perfect dupe for the Moroccan Oil Treatment, but no fragrance and in fact, cheaper than Moroccan Oil Treatment when you look at cost per oz.\n\nNow enjoy your shiny hair!",

    "body": "I’m From Mugwort Cream\n\nThe mugwort line from I’m From features some of my favorite soothing/calming products. Artemisia/mugwort is known for its ability to bring down redness and inflammation...and I’m From’s offerings contain some of the higher percentages of the ingredient that I have seen.\n\nTheir Mugwort Cream contains 73.55% mugwort extract alongside shea butter, father david elm extract, and fermented soybean/cogon grass extracts. The entire formulation reads like an herbal remedy that I imagine being concocted at an apothecary.\n\nAs for the consistency/texture...I was quite surprised. The cream has a lightweight look and nearly gel-like feel when first applied. But, once it’s gotten a chance to absorb there is a bit more of an occlusive feel and even slight residue left behind (which might not be ideal for those with oily skin that prefer really watery hydrators).\n\nHowever, it ended up being the lack of immediate calming/soothing that made this product a bit less impressive than the rest of the I’m From Mugwort products.\n\nWhile I did see an improvement to redness and irritation over the course of the past month...there wasn’t that immediate hit of redness reduction that I appreciated in the other products. I could always turn to the I’m From Mugwort Essence to bring my skin back from the brink when adjusting to Tretinoin or after being in the sun too long. \n\nThe I’m From Mugwort Cream just doesn’t seem to have that “triage” ability that I was hoping to see. The amount of hydration and moisture-locking ability is really nice though. Dry/normal skin that experiences redness or sensitivity might get along well with this product...but there might be a slower build to visible calming results. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Artemisia Princeps Extract, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Glycerin, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Stearic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Arachidyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Flower Extract, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, C14-28 Alkyl Acid, Stearyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-2 Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Allatoin, Boswellia Serrata Resin Extract, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/ VP Copolymer, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/ Sodium Acryloydimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Dimethiconol, Saccharamyces/ Viscum Album (Misletoe) Ferment Extract, Lactobacillus/ Soybean Ferment Extract, Saccharomyces/ Viscum Album (Misletoe) Ferment Extract, Lactobacillus/ Soybean Ferment Extract, Saccharomyces/ Imperata Cylindrica Root Ferment Extract, Disodium EDTA, Polyglutamic Acid, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Artemisia Vulgaris Oil\n\nWhere To Buy ($32.00 USD - Wishtrend - 50ml): [https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/mugwort-cream/](https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/mugwort-cream/) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gej52o8uhrq51.jpg?width=4707&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69c33d2c3502651329ebd0b47e18a465bf9de2d1",

You can learn from it that your skin loves silicones like dimethicone and dimethiconol, and that it does well with humectants like glycerin and panthenol. Other things that stand out about it: it's preserved with parabens which are probably less irritating than more \"natural\" preservatives and it's fragrance-free. It's impossible to say what it is that your skin didn't like in other moisturizers, but those are the things that jump out to me.  \n\nBoth the Eucerin moisturizer and the LRP fluide contain glycerin, but neither one has good occlusives like u/vladjamin said.

Start out with a layer of either the Olay Hydrogel or the Eucerin Urea, let it dry a little bit (but not fully) and top it off with a thin layer of the LRP Cicaplast Baume B5.

    "body": "Hello Ladies! I thought I would create this post as I haven’t seen a very detailed thread about hair care yet. We often talk about skincare and beneficial or terrible ingredients here and on the wider web, however I always think hair care is never as thoroughly investigated. I’m a total newbie at hair styling, however I will blow my own trumpet and say after years of research and trial and error I’m pretty good at hair care. This will probably be very long even without me going into lots of detail, but feel free to ask in comments for more detail on specific things that interest you and I will expand. Also chime in with any extra info, especially if you’re curly haired! My experience and knowledge is more based in straight and slightly wavy hair. \n\nA disclaimer – proper hair care can be time consuming and require lots of trial and error at first, it did for me and everyone who I know is really into it too, but in my opinion it is worth it. It doesn’t have to be pricy though, there are lots of great cheap products! Once you find what works for you though, you will really reap the benefits for life. \n\n\nSo, let’s start!\n\n\n**Finding out the true state of your hair**\n\nMost likely you use silicones on your hair (a lot of products contain them), and silicones coat your hair, make it soft, sometimes weigh it down. They cover a lot of hair care sins. To find out the true condition of your hair, you will need to strip it of silicones. To do this, you will need to use a shampoo with a fairly strong detergent, sodium laureth sulfate (SLES), sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), or sodium coco-sulfate are often shunned, however they are great for removing silicones from hair. You can then apply a non-silicone conditioner, and then wait for your hair to dry naturally. At this stage, you will see how good (or bad) a condition your hair is really like. It may still be looking great, but you may get quite a shock and decide you need quite the chop. I know I did the first time I cleansed my hair properly. It went from being fairly soft albeit a bit flat with just some split ends, to dry, tangled, and extremely brittle on the bottom 10cm. It looked matted. I took off a third of my length immediately and then a few months later another 5cm or so. I will edit this later once I find some before photos of my hair, and I will also do a current photo with my hair free of silicones.\n\n**Figuring out your hair porosity**\nHair porosity is your hair’s ability to absorb moisture. There is theoretically a simple test [here](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/40/3d/62/403d621b14f0c8c63e04ec9b61c02508.png) you can do, however over time you may find the result of it wasn’t 100%. I have medium porosity, meaning my hair absorbs moisture okay and keeps it for a decent amount of time. Low porosity hair doesn’t absorb moisture easily, however once it does, the moisture stays for a very long time. This can lead to product build up which will need to be cleansed regularly. Low porosity often requires using heat to absorb moisture (such as putting on a hair mask, a plastic shower cap and blowing hot air at it). High porosity hair absorbs moisture quickly, but it also lets it out quickly. Often requires good conditioning, but may also require cleansing from time to time. It will often feel frizzy, and humidity will have a big impact on high porosity hair. Unfortunately, you can’t really change the porosity of your hair, but you can definitely care for it! \n\n\n**Ingredients and Products**\n\nI have to say, compared to the east, the west has actually rather limited hair care options. Most high street and even salon brands are really not fantastic. I live in the UK, but I source most of my products from Eastern Europe, so for those of you in the US my specific recommendations might not be too much help, but you might be able to find some or find alternatives by looking at the ingredients list. \n\n**Ingredients**\n\nThere isn’t really a super easy way to go about this. After a year or so I learnt the names of ingredients that really work or don’t work for me and I look for or avoid them. [Here]( http://www.tightlycurly.com/ingredients/) is a good ingredients list which tells you what the ingredient is and what it is used for. It does also have a ‘good’ ‘okay’ ‘avoid’ rating system, however I wouldn’t necessarily take it into consideration, as how a lot of ingredients affect you is personal (for example some people’s hair responds well to sulfates or paraffin, others not so much). \n\nThe order of the ingredients list is not accidental. The further from the top, the less of that ingredient there is. Any beneficial ingredient listed after ‘parfum’ is not going to bring you any results, as it is basically a trace, however something that you are sensitive to can still have a negative effect on your scalp even at such trace amounts. \n\n*Things to look for*: \n\n*Oils* – any ingredient name that ends with oil (except mineral oil which is paraffin, more on this later!) is beneficial for hair. The more and the closer to the top of the list, the better, especially in masks and conditioners.\n\n*Extracts* – again any name that ends with extracts. These are extracts of naturally occurring plants, herbs, or even legumes which have different beneficial effects such as smoothing, adding shine, protecting or strengthening. \n\n*Emolients* – lanolin, anything with ‘butter’ (e.g. shea butter), cera alba (beeswax), pafarrinum liquidum (paraffin, more on this later)\n\n*Humectants* – glycerin, urea, mel (honey), aloe vera, fructose (sugars).\n\n*Antioxidants* – ascorbic acid (vit C), tocopherol (vit E), Ubiquinone (Q10), retinol/retinyl acelate/palmiatate (vit A), niacinamide (vit B3). \n\n*Proteins* – hydrolysed silk, hydrolysed keratin, hydrolysed wheat protein, hydrolysed oat protein. Proteins help to strengthen hair. \n\n*Soothing ingredients* – allantoin, arnica montana, calendula officinalis, panthenol. Particularly useful if you have a sensitive scalp.\n\n\n*What to avoid (generally speaking):*\n\n*Sulfates* – Sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, although if anything in the ingredients list of your shampoo ends with sulfate, check on the list for strength. Sulfates don’t always need to be avoided.  They are cleansers and foaming agents used in a large majority of shampoos. They can strip your hair of oils and humectants and dry the skin on your scalp, however they are also useful in the removal of silicones.  They shouldn’t be used every day, but once a week to every 2 weeks is recommended if you use silicones on your hair. If your scalp and roots respond well to sulfates, you can protect the lengths of your hair by applying an oil or conditioner pre-washing, thoroughly washing your scalp and roots with a sulfate shampoo and only using the leftover foam on the length, then conditioning again. There are more and less harsh versions, and the gentler ones can be used more frequently, please refer to ingredient list! Not recommended for curly hair.\n\n*Parabens and preservatives* – Ones I found particularly harmful to me personally: DMDM Hydantoin, 5-Bromo-5-Nitro-1,3-Dioxane, 2-Bromo-2-Nitropropane-1,3-Diol, Diazolidynyl Urea, Imidiazolidynyl Urea, Phenyl Benzoate, Phenyl Dimethicone, Formaldehyde, Methylchloroisothiazolinone. Parabens are used to prevent products from going off. They’re not the only preservatives used in hair care and by no means the worst ones, but they can affect your scalp and hair. Eco-shampoos and conditioners are often filled with alcohol instead of parabens which can really dry out your scalp and hair. I don’t find parabens to be bad for my hair at all, but this is personal and you will have to eliminate and reintroduce (see that thing I said about time consuming at the start?) to really find out. You will not be able to find a preservative free product, therefore it is worth checking which work for you. \n\n*Alcohol* – alcohol denat and isopropyl alcohol, most others are fatty alcohols which are moisturising. The only time harsh alcohols are useful is when using hair ‘rubs’, where they help with product absorption. \n\n*Scents* – most scenting ingredients are listed under parfum, however some particularly harsh ones are required to be listed separately. These are: limonene, linalool, citronellol, geraniol, coumarin, citral, benzyl benzoate and eugenol. They’re usually at the very end of the list and in the trace amounts will not usually do any harm unless you have a sensitivity. \n\n*Silicones* – similarly to sulfates, silicones are not always bad. I personally like silicones. They work with my hair without concealing its true condition much or weighing it down. If your hair is thin you may find it better to only use the more soluble ones or none at all.\nI avoid shampoos with silicones at all cost though. The job of a shampoo is to cleanse your hair and prepare it for absorption of beneficial ingredients. I allow water soluble and gentle shampoo soluble silicones in conditioners and hair masks, and I use SLS requiring silicones in leave in conditioners that I only put on the ends of my hair. \n\nWater soluble silicones are: dimethicone copolyol, lauryl methicone copolyol, hydrolyzed wheat protein hydroxypropyl polysiloxane and silicones with PEG and a number at the start. The higher the number (especially above 10), the more water soluble the silicone. \n\nSilicones soluble in mild shampoo: amodimethicone, dimethicone, dimethiconol, beheonoxy dimethicone, phenyl trimethicone.\n\nNeed sulfates: simethicone, trimethicone, trimethylsilylamodimethicone, trimethylsiloxysilicates.\n\nEvaporate from hair (only washing with a conditioner to become soluble): cyclometicone, cyclopentasiloxane, cyclotetrasiloxane, octamethyl cyclotetrasiloxane, cyclohexasiloxane.\n\nI would advise completely removing silicones from your hair care routine for a week (you might find out your hair curls when it never did before), and then slowly reintroducing them one by one from the mildest to the heaviest ones to see how your hair reacts.  \n\n*Paraffin*  - Mineral Oil, Paraffinum Liquidum, Paraffin Oil, white oil are most common names of Paraffin. Paraffin has made a bad name for itself, it is known to be comedogenic to skin, however this does not happen to everybody, and even then you don’t have to put it on your scalp. Paraffin can be found in conditioners, masks and hair oils, and I’ve never had problems with it as an ingredient. It is also found in a lot of baby products, as near enough no one is allergic to it. You will have to experiment to see how it works for you. If it agrees with your hair, it works much quicker than natural oils – you will see results from first use, rather than after months of regular use. Products containing paraffin can be used after washing and conditioning to protect your hair from split ends. Paraffin requires stronger cleansing agents such as SLS for removal, and therefore not recommended for curly hair. \n\n\n**Products**\n\nNow, let’s look at specific products and how to get the most of them. \n\n*Hair Oils*\nI cannot recommend hair oils enough. This is probably the number one thing that changed my hair. I have been using hair oils for 6+ years and have never looked back. I’ve tried A LOT of oils, and my favourite one is [khadi]( https://www.essentialslondon.com/products/hair-care/khadi-vitalising-hair-oil-100ml?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIuOPxmKHw1QIVCrftCh1njgn9EAQYAyABEgIwGPD_BwE#fo_c=762&fo_k=e4b0478aa27161be9771ad687e8f656d&fo_s=gplauk). It promotes hair growth and keeps my hair healthy and shiny, but some people don’t like the scent. Pure argan oil and rosehip oil are also great for me, as is pure coconut oil or the coconut hair oil from [vatika]( https://www.amazon.com/Dabur-Vatika-Enriched-Coconut-150ml/dp/B006BA3BAY/ref=pd_lpo_vtph_121_bs_t_1/136-1463637-2732606?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=B8H7QG82QJF78X98V78D). There are a lot of oils on the market, just make sure what you’re using is pure oil, not stuff like the brand ‘moroccan oil’ because even your cooking olive oil is better than that. You can find a lot of indian hair oils on amazon. Apply by taking a few droplets and warming them up in your palms, then rubbing into the scalp and the lengths of the hair. When I first started my hair care and my hair was quite damaged, I would apply oils overnight every other night (before washing), and sleep with a cotton hair cap on to prevent transfer onto my pillow, then wash it off and condition in the morning. I now wash my hair in the evenings, so I apply it for about an hour before washing and I find that’s enough, but my hair is not particularly damaged.\n\n*Shampoos*\n\nFor day to day cleansing I try to find as simple a shampoo as possible, such as this [Babydream]( https://www.codecheck.info/kosmetik_koerperpflege/babypflege/babyshampoo/ean_4305615272467/id_792172/Babydream_Shampoo_mit_Kamille.pro). I’ve tried other ones over the years, but always come back to this one as it’s super cheap and gentle. I also like [Equilibria aloe vera shampoo]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,51609,equilibra-aloe-shampoo.html). Other products that I’ve used as a shampoo that aren’t a shampoo: [Facelle intimate wash]( http://www.rossmann.pl/Produkt/Facelle-intim-plyn-do-higieny-intymnej-Sensitive-300-ml,101735,7210), [Johnson’s Baby 3in1 Wash]( http://www.johnsonsbaby.com.pl/johnsons-baby-%C5%82agodny-p%C5%82yn-do-mycia-cia%C5%82a-i-w%C5%82os%C3%B3w-3w1). At the start I found my hair a bit tangled after use, but I think that was partly due to the damage. For heavier cleansing I use [Avalon organics rosemary]( https://www.amazon.co.uk/Avalon-Organics-Rosemary-Volumizing-Shampoo/dp/B001ET78QU) or any of the herbal [Barwa Natura]( https://www.barwa.com.pl/seria/barwa-naturalna/) shampoos. I do this every 10-14 days depending on how my hair feels regarding silicones and paraffin that I’ve used. A special mention goes to [Babuszka Agafia Black Soap]( https://bioika.pl/pl/p/Naturalne-Syberyjskie-Czarne-Mydlo-Agafii-na-bazie-37-ziol/659) which is just amazing. \n\n*Conditioners*\n\nI like to go rich here. I look for alllll of the extracts, oils, humectants, anything and everything. My everyday conditioner is the [Garnier avocado and shea butter]( https://www.fragrancedirect.co.uk/garnier-ultimate-blends-the-nourishing-repairer-conditioner-0083190.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=merchant&utm_keyword=foo&istCompanyId=17773c4e-a26f-4631-9b91-73e6422dbe77&istItemId=xiqwpwpqil&istBid=tztx&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9Oud06Lw1QIVxbztCh0PbQzcEAkYASABEgI4UfD_BwE) and it’s been with me for years. I also like the [seboradin ginseng conditioner]( https://seboradin.pl/en/seboradin-revitalizing/29-lotion-seboradin-revitalizing.html), Nivea Long Repair, [Balea Coconut and Milk](http://lepotica.rs/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/balea-mleko-za-telo-lepotica.jpg) and [Timotei Precious Oils]( https://www.amazon.com/Timotei-Precious-Oil-Hair-Conditioner/dp/B00UGHRW6M). Currently I apply in-shower for however long it takes me to shave and wash, then rinse off. When my hair was damaged, I would put a cap on and leave them on for 30 mins, then rinse.\n\n*Masks*\n\nAs with conditioners, as many of the goodies as possible. This is probably the product I’ve switched up the most, as there are not very many BAD hair masks, usually they’re between average and amazing. My favourites over the years have been [Alterra]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,43114,haarkur-granatapfel-aloe-vera.html), [Natur Vital aloe vera]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,40836,naturvital-sensitive-hair-mask-aloe-vera-juniper-zimbro.html) mask, [biovax masks such as this]( https://www.amazon.co.uk/LBiotica-Biovax-Damaged-Hair-250ml/dp/B00N42XUL2), [Babuszka Agafia yeast mask]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,51660,pervoe-reshenie-przepisy-babci-agafii-maska-do-wlosow-drozdzowa-na-pobudzenie-wzrostu.html) and [Kallos Latte]( https://www.notino.co.uk/kallos/serical-mask-for-damaged-chemically-treated-hair/?item=78561&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIqp7vxKPw1QIVbb7tCh2u0QGcEAQYASABEgKtzPD_BwE) mask. I used to apply masks twice a week, but now I do it weekly or even every 10 days. Usually I will apply a mask instead of conditioner, throw on a shower cap, and keep it on for anywhere between 1 and 3 hours before rinsing. Sometimes I will blow warm air from the hairdryer to help the ingredients absorb better.\n\n*Rinses*\n\nThere are many rinses you can make at home, not really available as products to buy. I like a chamomile rinse the best as I’m blonde, I also like a dissolved aloe one, but you can experiment with ingredients recommended for your hair type. They can strengthen your hair, add shine, reduce frizz, make it sleeker.\n\n*Rubs*\n\nThese are products that you rub into your scalp and roots (and sometimes hair length) without rinsing off. My favourite is from [Jantar]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,69415,jantar-odzywka-do-wlosow-i-skory-glowy-nowa-wersja.html), I also like [Joanna Rzepa]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,17640,rzepa-kuracja-wzmacniajaca.html). There are also placenta capsules after which I got an insane amount of baby hair. Rubs help with growth and strength of hair!\n\n*Hair protection*\n\nI use something with silicones and proteins in to protect my end, usually the silk from [biovax]( http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/like/112353278842?chn=ps&dispItem=1&adgroupid=44158024220&rlsatarget=pla-324287136906&abcId=1128926&adtype=pla&merchantid=115212699&poi=&googleloc=1007281&device=c&campaignid=856227250&crdt=0), but some hair oils (especially coconut) will also do. I do this once my hair is at least half dry and leave it in. If I’m not washing my hair for longer than 2 days, I will reapply. \n\n*Vitamins, Supplements etc.*\n\nThere are a lot of supplements you can try to help your hair growth or its condition. Vitamin E is obviously a staple. Biotin is fantastic for hair growth. Pregnancy vitamins strengthen hair. Drinking nettle and horsetail tea will do wonders. If you are really, really adventurous and can stomach a lot, drinking yeast (fresh is best, but dry will do) is the best for hair growth. You need to drink it every day for a prolonged period of time though, and it is incredibly unpleasant so requires a lot of commitment.\n\n*Hair styling and others*\n\nAs you might have seen from my previous post, I don’t often style my hair, and have never done. I do hairdry on cold or lukewarm settings, but I only use heat stylers for events and I chuck in a lot of hair protection. I’m gonna experiment a little with styling after my most recent post, but after looking for styling products, I’ve found very few that are not harmful to hair. I don’t brush my hair wet unless using the wet brush, I have a cotton tshirt I use to absorb water from it with instead of a towel, I don’t sleep with it wet, I keep it in a loose twisted bun overnight mostly to avoid rubbing. I have 3 different hair brushes (sable and synthetic) and a tangle teezer. If it’s very windy, I plait my hair, and I wear a hat in the sun. I wear a cap to go swimming. \n\n\nWell done if you got to the end, you are a hero. I hope you find these tips useful and can pick and mix as you please! Give most products 3-4 weeks to do their work before you deem them useless though. Looking forward to any tips you ladies might have on hair care, discussion, and what you found works for you and if you’re as obsessive as I am about it! \n\n\nEdit: link with some [hair photos](https://imgur.com/a/CQU90), 6 year difference",

    "body": "23 year old male. Started noticing hair loss around 2 years ago but never really gave it that much importance. Figured it was bound to happen anyway (saw it happen to my father and my older brother). I should also mention that I've been using regular cheap shampoos my entire life. Some time around October last year, I was shopping for a new shampoo bottle when I stumbled upon a Clear shampoo bottle that said \"Anti Hair Fall - Nutrium 10\". Alrighty then, looks good enough. First time using it my scalp was itching so hard, I thought \"oh lolol must be the anti-hairfall stuff working its magic\". It also seemed to make my hair really dry and frizzy (by stripping it of all its natural oils I guess). Over the next few weeks, my scalp seemed to get used to it and there was no more itching after showers. \n\nToday I saw a 6 months old picture of myself, and then looked at myself in the mirror. I was shocked. I realized that not only the shampoo wasn't working, but it might have been actually making it worse. After 2 hours of furious googling and reading about shampoo ingredients, I found out that this one had a lot of bad stuff in it: Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Dimethiconol, Peg-4, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium sorbate, Propylene glycol... So I ran to our town's supermarket and spent another hour reading the backs of shampoo bottles.. Apparently out of the 10 available brands, only Johnson's baby shampoo wasn't as bad as the stuff I've been using. It's my only option for now until I can maybe talk to a specialist or visit a bigger supermarket. And no, I can't order something from the sidebar online because I live in a third world country where you're not allowed to buy stuff online... Sigh..\n\nWhy did I post this? I honestly don't know.. I've just felt like sharing. I was very mad at first, and now I'm just depressed. I feel like I've neglected my hair for so long and now the damage is probably beyond repair. Take it as a PSA.. Don't just buy a shampoo because it says it does something on the front of the bottle. Check the ingredients, read about them, and read online reviews if you can find any. \n\nA few articles about the ingredients you should avoid:\n\n[Article 1](http://naturalhaireverything.tumblr.com/post/3253973196/10-ingredients-to-avoid-putting-on-your-hair)\n\n[Article 2](http://www.epochinspired.com/inspired/1093460-17-harmful-shampoo-ingredients-to-avoid/)\n\n[Article 3](http://livelovefruit.com/12-toxic-ingredients-to-avoid-in-shampoo/)",

        "body": "If you noticed your hair started thinning two years ago, I hate to break it to you, but it may be worse over 6 months on its own and not due to the shampoo. \n\nIf it was from the shampoo, however, the good news is that it's likely to just be excess shedding due to the irritants aggravating your scalp, something of which the intense itching was likely a symptom, so the healthy follicles you still have will produce new hairs again in time. \n\nHowever, male pattern baldness occurs as the follicles (think of them like the little holes in your scalp that the hairs grow out of) begin to die and no longer grow hair. If the shampoo caused hair shed, unfortunately, the follicles that were dying may not regrow hair as the next phase in the hair cycle begins. \n\nIf you're concerned about your hair continuing to thin, now would be the time to start using a product like Rogaine. It won't grow hair from the follicles that have already died, but it will help out the ones that have been on their way out, and it can also help to slow down the overall thinning process.",

    "body": "Hey y'all. New guy here. A couple of days ago I read the intro to CG and went straight ahead to a store to find the right products to start using the CG method. Turns out, I had no clear idea of what to go for, since many ingredient's names had no sense for me. Were they alchohol? Silicones? Maybe both of them? Since there's no signal inside the stores, I couldn't even use the ingredients bot.\n\nI got out and checked reddit back and found the holy list of products... except there's an extreme lack of content in the italian list. Having no idea about what to buy, I went back home and started reading more on the wiki. After reading a good amount of articles, I wrote a guide for myself, so I can understand if a product should be the one I need or not. Might as well share it here.\n\nBeing the guide to myself, it's made in my native language (italian). I could make a translation, but you'd notice that it's no more than the content of a couple of wiki pages summarized, so I think it would still be a good idea to go read those, since they're surely better written than mine. Aside from that, in this guide there's the full content of the intro, with all the explanations of all the techinques added (SOTC, Plopping etc.), a list of all the main ingredients you should find on a product, understanding what is nice to have and what should be avoided (among alchohols, silicones and humettants), some dedication about porosity and how to care for your curles during sleep and when you don't wash them. This should hopefully help any italian who gets here to fill the holy list of italian products easily. There you go:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrima di cominciare, leggerai diverse volte il termine \"sgranocchiare\". Si intende tamponare gentilmente i capelli partendo dalle punte, alzando le ciocche fino alla cute, quindi strizzare.\n\nRoutine per lavare i capelli \\[le tecniche in parentesi quadra sono opzionali\\]:\n\n\\- **Reset shampoo** (solo una volta. Solfati, no siliconi) \\[se possibile V05 clarifying, ma va' bene  anche uno della linea Ultra dolce (es. quello alle 5 erbe) o Fructis (es. il Cucumber Fresh) della Garnier. (da riusare non più di una volta al mese)\n\n\\- **Balsamo** (no solfati, no siliconi). Non aver paura di abbondare. Pettina i capelli con il balsamo ancora in testa.\n\n\\- **Sciacqua** via il balsamo, continuando a massaggiare. Puoi valutare di lasciare un po' di balsamo in testa\n\n\\[S2C\\]: dopo il balsamo, aggiungi porzioni d'acqua come se fossero un prodotto. Strizza l'acqua nei capelli per sciacquare poi via il balsamo.\n\n\\- Prendi molto **gel** (no solfati, no siliconi, no alcol) e usalo sui capelli ancora bagnati\n\n\\- **Asciuga** \"sgranocchiando\" con una maglietta in cotone o asciugamano in microfibra. Asciuga col diffusore da lontano, temperatura media.\n\nPer aumentare il volume, puoi mettere dei fermagli sulle radici dei capelli.\n\n\\[Plopping\\]: appoggia una maglietta in cotone su un mobile. Appoggia la fronte sulla maglietta. Lega la maglietta attorno alla testa e solleva nuovamente la testa.\n\nDopo 10 minuti, leva la maglietta e usala per asciugare \"sgranocchiando\" i capelli.\n\n\\- **A capelli asciutti**. \"sgranocchia via\" la \"croccantezza\" causata dal gel, con le mani\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[SOTC\\]: se i capelli risultano crespi, puoi aggiungere un olio, massaggiando dalla punta verso la radice, quando i capelli sono perfettamente asciutti.\n\n\\[Super Soaker\\]: usa tutti i prodotti insieme. Sciacqua usando poca acqua alla volta.\n\n\\[Finger coiling\\]: definisci i ricci applicando il prodotto riccio per riccio. Avvolgilo intorno alle dita e ripeti con il riccio successivo.\n\n\\[LOC\\]: utile sui ricci annodati. Prevede l'utilizzo di balsamo, olio e crema, nell'ordine che ho scritto\n\n\\[Rake & Shake\\]:  dividi i capelli in ciocche e applica i prodotti sulle lunghezze pettinando i capelli con le dita. Una volta alle punte, afferra la  ciocca e agitala per \"riattivare\" i ricci.\n\n\\[Shingling\\]: dividi la testa in 5-6 sezioni e focalizzati su una alla volta, applicando il prodotto aiutandoti col pettine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Alcol:**\n\nAlcuni alcol sono totalmente da evitare (Ethanol alcohol, Ethyl alcohol, Propanol alcohol, Alcohol denat., Isopropyl alcohol, Isopropanol alcohol, Benzyl alcohol)\n\nAltri sono permessi, in quanto non causano danni. Anzi, possono addirittura portare benefici (Cetyl alcohol, Cetearyl alcohol, Stearyl alcohol, Lauryl alcohol)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Siliconi:**\n\nSon divisi in categorie. Alcuni di questi possono essere presenti senza problemi, altri meno perchè possono accumularsi. Oltre ad accumularsi, comunque, portano benefici vari.\n\n1. Evaporativi. Evaporano nel giro di due ore al massimo, quindi non si accumulano.\n\n\\- Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane, Hexamethyldisiloxane, Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, cyclomethicone (quest’ultimo e altri ciclo-XXX-silosani non sono solubili in acqua, ma evaporano comunque rapidamente, quindi non sono un problema)\n\n2) Facili da lavare. Non evaporano e possono essere presenti nel balsamo. Alcuni di questi, però, possono essere resistenti all'acqua (specie se calda) e potrebbero richiedere uno shampoo coi solfati perchè vengano rimossi.\n\n\\- Methicone e Dimethicone e Dimethicone copolyol (buoni se non hanno ingredienti cationici),silica, silequioxanes, siloxysilicates (es. diisostearoyl trimethylolpropane siloxysilicate) (questi sono pesanti),diphenyl dimethicone, dimethiconol, disiloxane, Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane, Lauryl methicone copolyol, Phenyltrimethicone, Trisiloxane\n\n3) Difficili da lavare, ma non si accumulano. Si accumula solo in un primo strato. Gli strati successivi eliminano i precedenti, quindi l’accumulo non è troppo. È comunque meglio evitarli, se possibile.\n\nDimethicone crosspolymer, Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer, Aminopropyltriethoxysilane, Aminopropyl Dimethicone (senza surfatante cationico), Amodimethicone (senza surfatante cationico), Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone, Dimethicone, Dimethicone PEG/PPG, o -dimethylsiloxane, in presenza di un altro catione polimerico come bromuri, cloruri o polyquaterni.\n\n4) Difficili da lavare, si accumulano. Da evitare totalmente. Per essere rimossi si richiede l’uso ripetuto di shampoo con solfati.\n\nBehenoxy dimethicone, Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone, Cetyl dimethicone, Cetearyl methicone, Dimethiconol hydroxystearate, Polysilicone-18 Cetyl Phosphate, Propyl Dimethicone, Stearoxy dimethicone, Stearyl dimethicone, Stearyl methicone Trimethylsiylamodimethicone\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Umettanti:**\n\nDa evitare in zone calde e umide, in quanto tendono ad assorbire troppo e rendere i capelli troppo secchi.\n\nGlycerin, Propylene Glycol, Honey, Agave nectar, Sorbitol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed silk protein, Fructose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Come trattare i ricci nei giorni in cui non li lavi:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dormi con i capelli avvolti** in una sciarpa in seta, oppure legali in modo da formare una coda partendo dalla cima della testa (metodo ananas)\n\nSe hai i capelli molto lunghi, puoi fare trecce.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ogni giorno** puoi trattare i tuoi capelli in più possibili modi, a seconda dell'umidità dell'ambiente in cui vivi e la porosità dei ricci:\n\n0) Bagna completamente i capelli, aggiungi un po' di balsamo (eventualmente S2C) e gel. Praticamente lavali di nuovo.\n\n1. Usa uno spray per spruzzare il balsamo (o anche solo acqua) per inumidire, poi \"sgranocchia\" un po' i ricci.\n2. Bagnati le mani con gel diluito, oppure balsamo diluito, oppure anche solo acqua, e \"sgranocchia\"\n3. Valido se hai tempo per asciugarti bene e se hai capelli corti; prendi l'acqua con le mani e \"sgranocchia\" le punte, eventualmente aggiungendo un po' di gel, poi asciuga (eventualmente plopping)\n4. Cerca una sezione particolarmente crespa, bagna le mani, aggiungi una goccia di gel e applicalo sulla sezione (eventualmente finger coiling). \"Sgranocchia\" tutti i ricci un po' in generale.\n5. Agita i ricci e \"sgranocchia\" mentre sei a testa in giù. Puoi anche incasinare i capelli un po' ma evita di far passare le dita lungo i ricci o rischi di fare un disastro.\n\nIn particolare, quando fai attività sportiva, è una buona idea usare un po' di balsamo, ed eventualmente sostituire il gel con creme per ricci.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Porosità:**\n\nI capelli possono in genere avere bassa, media o alta porosità.\n\nQuesti due link sono i modi migliori per identificare la porosità dei capelli: [https://www.curlsbot.com/porosity/](https://www.curlsbot.com/porosity/)\n\nOppure  [http://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/hair-porosity-how-to-measure-sort-of.html](http://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/hair-porosity-how-to-measure-sort-of.html)\n\nBassa porosità:\n\nI capelli impiegano più di 2 secondi a bagnarsi, anche sotto il getto diretto dell'acqua\n\nL'acqua rimane sopra i capelli invece che bagnarli\n\nI prodotti non vengono ben assorbiti, perciò si accumulano di più in mezzo ai capelli\n\nI capelli impiegano molto a seccarsi\n\nI capelli sono più resistenti a trattamenti chimici (come il colore)\n\n\\- Lavali sempre con acqua calda\n\n\\- Usa gli heating cap\n\n\\- Metti i capelli in una cuffietta per la doccia in plastica e usa un asciugamano riscaldato\n\n\\- Usa prodotti più leggeri, specialmente se usi gli oli, in quanto tenderanno ad appesantire molto i capelli. (Oli leggeri: jojoba, argan/argania, grapeseed/semi d'uva, sunflower/girasole, sweet almond/mandorle dolci). Eventualmente non usare affatto gli oli.\n\n\\- Usa con una certa regolarità un prodotto che elimini gli accumuli sui capelli. Il prodotto dev'essere un po' aggressivo ma non quanto un comunque shampoo.\n\nAlta porosità:\n\nSi bagnano immediatamente anche con poca acqua\n\nI capelli assorbono rapidamente qualunque cosa\n\nI capelli si asciugano velocemente dopo essere stati lavati\n\nAccettano facilmente prodotti chimici (come il colore), ma possono espellerlo altrettanto facilmente.\n\nPossono sembrare pesanti e secchi\n\nSi annodano facilmente\n\nTendono a essere crespi\n\n\\- Usa oli pesanti (castor/ricino, olive, coconut/cocco, flax/lino, hemp/canapa, jamaican black castor/ricino nero giamaicano) e oli che chiudono le cuticole.\n\n\\- Usa settimanalmente una maschera per capelli\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Altre generalità:**\n\nGli ingredienti principali di cui tenere conto sono: solfati, siliconi, polyquats, umettanti cocco. proteine, (in genere i capelli tendono ad accettare o rifiutare gli ultimi due tipi di ingredienti). Evita il calore diretto e i prodotti Pantene.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConsigli da u/GIUlianab\n\nSe vuoi provare a seguire il CG per adesso prova a guardare tra i prodotti Omia e de I Provenzali, dovrebbero avere almeno balsami e maschere senza  siliconi (le maschere della Omia sono buone) e shampoo senza solfati e siliconi. Io personalmente sconsiglio il co-washing, specialmente se  vivi in un luogo con acqua molto dura. Usare uno shampoo delicato (senza solfati o con questi in basso nella lista degli ingredienti, in quanto dovrebbe indicarne una bassa quantità) è sempre meglio secondo me.\n\nLa Biopoint di recente ha lanciato una linea senza siliconi, solfati e  parabeni, se la trovi ed è nel tuo budget puoi provarla, la Garnier ha lanciato le maschere hair food (solo non lasciarle agire per un minuto, non fanno una cippa in un minuto) e se non sbaglio il balsamo Splend'Or è  CG. \n\nQuello che per me ha funzionato davvero è stato usare una vecchia  magliette di cotone per asciugare e plopping, mettere una stoffa di raso sopra il mio cuscino quando dormo, dormire con \"l'ananas\", lo S2C, lo  scrunching e applicare tutti i prodotti sui capelli gocciolanti.",

If you are straightening/curling, apply a heat protectant that is a dry spray (like a hairspray, not a spritz). I HIGHLY recommend Paul Mitchell Hot off the Press. You can purchase it on Amazon.\n\nProfessional products are expensive. Believe me, I know 😅 But the quality truly is worth it. You are paying for more, high quality ingredients.\n\nThat Aussie product that advertises jojoba oil can have 1 drop of oil in it for them to be able to market the benefits.\n\nI would also suggest switching to a higher quality shampoo. You will find that you’re able to wash your hair less frequently, and go longer between washes. Check with local salons too that may have left over gift sets (always a good deal) Local Cosmetology Schools typically have product specials as well.\n\nInvest in a quality shampoo, conditioner, heat protectant, and serum. 4 products and your hair will thank you 💝",

It lubricates the hair and is thought to contribute to easier wet combing (i.e less friction). In hair serum, for thermal processing, dimethicone is a heat protectant. Shampoos with sulfates are ideal for removing products with dimethicone. ([via.](http://www.thenaturalhavenbloom.com/search/label/Ingredients%20Dictionary)) Generally speaking, silicones build up on the hair and can only be adequately removed with sulfates. Sulfates are extremely drying to the hair, and can cause a whole host of problems with hair health. It is best to avoid silicones in hair care, so as to avoid sulfates in hair care. \n\nIn skincare, it prevents water loss by forming a hydrating barrier on the skin. Like most silicones, this ingredient has a unique fluidity that makes it easily spreadable. When applied to the skin, its known for creating a subtle gloss that feels smooth and silky to touch. It also acts a mild water repellent by forming a protective barrier on the skin, and can fill in fine lines/wrinkles on the face, giving it a temporary “plump” look. ([via.](http://www.truthinaging.com/ingredients/dimethicone)) Because silicones sit on top of the skin, they can trap dirt, bacteria, etc. and cause breakouts. \n\nSilicones are not readily biodegradable, so they can have negative impacts when they are washed down the drain. However, many waste-water treatment methods and systems are capable of filtering out silicones.",

        "body": "I would suggest just using the recommended usage rates from your seller. Glycerin gets sticky fast so use 5% at most. I would keep the ethylhexylglycerin, it helps with stickiness and just makes the formula feel nicer in my experience. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou can use something like Sodium Carbomer from Lotioncrafter as the basis of your gel. That one is easier because it's already been neutralized. Then add your humectants like the glycerin and HA plus you can add butylene or propylene glycol as well as substitute some of the water for aloe if you want additional hydration.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe phenoxyethanol is the preservative, just use any preservative at the recommended usage rate. Germaben II or German Plus are good ones. The dimethicone is what makes this product more than an HA gel and more of a product that you can use as an actual moisturizer, the silicones help create a barrier so moisture can't escape. Silicones also make products feel nicer. You can skip it if you want a really easy recipe but if you want something just like the Neutrogena you'll want to keep it, you'll just need an emulsifier. POI generally recommends BTMS for emulsifying products heavy in silicones. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you're relatively new, you may be best tweaking [this](swiftcraftymonkey.blogspot.com/2015/02/making-water-in-silicone-serum-with.html?m=1) recipe from POI. It's a water in silicone serum that is gel like according to her, you'd just be adding in the humectants to the Lotioncrafter serum base. This would be more siliconey than the Neutrogena though.",

The packaging is sleek and attractive, making it easy to carry in your bag for quick touch-ups. The formula itself is lightweight and doesn't leave a heavy residue, which is a major plus. It effectively absorbs oil and adds volume to limp hair, giving it a refreshed and clean look. However, it may not be as effective on very oily hair, and you might need to reapply throughout the day. The scent is light and pleasant, but it can be a bit strong for those sensitive to fragrances.\n\nPros:\n- Affordable\n- Lightweight formula\n- Adds volume\n- Pleasant scent\n\nCons:\n- May need reapplication\n- Not as effective on very oily hair\n- Scent might be strong for some\n\nWNRP\n\n2. Kristin Ess Style Reviving Dry Shampoo\n\nIngredients:\nIsobutane, Propane, Alcohol Denat., Dimethylimidazolidinone Rice Starch, Fragrance (Parfum), Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Benzoate, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Hydroxycitronellal, Limonene, Linalool.\n\nReview:\nKristin Ess Style Reviving Dry Shampoo excels in absorbing oil and refreshing hair without leaving a white cast, making it suitable for all hair colors. The formula is enriched with ingredients that help to extend the life of your style and add texture without feeling gritty. The scent is a luxurious floral fragrance that lingers subtly throughout the day. It also offers a nice boost of volume, making it perfect for those days when your hair needs a little extra lift. The only downside is that it is on the pricier side compared to other dry shampoos. May not work for very oily hair.\n\nPros:\n- No white residue\n- Extends style life\n- Adds volume and texture\n- Luxurious scent\n\nCons:\n- More expensive \n- Not as effective on very oily hair\n- Scent may be strong for some\n\nWNRP\n\n3. Redken Deep Clean Dry Shampoo\n\nIngredients:\nIsobutane, Alcohol Denat., Propane, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Calcium Carbonate, Polyvinylcaprolactam, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Dimethicone, Dimethiconol, Linalool, Citronellol, Benzyl Salicylate, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Coumarin, Benzyl Alcohol, Parfum/Fragrance.\n\nReview:\nRedken Deep Clean Dry Shampoo is a powerhouse for those who need a heavy-duty product. It’s formulated to tackle even the oiliest of hair, providing a deep clean that extends the time between washes. This dry shampoo leaves hair feeling genuinely clean without the typical dry shampoo residue. It has a neutral scent that is not overpowering, making it suitable for those sensitive to fragrances. While effective, it can sometimes leave hair feeling a bit dry, so it’s best used in moderation or paired with a moisturizing product.\n\nPros:\n- Excellent for very oily hair\n- Provides a deep clean\n- Neutral scent\n- Professional packaging\n\nCons:\n- Can leave hair feeling dry\n- Best used in moderation\n- Very costly for the quantity \n\nWRP",

    "body": "So I was oiling my beard when I thought \"hey, instead of mixing argan treatment and jojoba oil in my hand, why don't I just pre-mix it in the bottle?\" I took my bottle of pure jojoba oil, which was 75-80% full, and topped it off with some of the argan oil treatment. Well, that might not have been my best recipe. A pale precipitate formed almost immediately. I shake and shake and it won't dissolve, so I leave it alone for a bit. Most of it floats to the top and gels together into one rubbery blob. [Here's what a bit of it looked like when I removed it from the bottle.](http://imgur.com/SOWVvVD) It's very soft and elastic and judging by how messy it is, it either contains a lot of oil trapped inside or melts in my hands. The precipitate made up about 5-10% of the total volume of the bottle and thus 20-50% of the volume of the added argan oil treatment. Here's the list of the ingredients for the treatment:\n\n* Cyclopentasiloxane\n* Dimethiconol\n* Cyclomethicone\n* C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate\n* Argan oil (yeah, they really don't give you much argan oil for your money)\n* Linseed oil\n* Fragrances and colors (Red 17, Yellow 11)\n\nSince the product of the reaction is elastic and has a non-negligible volume, I assume it's one of the first few silicone-based ingredients in the argan oil treatment that reacted with my jojoba oil, which contains long-chain wax esters [according to Wikipedia.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jojoba)\n\nSo, my questions are:\n\n1. What reacted with the jojoba oil?\n2. What reaction occurred? (I haven't seen a chemistry classroom in years, so my only guess is esterification based on the fact that jojoba contains esters.)\n3. What is this product I accidentally created?\n4. Were any other products created in the process and is it safe to use the remainder of the jojoba-argan treatment?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

        "body": "I don't think a reaction happened. The argan oil treatment is a complex mixture of oils and poly- siloxanes. The mixture is probably a carefully formulated stable (semi-stable) emulsion. The pure jojoba oil probably disrupted the emulsion and forced the more polar siloxanes to precipitate. These siloxanes are polymers that may have elastomeric properties and appear as gels when \"wetted\" with a liquid/oil.\n\nTry half-filling some test-tubes (shot-glasses?) with some different 'solvents': water, acetone (nail-polish remover), ethanol (highest proof vodka) veggie oil and add a couple/few drops of the argan oil mixture and observe the differences. You may see slight changes in the precipitate.\n\nTo directly answer your questions:\n1. No chemical reaction\n2. Probably broke the emulsion\n3. No new product formation, just observation of gel precipitate. The precipitate may be one of the polymers (i.e. the longest chain) or a mixture of the siloxanes.\n4. The mixture should be just as safe as it was, but messy! I wouldn't use it and it would be pretty hard to make a stable emulsion again.\n\nFollow up: Have you listed all of the ingredients (there is no water?) in the argan formula? Does the bottle direct to shake before use?",

It gives me that healthy and radiant glow to my skin. I almost resisted putting on a moisturizer and night cream due to the moistness it provided to my face.\nHowever, the effect only lasted for 2-3 days but I'm sure with constant use, my skin will continue to improve.\n\nOVERALL:\nThis mask evened out my skin tone and made my face look plump. It also deeply moisturized my skin and provides a cooling sensation to it. The mask is good for pampering yourself after having a hectic day, preferably during night time. I recommend this mask to anyone with dry skin and also to those looking for a 2-in-1 mask (soothing+hydrating).\n\nRATING:\n8/10",

As the price was on the higher side, I waited for discount offers following which, I was finally able to get my hands on it. \n\nOn first application, the texture felt thicker and easy to spread while massaging on face, but it settled nicely on skin. I was pretty impressed with it, but then I read on this sub how Isntree products have to be finished eithin 6 months of opening, and I had an Isntree emulsion luing around, so I decided to finish it first and Put Neutrogena on hold assuming it will survive as it was newly brought & had time before its expiry. \n\nHere's where things started to go wrong. When I started using Neutrogena back after a few weeks, It was still easy to spread, but it pilled. At first, I blamed the sunscreen for it but when it repeated for a different sunscreen, I realised the problem is in the face cream. \n\nNo matter what I tried, Immediate application of sunscreen after face cream or waiting a while, it always pilled. Finally, one day, I kept the face cream in the frige for 24 hours hoping to see some improvement. \n\nThere was improvement, i.e. the pilling didn't stop, but reduced drastically. It was bearable for a week after which, the pillong started.\n\nNo prizes to imagine my disappointment over a brand like Neutrogena letting down by teaching me that even face cream can pill.\n\n**WRP:** WNRP.",

    "body": "My hands always get dry in the winter, but this year I am taking a medication that acts as a vasoconstrictor and my already terrible circulation is struggling to get any liquid out to my extremities. Less tissue perfusion=drier skin. Even things that were reliable stand-bys while I was on Accutane (Eucerin, lanolin, keeping lotion within reach at all times) are no match for my winter Adderal hand dryness. So I have resorted to hand masking. It’s expensive IMO, even buying the cheaper hand masks and giving some side eye to $9 Sephora masks. But I’m desperate! I couldn't find many reviews for hand masks, so I thought I'd start offering mine. Here are little reviews of the four I have tried so far, from the most to least hydrating.    \nHere’s the TL; DR summary: the Absolute are the most moisturizing and the only one that isn’t scented like cheap grandma perfume, but the Smart Hand Milky Moisture are a bargain at half the price and the only ones with a built in adhesive tab to adjust them to your wrists. Tip: for ones without a built in sticky tab, you can use a hair tie around your wrist more easily than scotch taping once you are gloved.\n\n\n**Absolute New York Repair and Care Hand Mask in Tangerine**    \n**Purchased:** Hmart on sale for $3, regular price $4    \n**Ingredients:** Tangerine Water, Glycerin, PEG-8, Mineral Oil, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Sodium Hyaluronate, PEG-40 Stearate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Stearic Acid, Arbutin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Paraffin, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Triethanolamine, Tangerine Extract, Olive Fruit Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Lycium Chinese Fruit Extract, Thuja Orientalis Seed Extract, Soybean Seed Extract, Swertia Japonica Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Carbomer, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA Hand Mask – Rose Water, Glycerin, PEG-8, Mineral Oil, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Sodium Hyaluronate, PEG-40 Stearate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Stearic Acid, Arbutin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Paraffin, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Triethanolamine, Rose Extract, Olive Fruit Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Lycium Chinese Fruit Extract, Thuja Orientalis Seed Extract, Soybean Seed Extract, Swertia Japonica Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Carbomer, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA    \n**Thoughts:** This one has a strong tangerine scent, no surprise. I was worried the tangerine would be irritating, but it seemed fine. This mask was so effective at moisturizing my sad parched hand that it convinced me to try the others. My Hmart only had this version, but it comes in rose, green tea, and black pearl, all identical formulas except for the main extract and fragrance.\n\n**Repiel Smart Hand Mask Milky Moisture**     \n**Purchase:** Amazon, box of 10 for $20, even cheaper on ebay    \nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Urea, Glyceryl Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Propylene Glycol, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1.2-Hexanediol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Illicium Verum(Anise)Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Fragrance, Carbomer, Arginine, Milk Protein Extract, Goat Milk Extract, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Allantoin, Adenosine, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hyaluronate    \nThoughts: The standard scent for hand masks appears to be cheap grandma perfume: powdery, soapy floral smell. Except for the first tangerine one, these all smell like grandma in varying degrees. These ones have a medium strength scent that blessedly doesn’t linger. The essence in these is not quite as moisturizing as the Absolute ones, but it’s still good. Annoyingly, it’s not well distributed, at least in the box I got--it’s concentrated in the fingers but the thumb of the gloves doesn’t ever seem to have any, so I have to squish it down into the hand part and then squish my hand around in them for a minute to get the essence properly distributed. What I do like about these is that they have a built in adhesive tab at the wrist. So, after you get them on, you can easily tape them closed tight at the wrist to seal in that moisture goodness. At about half the price of the Absolute, it’s pretty easy to forgive the failings.\n\n**Skin Food Shea Butter Hand Mask**    \n**Purchased:** Ebay for around $3.50    \n**Ingredients:** Water, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter Extract, Dimethicone, Butylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Glycerin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Cyclopentasiloxane, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Honey Extract, Milk Protein Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Arginine, Disodium Edta, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance    \n**Experience:** I was sooo disappointed that these smelled like grandma, because I expected a pleasant shea butter smell. They don’t smell like shea butter at all, and the moistuzing power is so-so. They also have alcohol pretty high in the ingredients list, which doesn’t impress me in skincare, and even less in something meant to moisturize. \n\n\n**The Face Shop Rich Hand V Special Care**    \n**Purchased:** Ebay for around $3.50    \n**Ingredients:** Water, dimethicone, butylene glycol, glycerin, caprylic/capric triglyceride, citrus paradis (grapefruit) extract, glyceryl sterate, peg-100 sterate, urea, cetearyl alcohol, alcohol, sorbitan sesquioleate, cyclopentasiloxane, sodium polyacrylate, acrylates/C10-20 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, hydrogenated polydecene, potassium hydroxide, dimethiconol, adenosine, trideceth-6, disodium edta, phenoxyethanol, fragrance    \n**Experience:** These have a much milder grandma scent than the others, further mitigated with a pleasant base note of shea or cocoa butter smell, which is weird since they don’t contain either. They were the juiciest feeling hand mask I tried, and I had high hopes for them. Unfortunately, they did virtually nothing. I was honestly amazed at how ineffectual these were for moisturizing, and I can only guess the difference between this and the other masks I tried is due to the dimethicone so high in the ingredients list and lack of more effective moisturizing oil, at least for my skin. \n",

    "body": "Last summer, I was able to purchase a bottle of [Cotz Prime and Protect Suncreen](https://cotzskincare.com/products/cotz-face-prime-protect-tinted-spf-40) while in the states and like many others, I fell in love with this mineral sunscreen for my sensitive acne prone skin. Since it is quite unavailable in Canada, I began searching for a dupe. Luckily, I stumbled across [Tizo3 Primer/Sunscreen](https://tizoskin.com/collections/protection/products/tizo3-facial-primer) and in my opinion, it is a 98% dupe for the Cotz Prime and Protect.\n\n**Ingredients of both (near identical list and order):**\n\n* **COTZ:** **Titanium Dioxide 8%, Zinc Oxide 3.8%** \\- *Inactive Ingredients:* Alumina, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Iron Oxide (CI77491), Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18-Hydrogen Dimethicone, Hydrogen Dimethicone, PEG-10 Dimethicone\n* **Tizo: Titanium Dioxide 8%, Zinc Oxide 3.8%**  \\- *Inactive Ingredients:* Alumina, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Iron Oxide (CI77491), Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18 Methicone, Hydrogen Dimethicone, PEG-10 Dimethicone, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n* As well, here is a patch test of both products side by side. Cotz is on the left, Tizo is on the right. [https://imgur.com/a/EKRBH9q](https://imgur.com/a/EKRBH9q)\n\n**Differences I noticed (and why I prefer the Tizo Sunscreen):**\n\n* The formulation feels near identical, however Cotz is a tiny bit more moussey and creamier. This makes it easier to work in, but **Cotz does take a couple minutes to dry down.**\n* **The Cotz sunscreen has a tiny tone up effect.** You cant really tell in my patch pictures, but when I put it on my face I do have a ever so slight white case. Not a true cast, but just a pinkening/whitening up effect.\n* The Tizo does not have a tone up effect, in fact **Tizo evens out my skin tone really well.** While both sunscreens are \"tinted\", the brown color dissipates and it blends out to a very sheer coverage. It definitely evens out my entire tone. While cotz did this too, Tizo does this without making me look white.\n* **Cotz ended up drying out my skin a little it** by the end of the day. Not too heavily, but I would get a little bit dry in the areas where im prone to dryness. I did not experience this with Tizo.\n\nHope this is helpful for someone! Note that I bought Tizo from [https://beautysense.ca/](https://beautysense.ca/)",

    "body": "I made a post yesterday asking if anyone has experience with this line of products that no one answered. I assume this is because no one has used any of them, which is understandable. The ingredients are a bit hard to track down and it's a Wal-Mart brand. Not exactly the pinnacle of skincare. But I'm a slut for a \"natural\" product and I like the packaging. There have been mostly positive reviews everywhere I looked. Usually I'd wait a couple days to make a review post but I had to post something today because honestly? I'm kind of shook. I'm going to include the [skincarisma.com](https://skincarisma.com) link for a look at the specific products I used, but the ingredients are on Wal-Mart's website. This is going to be long, since I'm giving info on the whole line and tested out 4 products.\n\nSo here's the scoop:\n\nEarth to Skin is a brand-spankin' new skincare line that Wal-Mart came out with in September. I think they're all under $10, except for the starter kits that are roughly $10. The individual pieces go as low as $7. It's based entirely around natural ingredients and it has four lines that come with moisturizers, sheet masks, cleaners, serums, toners, eye creams, and some miscellaneous products. The lines are:\n\n\\- Tea Time, which uses ingredients such as chamomile tea, black tea, white tea and kombucha\n\n\\-Super Fruits, which uses ingredients such as blueberries, bananas, watermelon, etc\n\n\\-Honey Manuka, which is almost entirely Manuka Honey with some royal jelly here and there\n\n\\-Super Greens, which uses ingredients like cucumbers and avocados\n\nI wanted the honey Manuka all-over serum, but couldn't find it. I also couldn't find a full jar of the honey Manuka day cream so I got the starter kit (they have one for all 4 lines) that includes two cute little pots of the night and day cream, the cleanser, and the royal jelly eye cream.

I start, I'll go ahead and say that a lot of these products have silicones, and almost all of them have fragrances. A lot of them also have fungal acne triggers, so just beware. Definitely use the cosmetic analyzer on skincarisma to check out what's in them if you have sensitive skin.\n\nTo start, I used the toner in place of my Rose Petal Witch Hazel toner last night and this morning, and I feel like it cleaned up the left-over gross stuff well. The cotton pad came away darker than usual, but my face didn't feel stripped. The scent wasn't strong, although the formula does include fragrances. Only con for me is that the bottle is very stiff plastic and very hard to squeeze. Overall, I liked it better than the witch hazel. I couldn't really ask for more from it and will continue with it.\n\nThe night cream is a stiff dark yellow cream. It had a burst of initial scent that smelled like natural honey, not artificial honey, but that went away quickly. I did a lazy patch test of the night cream during my nightly routine. I did the night cream on one cheek and my usually night time moisturizer on the rest of my face. Then followed up with AZA. I was pleasantly surprised when I woke up this morning. I've been getting little conedomes popping up on my cheeks, and I'm pretty sure my night time moisturizer has been the culprit, because the cheek that had the night cream on it was almost entirely clear. The other cheek had the usual spots. It also moisturized as well as I expected. I'm impressed and I'm going to continue using it.\n\nThe eye cream is a stiff, white and scentless cream. I really don't have anything else to say about it honestly. It was there, but so were my bags and hyper-pigmentation. Didn't hurt or help anything. I'll use it up because maybe it'll do something after a week or so but right now it's just meh.\n\nHere's where I think I have a holy grail product: the day cream. It's light yellow and a solid combo of gel and cream. Very light, and the scent was roughly the same as the night cream. I did a lazy patch test hours before I did my routine for the night, and my skin \\*drank\\* this stuff up. It had been irritated all day because the night before was my first day using Stridex and my daily moisturizer wasn't cutting it. My cheek instantly loosened up. I could feel the skin relax after being tight all day. This morning, I used it on top of my CosRX Snail 92 all-in-one cream. The snail cream is usually tacky for a while and leaves my face shiny. The day cream on top of it had that shine matted down in minutes, and within the hour, the tackiness was greatly reduced. Two hours later and my skin has just been left soft.\n\nMy favorite part of it by far is the redness reducing and blemish healing. Skincarisma says that the honey Manuka products promote wound healing, and from what I've read about honey, that's generally a true statement. Honey is good for wounds of all types, especially because its anti-bacterial. I use honey on canker sores that can last for days, and it'll have them healed up in hours. I had used those stainless steel pimple popping tools on the little cones I was left with this morning so I had some red spots, plus some existing pimples. My face is also generally pink/red. When I put on the cream, those bigger pimples burned just a bit and continued to sting almost imperceptibly for a few minutes. It felt the same as when I put honey on a canker sore to heal it up. When I walked out the door 15 minutes later to go to class, the general redness was greatly reduced and the redness from the blemishes was quickly fading. It was really cool. As it stands now, my face is red because it's hot in the room I'm in, but you can't even see the spots, and to be clear, I didn't use any other \"acne-fighting\" products, like salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide, besides the stridex from Tuesday evening. Like with the others, I'm super impressed and will continue using this.\n\n\\*\\*Conclusion\\*\\*\n\nI know I'm jumping the gun on this stuff by posting not even 24 hours after using them, but I was honestly so excited to share. I'll probably keep updating this post until next Wednesday, to give it time to settle and start really working. But overall, I'm really excited about this line. I'm shocked that Wal-Mart would put out something so good. However, if you have sensitive skin, do beware. Check out the cosmetics analyzer. As stated above, there's a lot of fungal acne triggers in a lot of them, fragrances, and silicones. They're not good for everyone. But if you've got some areas you'd like to address and your issues aren't too severe, check out this line. You might be surprised.",

The price point and size let me use it on my lower arms for a bit of sun damage from my youth.  I'm enjoying the Green Tea toner, too (also for niacinamide).  I wish they would list % for actives, but so far, so good.  I use other products from the Urban Skin Rx line for pigmentation issues, so not sure how much the Earth to Skin is doing in regard for pigmentation, but my skin seems to like it, not just tolerate it.

I ended up using youth to the people’s kale cleanser instead even though it was so much more expensive. I just wanted something with a similar formula and consistency. Since then I’ve been using benzoyl peroxide as my facial cleanser and it works just fine as well. I noticed that they have made an earth to skin website and it is it’s own little company now (under Walmart ofc). I’m considering going back and using it.",

I would love to use it morning *and* evening, but I'm concerned that it may be too occlusive to use under my chemical sunscreen (Biore Watery Essence).

They said occlusivity measures how well an ingredient keeps water from evaporating out of the skin (usually by being hydrophobic) but isn't really correlated with how well it prevents actives from penetrating into the skin as long as what you want to absorb is oil soluble. Alcohol is, and my sunscreen has a bunch of that, so I think I'm good!**",

I did a little research online, and checked prices online (for stores I have in my reigon) and notices that their price range was around 50$ each.. which, I cant really afford.\n\nBut today, while my younger sister was getting herself some self care goodies, I noticed that this very well known store has a product that contains Vitamin E, Vitamin C & Vitamin A for the price of 36$. Sounds almost too good to be true! Which, maybe it is, so I have few questions:\n\n1. Can those 3 vitamins be mixed together and still be effective?\n\n\n2. I've did a little research online after finding this product, and saw an article that said that while buying facial serums you would want them in a tinted/ colored bottle so the product wont be damaged from the sun(?).. the product I found is in a clear bottlw; how bad will it be?\n\n\n3. Along the articles, I read that it is best to apply the serum to your face after toner and before mosturizer.. is the toner part necessary..?\n\n\n4. I've read those vitamins can be causing allergic reactions (if you are unaware you are allergic to them when externally used; while internal doesnt give any alergic reaction) & to not use them if you have oily/ dehydrated skin.. how true is that?\n\n\n5. I have a list of the ingredients, does any one of those looks like a bad one to have in it? :\n\n\nCyclomethicone & Dimethiconol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Isononyl Isononanoate, Squalane, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate, Triclosan, Retinyl Palmitate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool, Benzyl Benzoate, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene.\n\n\n6. I've also read that keeping the serum in the fridge will make it last longer. Anyone does this & has it made your product last longer?\n\n\nI know it is a long of questions; but I want to make sure I'm paying for something that will give me the results I want.\n\nThank you so much in advance",

    "body": "Last summer, I was able to purchase a bottle of [Cotz Prime and Protect Suncreen](https://cotzskincare.com/products/cotz-face-prime-protect-tinted-spf-40) from the states and like many others, I fell in love with this mineral sunscreen for my sensitive acne prone skin. Since it is quite unavailable in Canada, I began searching for a dupe. Luckily, I stumbled across [Tizo3 Primer/Sunscreen](https://tizoskin.com/collections/protection/products/tizo3-facial-primer) and in my opinion, it is a 98% dupe for the Cotz Prime and Protect.\n\n**Ingredients of both (near identical list and order):**\n\n* **COTZ:** **Titanium Dioxide 8%, Zinc Oxide 3.8%** \\- *Inactive Ingredients:* Alumina, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Iron Oxide (CI77491), Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18-Hydrogen Dimethicone, Hydrogen Dimethicone, PEG-10 Dimethicone\n* **Tizo: Titanium Dioxide 8%, Zinc Oxide 3.8%**  \\- *Inactive Ingredients:* Alumina, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Iron Oxide (CI77491), Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18 Methicone, Hydrogen Dimethicone, PEG-10 Dimethicone, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n* As well, here is a patch test of both products side by side. Cotz is on the left, Tizo is on the right. [https://imgur.com/a/EKRBH9q](https://imgur.com/a/EKRBH9q)\n\n**Differences I noticed (and why I prefer the Tizo Sunscreen):**\n\n* The formulation feels near identical, however Cotz is a tiny bit more moussey and creamier. This makes it easier to work in, but **Cotz does take a couple minutes to dry down.**\n* **The Cotz sunscreen has a tiny tone up effect.** You cant really tell in my patch pictures, but when I put it on my face I do have a ever so slight white case. Not a true cast, but just a pinkening/whitening up effect.\n* The Tizo does not have a tone up effect, in fact **Tizo evens out my skin tone really well.** While both sunscreens are \"tinted\", the brown color dissipates and it blends out to a very sheer coverage. It definitely evens out my entire tone. While cotz did this too, Tizo does this without making me look white.\n* **Cotz ended up drying out my skin a little it** by the end of the day. Not too heavily, but I would get a little bit dry in the areas where im prone to dryness. I did not experience this with Tizo.\n\nHope this is helpful for someone! I also bought Tizo from [https://beautysense.ca/](https://beautysense.ca/)",

I followed directions and put it on like a moisturizer but IT BURNS. I’m guessing it’s because of my moisture barrier, but the description for the gel is specifically to heal irritation and damaged moisture barrier. Anyone else experience this? Did it go away eventually? I’ve tried layering over other moisturizer as well, but it doesn’t seem to make a noticeable difference that way.

At this point I will add that it's $265 a jar.

It makes my face feel smooth, hydrated, bright and literally wonderful and I hate how much I love it.\n\nYou guys KNOW that I am easily sucked in by products, so I was wondering if there are any ingredients that stick out, or if it's AT ALL possible to create something similar for less than $265.  Or even if there are any other similar products that will act the same.\n\nHere are the ingredients: \n\n* Water (Aqua/Eau), C12-20 Acid Peg-8 Ester, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Niacinamide, Glycerin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Phenoxyethanol, Saccharide Isomerate, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Carbomer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Panthenol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Parfum (Fragrance), Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethiconol, Disodium Edta, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Calophyllum Inophyllum Seed Oil, Aleurites Moluccana Seed Oil, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Carrageenan, Buteth-3, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate, Sodium Benzotriazolyl Butylphenol Sulfonate, Retinyl Palmitate, Peg-8, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Tocopherol, Rubus Idaeus Leaf Cell Culture, Tributyl Citrate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Nicotiana Sylvestris Leaf Cell Culture, Geraniol, Limonene, Linalool, Ascorbic Acid, Ci 19140 (Yellow 5)\n\nThanks in advance!!",

Info is [here](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/700910/C12-20_ACID_PEG-8_ESTER/).  Basically, I think this is where a lot of your magic happens.  It's a very low-molecular-weight ester of [polyethylene glycol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_glycol).  I'm purely hypothesizing here, but it seems like it would help with water retention and plumping.  PEG has been shown (according to the wikipedia article) to help with regeneration of nerve cells in damaged spines, so... maybe it's worth examining more.\n\nEDIT: /u/ph33rsockmonkey pointed out below that it's often used as a bulk/carrier agent, and not considered an \"active\" ingredient.\n\n3) Caprylic/Capric triglyceride: Found in coconut oil as well.  Here's info about [caprylic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caprylic_acid) - the triglyceride can be broken down into the acid on the skin, and it's a bit antibacterial.\n\n4) Butylene glycol: Info is [here](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/700861/BUTYLENE_GLYCOL/).  Basically a humectant.\n\n5) Coco-caprylate: More coconut-derived stuff, also probably a bit antibiotic (it's related to that caprylic acid/triglyceride), info [here](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/701534/COCO-CAPRYLATE/_CAPRATE/).  It's also listed as an emollient.\n\n6) Cetyl alcohol: Also coconut or other vegetable derived - it's everywhere. Emollient.

The stinging lasts about ten minutes if I don't wash the lotion off and stops immediately if I do wash it off (which I usually do).  Sometimes it doesn't sting at all, though.\n\nOther products that sometimes sting are the Neutrogena Hydro Gel stuff, which stings like death, and Indeed Hydroluron Gel, which stings slightly.  Indeed Hydroluron serum doesn't sting, the Hydroluron masks don't sting, and the Hada Labo hyaluronic acid serum doesn't sting.

    "body": "Hey guys! \n\nHere's a recent post I wrote on Silicones.  Thought it might be a good read, especially for people just starting out on a NoPoo routine.\n\nSilicones are a very common item found in shampoos and conditioners.  Do you know what they are or what they do to your hair?  We took some time to help clarify things for you.\n\n**What is Silicone?**\n\nSilicones are polymers comprised of synthetic materials used as plastics or resins.  They are found in everyday life in many many places such as bathtub caulk, silicone breast implants, automotive components, cookware, electronics, lubricants, personal care items etc. \n\nCommon names for silicones are Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Methicone, Amodimethicone, Dimethiconol, Cyclomethicone/Cyclopentasiloxane.  Well known water soluble silicones you can find are Cyclomethicone & Dimethicone Copolyol.\n\n**Why are Silicones added to hair products?**\n\nSilicones are added to hair products for a number of reasons.  Primarily:\n\n* Generally recognized as safe/non-toxic, low instances of negative reaction\n* Can make dry hair appear and feel healthy\n* Can make brushing easier\n* Reduces frizz\n* Can make split ends less visible\n* Heat resistant/protectant\n\n**What do Silicones do to your hair?**\n\nSilicones work on hair by coating each shaft/strand of hair in a layer of silicone which basically seals the hair strand off from the elements (water, air, oils, contaminants).  During initial use, the hair will appear to be shiny & healthy, but the key word here is APPEAR.  While your hair appears to be healthy, is it?  We don't necessarily think so.\n\nOver time, silicones (especially non-water soluble silicones) can build up on your hair causing it to weigh down, become limp, dull and lifeless.  Part of the reason for this is because the silicone buildup becomes damaged over time which shows in the appearance of your hair.  Think about it like waxing a floor EVERY DAY.\n\nAnother potential issue with silicones is that when your hair is completely coated and sealed, it cannot receive adequate hydration or any nourishing natural oils, ultimately affecting the overall health of your hair and look of your style.  This is especially damaging in \"Curly Gurls\" or tight textured ethnic hair which is naturally difficult to hydrate.\n\nAdditionally, silicone can eventually become sticky which will attract environmental contaminants (dirt, dust, etc) which further dulls your hair and is overall undesirable.\n\nWhen these things happen, people generally are inclined to wash more frequently, more vigorously and use more styling products all of which simply compound the issue in a viscous cycle.\n\n**Why we don't use Silicones:**\n\nThere are some very valid and good uses for silicone in hair care products.  For instance, if your hair is extremely dry/dull and you have a photo shoot, a water soluble silicone could get you through the day.  Likewise, if you were straightening your hair for an occasion, a water soluble silicone could provide good heat protection to your hair.\n\nHowever, at [ManeLine](http://manelinehaircare.com), we are of the opinion that silicones simply provide a short term solution/look, while fostering long term damage & frustration.\n\nWe believe that your hair can actually BE healthy vs just appearing healthy through limited ingredient, sulfate and silicone free hair care routines.  The natural oils from your scalp can provide the shine you desire without introducing potential long-term problems to your hair, look and style.\n\n",

Group 4 is bad news in my eyes.\n\nActually I avoid all of the silicone myself, but in case I get into a situation I'll have to use it, group 1 is fine and group 2 is possibly no problem either depending on the product you use to wash it out again.\n\nI hope you don't mind me adding to it, Jeffery c:",

If you like the way it makes your hair look and feel (and it's not outrageously expensive, because it shouldn't be) that's really what counts.\n\nIt's not necessarily bad (obligatory some people don't like sulfates cleansers, some people avoid heavy silicones) but there's also nothing special or unique about it.  \n\n**Edit**: I just noticed that it has zinc pyrithione in it, which can be a dandruff treatment.  I will check how much z.p. needs to be in a formula to be considered an active (edit: it's 0.3% for the control of dandruff (FDA final monograph [here](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Over-the-CounterOTCDrugs/StatusofOTCRulemakings/ucm111019.pdf), page 6 of the document).  That's plausible.  Not all the clear products seem to follow the labeling laws for OTCs though, and not all of the them even make dandruff-related claims, which might mean they're not all functional dandruff shampoos?  \n\n**OP, could you please give more information as to which shampoo in the Clear Line this is?  Is it being marketed as a Dandruff shampoo? Can you link to it?  I cant quickly find the one that matches the name in your title and the ingredient list in your post.**\n\n**Edit**: Just because it's interesting, Clear is owned by Unilever.  I thought it might be interesting to look at some of Unilever's other brand's products.\n\nHere's Suave Deep Moisture shampoo:\n\n> Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Glycerin, Dimethiconol, Fragrance, Carbomer, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, TEA Dodecylbenzenesulfonate, PPG 9, Tetrasodium EDTA, TEA Sulfate, DMDM Hydantoin, Citric Acid, PEG 45M, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panthenol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)\n\nYou can see it's pretty similar.  This one doesn't have the dimethicone, but the basic system is very close.\n\nHere's Dove Nutritive Solutions Daily Moisture:\n\n> Water (Aqua), Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Glycol Distearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Fragrance (Parfum), Glycerin, Dimethicone, Dimethiconol, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Tetrasodium EDTA, Amodimethicone, DMDM Hydantoin, PEG-45M, Tea-Dodecylbenzenesulfonate, Cocamide Mea, Lysine HCI, Arginine, Peg-9M, Cetrimonium Chloride, PPG-9, Propylene Glycol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Red 33 (CI 17200).\n\nAgain, not identical of course, but pretty similar.  The basic sulfate cleanser + silicone is pretty common in \"moisturizing\" shampoos.\n\nIf your product is a real dandruff shampoo, here's a rival: Head and Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Shampoo:\n\n> active ingredient: zinc pyrithione 1% inactive ingredients: Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Dimethicone, Cocamide MEA, Zinc Carbonate, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Fragrance, Cetyl Alcohol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Magnesium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Magnesium Carbonate Hydroxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Yellow 5, Red 33, Blue 1\n\nNot identical again (could plausibly expect it to be a stronger cleanser), but same sort of idea.

That could *potentially* cause some problems on the scalp, but there are two caveats to what I'm saying: 1) GHC is pretty low on the ingredients list here, so it might not be enough to interact with the dimethicone to any significant degree 2) I've only read research on this in the context of binding to hair, not skin. I can't say whether or not the action would happen there too.\n\nSo if this is making you happy, then you're probably good to go. Just keep an objective eye on it for a month or two perhaps to see if there's any serious uptick in hair loss or dandruff. Like Hamfan said as well, it likely won't be very gentle to the scalp because of the sodium laureth sulfate, so if your skin is on the sensitive side, that might cause you some dryness and hair fall. \n\nKey word in all this being *might.*",

My hands will actually curl up in my sleep because my skin is so dry it's uncomfortable to open my hand fully. I've always had trouble finding a hand lotion that will provide lasting relief. The hand lotions feel good for about five minutes, and then my skin feels raw and dry again, almost worse than before I applied the lotion. \n\n\nThe only hand lotion I've ever found to work is Gold Bond. But I'm curious about why it might be happening and what the lotion ingredients are doing. \n\nAnyone have any ideas? Or product recommendations if you've experienced a similar problem?\n\nI included a list of the ingredients for the lotions I've gone through recently trying to find something that works.\n__________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n**Lotion comparison:**  Listed in order of efficacy. Gold Bond works the best, but not perfect. Burt's Bees I will put on and then wear cotton gloves to sleep. It works as a treatment, but is too overwhelming and waxy for regular use. Vaseline lotions come in third. Everything else isn't even really competing. Lubriderm and Jergens are minimally effective.

    "body": "I’m From Mugwort Cream\n\nThe mugwort line from I’m From features some of my favorite soothing/calming products. Artemisia/mugwort is known for its ability to bring down redness and inflammation...and I’m From’s offerings contain some of the higher percentages of the ingredient that I have seen.\n\nTheir Mugwort Cream contains 73.55% mugwort extract alongside shea butter, father david elm extract, and fermented soybean/cogon grass extracts. The entire formulation reads like an herbal remedy that I imagine being concocted at an apothecary.\n\nAs for the consistency/texture...I was quite surprised. The cream has a lightweight look and nearly gel-like feel when first applied. But, once it’s gotten a chance to absorb there is a bit more of an occlusive feel and even slight residue left behind (which might not be ideal for those with oily skin that prefer really watery hydrators).\n\nHowever, it ended up being the lack of immediate calming/soothing that made this product a bit less impressive than the rest of the I’m From Mugwort products.\n\nWhile I did see an improvement to redness and irritation over the course of the past month...there wasn’t that immediate hit of redness reduction that I appreciated in the other products. I could always turn to the I’m From Mugwort Essence to bring my skin back from the brink when adjusting to Tretinoin or after being in the sun too long. \n\nThe I’m From Mugwort Cream just doesn’t seem to have that “triage” ability that I was hoping to see. The amount of hydration and moisture-locking ability is really nice though. Dry/normal skin that experiences redness or sensitivity might get along well with this product...but there might be a slower build to visible calming results. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Artemisia Princeps Extract, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Glycerin, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Stearic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Arachidyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Flower Extract, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, C14-28 Alkyl Acid, Stearyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-2 Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Allatoin, Boswellia Serrata Resin Extract, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/ VP Copolymer, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/ Sodium Acryloydimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Dimethiconol, Saccharamyces/ Viscum Album (Misletoe) Ferment Extract, Lactobacillus/ Soybean Ferment Extract, Saccharomyces/ Viscum Album (Misletoe) Ferment Extract, Lactobacillus/ Soybean Ferment Extract, Saccharomyces/ Imperata Cylindrica Root Ferment Extract, Disodium EDTA, Polyglutamic Acid, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Artemisia Vulgaris Oil\n\nWhere To Buy ($32.00 USD - Wishtrend - 50ml): [https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/mugwort-cream/](https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/mugwort-cream/) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1v2hb1nphrq51.jpg?width=4707&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6c1d9c6fc79b1872a8b62a5f86e994978fc3754f",

    "body": "I went to Costco today, and there are a bunch of two packs of this \"Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream Ultimate\" there. The ingredients are almost identical to the old formula! I know the new formula with Niacinamide has not been getting great reviews, but I haven't seen this cream before. Here's a link: [https://www.costco.com/cetaphil-moisturizing-cream-ultimate-with-prebiotic-aloe%2C-very-dry-to-dry-sensitive-skin%2C-20-oz-%2B-16-oz%2C-2-pack.product.4000058742.html](https://www.costco.com/cetaphil-moisturizing-cream-ultimate-with-prebiotic-aloe%2C-very-dry-to-dry-sensitive-skin%2C-20-oz-%2B-16-oz%2C-2-pack.product.4000058742.html)\n\nIt says that it has prebiotic aloe, but the ingredients show that it's essentially at the bottom of the list, meaning it probably doesn't matter much. The only difference between this formula and the old formula are the last few ingredients, which shouldn't matter much, right? I just love the old formula and am so scared to try to new one with niacinamide because I'm pretty sure niacinamide breaks me out.\n\nThe weird thing is, the sign at Costco said this product is new and it has the updated Cetaphil logo. However, I can't find anything about it online except on the Costco website. I don't even see this product on the Cetaphil website. I have never heard of there being an \"Ultimate\" cream. It just seems weird, but also if the ingredients are really almost identical and there is no niacinamide in this formulation, then is this a win for us? Will this continue to be sold at Costco? Has anyone tried this or heard about this? Thoughts?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor reference, here are the two ingredients lists for each cream with the differences highlighted:\n\nCetaphil Moisturizing Cream Old Formulation Ingredients...\n\nWater, Glycerin, Petrolatum, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Peg-30 Stearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Dimethiconol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Propylene Glycol, ***Disodium EDTA, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide***\n\nCetaphil Moisturizing Cream Ultimate with Prebiotic Aloe Ingredients...\n\nWater, Glycerin, Petrolatum, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Peg-30 Stearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Dimethiconol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Propylene Glycol, ***Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice Powder, Tocopherol, BHT***",

It's rated a 5 on the EWG website for being a potential carcinogen. For context, the European Union prohibits the use of BHA as fragrance ingredient in cosmetics. The State of California requires warning labels on products containing BHA, notifying consumers that this ingredient may cause cancer. Interestingly, I bought mine at a Costco in CA and I do not see a warning label. I'll inquire with Cetaphil about this and follow up here...",

I don’t even have to follow up with an oil! I use niacinamide  in my hydrating or serum steps so I don’t need it in my moisturizer. If you want niacinamide in the moisturizer I would check out the Bioderma atoderm crème some folks love it. They also have a baume but it has no niacinamide. My reason for loving the la roche posay was the soothing nature of the thermal water and the occlusion so the avene ticks the boxes for even tho it’s pricey - well worth it with a coupon or discount on sale. Also if occlusion is very important to you I know the Uriage xemose cream and xemose oil balm are also great! I just can’t find them easily where I’m located. If you’re super dry I’d go for a baume if your combo to dry the crème could do the trick. Good luck on your search :)",

I came across a sponsored post on Dr. Dray's youtube channel in which she talked about the product PROcure Rosacare Hydrogel. I was skeptical because sponsored posts are normally not the greatest, but i went out and bought the product from CVS anyway (if your going to buy this at a drugstore, its sold in the first aid section).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHoly smokes, this is bar none the **BEST moisturizer i have ever used**. I had tiny, skin colored bumps all over my face, including a few breakouts and within 4 days my skin was completly clear! All the bumps were GONE! My face is also extremely hydrated and moisturized. This isn't a long term review but i was so excited that i had to share.

Other concerns include enlarged pores, rosacea in the nose area, closed comedones, and a selection of pimples.\n\nI have come to the conclusion that my face must be as dehydrated as Gobi desert out of rain season, and so my first action was to moisturise, moisturise, moisturise! At the same time, I wanted to include products meant for sensitive skin, to decrease the risk of a breakout or adverse reaction. I also tend to avoid perfumed skincare, and that was another factor when I was picking the jars and bottles.\n\nAny critique of my routine would be most welcome! Do these products work together? Is there something crucial missing? \\(I am planning on incorporating exfoliation and sunscreen next. Also, please, don't panic — I have not seen the sun in months. Years. Or so it feels.\\) Is there something I should stop using? Am I truly a happy victim of clever marketing and a corporate\\-friendly whore? \\(You betcha.\\)\n\nSo far, the result has been a more even \\(texture, not colour\\) skin with smaller pores, but, of course, this is early days.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# QUESTION\n\nA crucial point of my morning routine, and not something normally suggested for beginners, is a mask. I apply it just before I sit down to meditate. It makes sense that, while I imagine 'a steady stream of liquid sunlight' pouring through my body, I am also using that time to take care of my skin. I have found that one action triggers the other and, altogether, that is a very happy combination.\n\nI have been using the Lumene Hydration Recovery mask for the past few days, and I want to hear your suggestions for alternatives. While I did not dislike that mask, I did not feel like it was doing much for me either. Plus, it was a gift from Finland and I am in Britain, and that does not work very easily. Lastly, I would like to try a number of masks \\(and continue to discover new awesome products\\), rather than settle on a single 'meh' option.\n\nCan you help me find the mask\\(s\\)? To sum it up, I'm looking for a mask that...\n\n* Has a 10\\-15 minute application period\n* Comes in a tube or a jar \\(i.e. not a sheet mask\\)\n* Is suitable for frequent use\n* Fits my routine \\(see above\\)\n\nSuggestions of mask combinations \\(alternating masks\\) are also welcome!",

        "body": "Maskholic here, checking in. \n\nI usually do a mask everyday, it’s my favorite part of my routine. My love for masks makes me always be on the lookout for a new one and I’ve tried many out there. \n\nI’m not really a fan of sheet masks, or I haven’t tried any that has impressed me so I won’t mention those. They feel nice and are relaxing, but that’s about it. \n\nI really love Freeman’s Apple Cider Vinegar Clay mask. You can use it as a cleanser scrub or use it as a mask, I’ve only used it as a mask. I think it can be used about 2-3 times per week, so it can be used to alternate with other masks. What I like: it’s inexpensive, makes my skin feel extra soft and clean, my skin tone looks brighter even after just one use. \n\nI got this face mask kit from [Fresh at Sephora] (https://m.sephora.com/product/picture-perfect-mask-set-P424612?SKUID=1998459&om_mmc=ppc-GG_1165716881_53825939660_pla-420369839425_1998459_257731947998_9007386_m&country_switch=us&lang=en&gclid=CKnR1YzD3toCFYPIswodzf8JcQ&gclsrc=ds) and I absolutely love every mask that comes in it. \n\nThe Umbrian Clay Mask I find really improves the appearance of pores, blackheads/white heads. It feels good and relaxing to have it on. It says to use for up to 5 minutes, but I always start doing stuff and end up using it for longer. I find this mask is nice to use as a “premask” for the Rose or Black Tea mask. I only do this about once a week, when I’m feeling fancy. \n\nThe Rose mask feels like heaven on your skin. It has this nice cooling feeling and I find it to be very hydrating, and it makes my skin look supple and radiant. \n\nThe Black Tea mask says to use 2-3 times per week. It tingles very intensely for the first minute, but after that it feels fine.  I find this mask seems to even the texture of my skin somewhat (I’ve only used it once so far). \n\nI’ve also tried FAB Ginger Turmeric Jelly Mask. I like this one better as I love the cooling jelly on my skin. I find that it gives my skin a nice radiant glow. You can use it up to 3 times per week. I tried FAB’s bouncy mask too (a sample) and I wouldn’t buy it because I didn’t see any difference and it didn’t feel as good as the other masks I love. \n\nClinique Pep Start Bubble Mask. This is a fun mask to use in the morning as you don’t have to leave it on for long. I like the bubbling effect, it makes my skin feel extra clean and revitalized. I’ve only used this 2 times in some samples I got. \n\nBoscia Luminizing black masks. I really love this one as I find it to be very clarifying, and helps with the appearance of pores. I love peeling it off, it’s so fun and i feel like it takes so much with it. \n\nI have a few others in my cabinet that I haven’t tried yet, but I’ll report back when I do.",

I look at the active ingredients Titanium Dioxide 8%, Zinc Oxide 3.8% and I don't understand how it can amount to a PA ++++ sunscreen. Titanium dioxide doesn't even fully cover all of UVA1 and UVA 2 rays fully. Zinc Oxide does cover UVA1 and 2 but there's only 3.8% in this sunscreen.\n\n*Here's a list of the active and inactive ingredients:*\n\n**Active Ingredients:** Titanium Dioxide 8%, Zinc Oxide 3.8%\n\n**Ingredients:** Alumina, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18-Hydrogen Dimethicone, Hydrogen Dimethicone, PEG-10 Dimethicone\n\nI was researching for a sunscreen with low comedogenic and few ingredients as most sunscreens break me out. [Here's a link to the comedogenic rating of the ingredients on CosDNA](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_d80e525355.html) of the sunscreen.\n\n**Is there an inactive ingredient here that somehow helps the UVA protection that I'm not seeing?**",

        "body": "Contrary to what many believe (I am looking at you Dr Dray) Titanium Dioxide blocks a good amount of UVA and it definitely adds to the PA value.\n\nIn addition, PA++++ is not a very high UVA protection that is impossible to achieve with a mineral sunscreen. It will of course come with a white cast, but it can be achieved.\n\nLooking at the percentages, especially for mineral filters, does not say much as they particle size varies, and the respective protection factors change dramatically. \n\nThe protection is also affected by how well the minerals are dispersed in the formula and that is the reason why you cannot make your own sunscreen just by putting a certain percentage of mineral filters in a cream. Poorly dispersed mineral filters will give extremely low protection and vice versa.\n\nComedogenicity charts should not be taken very seriously. They have been created by methods that are not very accurate (i.e. not on human skin, etc.) and they refer to 100% of the ingredient which is completely different compared to using a small percentage of it. An ingredient after the first 4 to 5 ingredients will usually be at a concentration lower than 5% so as you can imagine a “comedogenic” ingredient, used at 2% or 1% in a formula will not have the same effect.",

I always thought soft silky elastic hair = moisturized which is why I am writing this post because it no longer feels soft and silky, it feels rough.\n\nHeres the Shampoo https://www.makeupalley.com/product/showreview.asp/ItemId=133656/Kirkland-Moisture-Shampoo/Unlisted-Brand/Hair\n\nIngredients: water sodium cocoyl isethionate cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine methyl isethionate disodium cocoyl glutamate sodium lauryl sulfoacetate decyl glecoside ammonium cocoyl isethionate divinyldimethicond/dimethicone copolymer disodium laureth sulfosuccinate helianthus annus (sunflower) seed oil lycium barbarum fruit extract aloe barbadensis leaf extract camellia sinesis leaf extract cucumis sativus (cucumber) fruit extract persea gratissima (avocado) fruit extract punica granatum extract melanin vitis vinifera (grape) seed extract glycol disterate glycerin fragrance quaternium-91 sodium cocoyl glutamate peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate amodimethicone panthenol polyquaternium-10 ppg-3 benzyl ether myristate chlorphenesin methyl gluceth-20 guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride c11-15 pareth-7 laureth-9 phospholipids hydrolyzed vegetable protein pg-propyl silanetriol c12-13 pareth-23 c12-13 pareth-3 trisodium ethylenediamine disuccinate trideceth-12 superoxide dismutase sodium ascorbyl phosphate tocopheryl acetate methylchloroisothiazolinone methylisothiazolinone\n\nAnd the Conditioner: http://www.makeupalley.com/product/showreview.asp/ItemId=133657/KIRKLAND-MOISTURE-CONDITIONER/Unlisted-Brand/Hair\n\nIngredients: water cyclopentasiloxane cetearyl alcohol stearyl alcohol cetrimonium chloride behentrimonium methosulfate helianthus annus (sunflower) seed oil lycium barbarum fruit extract aloe barbadensis leaf extract camellia sinesis leaf extract cucumis sativus (cucumber) fruit extract persea gratissima (avocado) fruit extract punica granatum extract melanin vitis vinifera (grape) seed extract helianthus annus (sunflower) seed extract glycereth-26 dimethiconol divinyldimethicone/dimethicone copolymer fragrance gluconolactone cetrimonium bromide panthenol ppg-3 benzyl ether myristate jojoba esters quaternium-91 amodimethicone hydroxyethylcelloulose cetrimonium methosulfate sodium benzoate c11-15 pareth-7 peg-45m laureth-9 aminomethly propanol glycerin butyrospermum parkii ( shea butter) c12-13 pareth-23 c12-13 pareth-3 cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride (sunscreens) trideceth-12 citric acid ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate sodium ascorbyl phosphate butylene glycol hydrolyed soy protein tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e) hydrolyzed vegatable protein pg-propyl silanetriol\n\nedit: Some more info, My hair is just above shoulder length, when i get in the shower i use a wide tooth comb to get rid of knots then i soak my hair with warm water then lather the shampoo all over scalp and from root to end then rinse then i take a huge blob of Conditioner and use it the same way and leave it in for 1-2 minutes then rinse with cold water.\n\nThanks for the help!",

Rinsing your hair will have the shampoo run down your strands to clean them. You can also consider combing once your hair is saturated with conditioner and not rinsing all of it out.",

I got some mixed answers as to whether it could be used on the face or not.\n\nI have been using it on my face for a couple of days and have yet to notice any major issues. Granted, it has only been a couple days so I reckon if there is any irritation, it would have been apparent by now. As to whether it clogs pores, I reckon it will take a bit more time to find out.\n\nAs such, has anyone used this product on their face before and if so, what was your experience like?\n\nBelow is the ingredient list for your easy reference:\n\nWater, glycerin, urea, cetearyl alcohol, glyceryl glucoside,  cyclomethicone, sodium lactate, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter,  caprylic/capric triglyceride, methylpropanediol, octyldodecanol,  dicaprylyl ether, tapioca starch, glyceryl stearate se, hydrogenated  coco-glycerides, arginine hcl, sodium pca, dimethiconol, lactic acid,  chondrus crispus (carrageenan), carnitine, ceramide np, mannitol,  serine, sucrose, citrulline, glycogen, histidine hcl, alanine,  threonine, glutamic acid, sodium cetearyl sulfate, 1,2-hexanediol,  phenoxyethanol.\n\nI have checked incidecoder and cosdna. The only *major* issue appears to be chondrus crispus (carrageenan) which is listed as a 5 on the comedogenic rating. However, cross-checking this with paula's choice, which often has articles on certain \"comedogenic\" ingredients, it is described as being safe and that it would not clog pores.\n\nAny thoughts?",

    "body": "# Hair Oils\n\nPeople have used oil in hair care regimens for thousands of years. One of the earliest recorded use cases was of the [ancient Egyptians](https://www.arabnews.com/secret-ancient-egyptian-beauty), who applied castor oil to their hair. It wasn't until 1950 that a scholar named Martin Levey suggested using the distillation process to extract oils from plants in [prehistoric Mesopotamia](https://exarc.net/issue-2020-2/ea/ancient-distillation-and-experimental-archaeology). He published his findings in a paper called the [Evidences of Ancient Distillation, Sublimation , and Extraction in Mesopotamia](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0498.1955.tb00466.x). With advances in technology, the distillation process looks different today, but it's generally the same and is how the majority of the oils you use every day are made. In this post, I help you understand the different types of oils and which ones you should be using on your hair.  (This is the full blog but if you want to screenshot the ingredient lists, the post is a bit better organized on my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-recommended-product-ingredients.html))\n\n**Types of Oils**  \n*Plant Oils*  \n[These oils](https://cosmeticsandtoiletries.texterity.com/cosmeticsandtoiletries/june_2021/MobilePagedReplica.action?pm=1&folio=24#pg35) are pressed, crushed, and refined from the fatty portions of a plant or botanical. They are less aromatic and have the ability to sink into your hair shaft, unlike mineral oils, which can make them a more effective moisturizing ingredient depending on your needs.   \n\n\n*Mineral Oils*  \nThese oils are made from petroleum that is [highly refined](https://www.chemicalsafetyfacts.org/mineral-oil/). They have a lower price point compared to plant oils and essential oils, which can influence which brands will include them in product formulas. They're known to create a barrier on the surface of your hair shaft to lock moisture in.  \n\n\n*Essential Oils*  \nThese oils are [distilled](https://www.thezoereport.com/p/oils-vs-essential-oils-the-biggest-differences-the-most-popular-uses-more-19442788) from leaves, roots, bark and other aromatic portions of plants. The distillation process turns the raw ingredients left over into a more concentrated, highly aromatic oil. They're used for their smell and are thought to have therapeutic benefits, but will irritate your skin if not heavily diluted with mineral or plant oils.   \n\n\n*Silicone (not an oil)*  \nWhile not technically an oil, silicone provides conditioning qualities that are similar. There are two types to be aware of: (1) soluble and (2) non-soluble. The main difference between them is that one can be broken down by water and the other cannot, meaning it requires harsher shampoos with surfactants to wash it away after continued use. You can tell the difference between them based on their ingredients, which I've listed below. You can also read more about silicones in my posts [*How Often Should I Shampoo?*](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html) and [*Ingredient Lists*](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-ingredient-lists.html). ​ ​​\n\n* Non-soluble: Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Amodimethicone, Pheryl trimethicone, Ceteraryl methicone, Dimethiconol, Stearyl dimethicone, Amodimethicone (non-soluble when Trideceth-12 and Cetrimonium Chloride are absent)\n* Soluble: Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone copolyol, Lauryl methicone copolyol, any silicone with PEG as a prefix\n\n**Oils for Hair with High Porosity vs. Low Porosity**   \n​Finding the right oil for your hair texture can be challenging, but if you can identify the porosity of your hair it will help guide the process. Genetics and they way you care for your hair are the biggest influencers of its porosity. Styling tools with high heat, coloring, perming and other hair care/services can cause your porosity to change. Although the signs of highly porous hair are not widely considered “healthy looking”, the benefit for some can be more volume and fullness.  \n\n\nHair with low porosity is considered to be “healthy”, but it comes with its own challenges. According to the [Science-y Hair Blog](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/oils-which-ones-soak-in-vs-coat-hair.html) “If you have fine or soft hair which is easily over-conditioned, those same oils may make your hair feel greasy and lank unless used in very small amounts. Lower porosity hair may do better with blends of penetrating oils and less-penetrating oils.” The chart below will help you determine your porosity and show you what oils have been found to \"[penetrate the cortex](https://cosmeticsandtoiletries.texterity.com/cosmeticsandtoiletries/july_august_2021/MobilePagedReplica.action?pm=1&folio=DM5#pg51)\", or the second layer of your hair shaft that sits behind your outer cuticle. Your porosity level is a good thing to keep in mind when searching for new hair products.**Signs of Hair with** **High Porosity****Signs of Hair with** **Low Porosity**Hair that is: \n\n* Dry, rough and /or dull\n* Full with volume\n* Coarser than usual (generally on the ends)\n* Tangling easily\n* Experiencing breakage\n* Air drying within 15 minutes\n* Soaking up oil-based products quickly \n\nFor oil treatments, use **penetrating oils** on your ends  and a **mix of less penetrating oils plus penetrating oils** from your roots to mid hair shaft.Hair that is:\n\n* Smooth and sleek\n* Flat and lacking volume\n* Heavier with a slick/greasy feel\n* Easily combed or brushed \n* Not experiencing breakage\n* Taking 30 minutes or more to air dry\n* Unable to soak up oil-based products easily\n\n​  \nFor oil treatments, mix  **penetrating** and  **less penetrating** oils.  \n​  \n​*Sources:* [*Enhancing Hair Health: Effects of Oiling, Inside and Out - Part I*](https://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/research/literature-data/article/21836362/cosmetics-and-toiletries-magazine-enhancing-hair-health-effects-of-oiling-inside-and-outpart-i)*, Cosmetics & Toiletries*  \n[*Enhancing Hair Health: Effects of Oiling, Inside and Out - Part II*](https://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/research/literature-data/article/21836386/cosmetics-and-toiletries-magazine-enhancing-hair-health-effects-of-oiling-inside-and-outpart-ii)*, Cosmetics & Toiletries*  \n[*Oils - Which Ones Soak in vs. Coat the Hair?*](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/oils-which-ones-soak-in-vs-coat-hair.html)*, Science-y Hair Blog*  \n[*Beginner's Guide to Ingredients in Natural Hair Products*](https://www.texturedtalk.com/how-to-understand-ingredients-in-natural-hair-products/) *, Textured Talk*  \n[*15 Scientific Names for Common Ingredients in Natural Hair Products*](http://www.1blessednatural.com/2015/10/15-scientific-names-for-common-ingredients-natural-hair-products.html)*, 1Blessed  Natural Mag***Penetrating OilsLess Penetrating OilsNot Recommended**​Coconut *(Cocos Nucifera)* Oil   \n​  \n​Sunflower *(Helianthus Annuus)* Seed Oil Olive *(Olea Europaea)* Oil  \n\n\nArgan *(Argania Spinosa)* OilMineral Oil   \n\n\nJojoba *(Simmondsia Chinensis)* Oil  \n**​Related blog posts:**  \n[Ingredient Lists](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-ingredient-lists.html)  \n[Hair Product Labels](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-product-labels.html)  \n[Applying Hair Products](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-applying-hair-products.html)",

I Shampoo/Condition my hair 2-3 times a week and dried with a T-shirt. Everything was going great until a week ago where I noticed my hair didn't feel the same anymore. I don't know how to describe it, but it almost feels rough and in need of conditioner? and my ends feel drier that normal. I am not sure whats happening my first thought was damage since I've been growing it out for almost a year without a trim or a cut. Now i'm starting to think that there is some sort of build up?

Only today that I became curious and sat down in front of the computer looking for user reviews. I was surprised that there was virtually none!\n\nThe product seems to be available only in [Thailand](https://www.larocheposay-th.com/product/hydraphase-empowering-thermal-water-essence) and [Hong Kong](http://www.en.laroche-posay.hk/products-treatments/Hydraphase/Hydraphase-Empowering-Thermal-Water-Essence-p19691.aspx). This feels like the product is questionable. The Thai website (not sure if official) even gives blatant misinformation that the product contains arginine, serine, and ascorbyl glucoside, which it doesn't! (Whoever prepared that page must've confused it with Hydraphase Intense Serum, which is not available in Thailand.) The Hong Kong website lists correct ingredients.\n\nApart from the usual moisturising agents (glycerin, dimethicone, dimethiconol, isononyl isononanoate, caprylyl glycol), it contains what's called Vitreoscilla ferment, which is featured on the product box under the marketese-sounding name Aqua Posae Filiformis. There doesn't seem to be much information about it on the Internet. From what I can gather so far, it's a bacterial extract made from [Vitreoscilla filiformis](http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=637093) and used in only 3 L'Oreal brands: La Roche-Posay, Biotherm, and Lancôme. There are peer-reviewed research articles about the bacteria here and there, many of which are affiliated to L'Oreal itself.\n\nI'm not familiar with cosmetic products in general. Should I be concerned about anything? As I mentioned at the beginning, I'm just trying the product out. I actually quite like it as a moisturising base for when I apply my sunscreen (Anthelios XL). Should I bother continuing with it once the current bottle is used up? Normally the only thing on my face is just my main moisturiser (Avène Hydrance Optimale Light).",

It dries down without leaving a greasy film and sits well under makeup. \n\n**Tint:** [here](https://i.imgur.com/sTpb8Rx.jpg) is a photo of the tint in natural light. It leans peachy but has blended in on my mom who has light skin with yellow undertones and my friend with medium olive skin. \n\n**Overall opinion:** I’ve tried so many mineral sunscreens, and this is the only one so far that does not dry out my very dry, sensitive, eczema-prone skin. Their customer service is also amazingly friendly and they ship within one business day of placing your order.",

It's seems like the best ingredients for the job are silicones which create a protective layer around the hair. Most people are worried about buildup when it comes to too much silicone but in my case I'm actually looking to create build up as protection. Does anybody know of any products that contain Dimethicone, Dimethiconol and Amodimethicone? I'm intending to drench my hair in them and then apply coconut oil before getting in the surf. If anybody has any suggestions or ideas in line with this let me know! ",

        "body": "So I don't have a complete answer for you, but I can share some insights to help inform your decision on how best to protect your hair. \n\nYou might be interested in [this informal experiment](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/your-hair-on-chlorine.html) by a soil scientist that tested the protective ability of olive oil, coconut oil, a conditioner with silicones, and one without silicones in chlorinated water (I realize sea water isn't exactly the same as chlorine though).  Both types of conditioner and the coconut oil provided good protection for at least 30 minutes (that was the maximum time she tested it); the olive oil wasn't as long-lasting.\n\nI think it's interesting that in the informal experiment, the conditioners with and without silicones both performed equally well.  It might have something to do with the specific formulations of the conditioners used in those experiments, but I think it's worth noting that some of the reputation that silicones have for buildup isn't exactly true.  There are a wide variety of silicones with different levels of \"clinginess\" or washability.  There are other ingredients such as cationic ingredients which can have an even stronger hold on the hair.  Amodimethicone marries the benefits of silicones (water-resistance, slip) with the extra \"stickiness\" that comes from being cationic. Bis-aminopropyl dimethicone is another that is cationic. Take a look at the silicones guide for the sub, I'd suggest focusing on the silicones listed in [Group 3 & 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/).  But one thing that Michelle Wong has pointed out about conditioners is that [they usually form tiny blobs on the hair](https://youtu.be/gLttCDPCADY?si=Jit1qP2jzaJWJAp3&t=1484) rather than a continuous film.  This still works fine to provide conditioning in most situations, but it might not be sufficient when the hair is immersed in water and/or exposed to a lot of humidity from the evaporation and splashes.  In [this article](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2017/05/humidity-resistant-hair-styling-products.html) about ingredients that provide humidity-resistance for the hair, some of them just provide hold to keep the style in place despite the water entering the hair, but some of them will include film-forming ingredients such as acrylates polymers to keep the water out in the first place.  I think you should consider finding a product with [film-forming ingredients](https://cosmileeurope.eu/inci/substancegroup/61/film-forming-agents/).  This was just from a comment discussing the active ingredient in Living Proof products which is patented, octafluoropentyl methacrylate, but there are other acrylates polymers, such as those listed in the article about humidity resistance.  There's another comment about coconut oil that notes that the medium-chain fatty acids in coconut oil are polar, they have the same \"stickiness\" as other cationic ingredients do to damaged areas of the hair especially, which might be part of what made coconut oil successful in her experiment with chlorinated water.\n\n[This study on elite Japanese swimmers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11092265/) may also be helpful; it tried to determine what exactly the mechanism of damage is from swimming seemed to point to the friction between the hair and the water being a major element of it.  I'm sure as a surfer you know that water is heavy and can apply quite a bit of force on you, and that force is being applied to your hair as well.  In the study, the friction from high-speed swimming literally removed the protective cuticles of the hair, leaving the cortex (where the melanin that gives hair its natural color) resides, as well as the keratin that gives it structure.  Sometimes hair that's seriously damaged from chemical treatments and styling can also be missing the cuticle, or at least parts of it, so products formulated for chemically damaged hair will use a higher amount of cationic conditioning agents, because they are going to be better at sticking to the exposed keratin of the damaged hair.\n\n(I'm close to the comment size limit so I'll continue in another comment)",

(has amodimethicone, and divinyldimethiconedimethicone copolymer) as well as pg-propyl silanetriol but that is claimed to be water soluable on the olaplex website. \n\n3 months ago i cut like 6 inches off my hair. now it is an inch below shoulder length, and it was a huge mistake because my hair isn’t curling as much still and my long hair was sooo curly. i think it was in curl shock for awhile but now it is curling better as it grows, it just looks weird and wavy and won’t clump or make a pattern correctly. before, i had a long layered shag that brought out my curls beautifully. 2c-3b hair. my hair doesn’t spiral until midway through the length, doesn’t curl at the top. i think i have low porosity. i have thick hair but its not coarse. anyways i’m not sure what to do because i don’t want to waste this product. but i’m wondering if it will give me the same effect that olaplex did. maybe my hair actually likes silicones?

I just use a gentle shampoo more often to keep it from getting weighed down too much. Olaplex probably worked for you because it’s lightweight. NYM didn’t do me any favors personally, it left my hair somehow dry and weighed down. If you don’t have a routine that really works for you, it wouldn’t hurt to try the products and just give them to another friend/relative if they don’t work for you. There’s also a page on here for exchanging opened but barely used products, not sure what it’s called though but if they don’t work for you that’s another option.",

I think 5% or *maybe* 10% is the sweet spot as this will be a face cream and it seems higher percentages are used largely on hardened or calloused skin.\n\n**Eucerin Replenishing Face Creme** seems like a good choice.  5% urea, first ingredient is water so it looks hydrating and has some lactic acid.  Fragrance-free, non comedogenic and apparently listed as a light moisturizer.  $9.4 an ounce.\n\n-  Aqua, Urea, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Triisostearin, Cetyl Alcohol, Sodium Lactate, Glyceryl Stearate, Benzyl Alcohol, PEG-40 Stearate, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Methylparaben, Lactic Acid, Lanolin Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Eucerin Complete Repair Moisturizing Lotion**.  Now this is meant for body use, but...  it looks so similar.  5% urea, some ceramide-3.  NMFs and Gluco-glycerol.  Water is first ingredient again so should be moisturizing.  Fragrance free as well.  Here's the real selling point $1.5/oz.\n\n-  Aqua, Glycerine, Ureum, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Glucoside, Cyclomethicone, Sodium Lactate, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Methylpropanediol, Octyldodecanol, Dicaprylyl Ether, Tapioca Starch, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Carnitine, Ceramide-3, Sodium PCA, Arginine HCL, Serine, Alanine, Histidine, Citrulline, Lysine, Lactic Acid, Sodium Chloride, Dimethiconol, Glycogen, Mannitol, Sucrose, Glutamic Acid, Threonine, Chondrus Crispus, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol\n\nI guess I'd love any guidance on either lotion.  Compare/contrast and experiences welcome.  As are any other urea moisturizer ideas.  Thanks SCA!",

I love the day cream, I've been using it a month and I think it's great. I haven't had a flaky face since I started which was a real issue for me before, it's really helped calm my skin in general. It's moisturizing enough for me that I think it's a little much for twice a day and will be using toleraine fluid in the mornings and the eucerin at night once my new bottle comes in. \n\nThe main difference I can see between the two you mention seems to be that the one designed for faces has silicones, so your face would feel nice and soft and smooth after using it (I've got no idea about the other ingredients in the body one, sorry). \n\nThings designed for dry skin on the body tend to be greasy, so there could be a real difference in how your skin feels and looks after putting each of them on, and might affect the way your makeup sits if you wear it.

    "body": "Hi fellow skincare addicts\n26 year old guy here. I've been experimenting with a lot of different products and brands and have come up with this as my current routine. I am still not all that good at determining how good a product is. My skin is combination, and generally clear but I've been having some breakouts lately, and have therefore decided to try a new skincare regimen:\n\nLa Roche-Posay: Effaclar Purifying Foaming Gel\nLa Roche-Posay: Effaclar Duo Dual Action Acne Treatment\nLa Roche-Posay: Active C Eyes\nClarins: Sunscreen for Face Wrinkle Control Cream SPF 50+\n\nWhat do you think of it so far? I am also in need of a new moisturizer and was thinking of La Roche-Posay XY HOMME HYDRATING BARRIER GEL. The ingredients are as follows: \nAQUA\nALCOHOL DENAT.\nCYCLOHEXASILOXANE\nGLYCERIN\nBIS-PEG-18 METHYL ETHER DIMETHYL SILANE\nCYCLOPENTASILOXANE\nHYDROXYETHYLPIPERAZINE ETHANE SULFONIC ACID\nSODIUM HYDROXIDE\nTHERMUS THERMOPHILLUS FERMENT\nCHLORPHENESIN\nPOLYSORBATE 80\nDIMETHICONOL\nMANGANESE GLUCONATE\nXANTHAN GUM\nISOHEXADECANE\nCAPRYLYL GLYCOL\nCARBOMER\nACRYLAMIDE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE COPOLYMER\nPARFUM\n\nOr the second choice, being La Roche-Posay XY HOMMEANTI-REDNESS NORMALIZING BALM, the ingredients of which are: AQUA / WATER\nCYCLOHEXASILOXANE\nGLYCERIN\nISOHEXADECANE\nZEA MAYS STARCH / CORN STARCH\nSORBITAN STEARATE\nPROPYLENE GLYCOL\nSTEARYL ALCOHOL\nSUCROSE COCOATE\nHYDROXYETHYLPIPERAZINE ETHANE SULFONIC ACID\nPOLOXAMER 338\nALLANTOIN\nCHLORPHENESIN\nPOLYSORBATE 80\nAMMONIUM POLYACRYLDIMETHYLTAURAMIDE / AMMONIUM POLYACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE\nXANTHAN GUM\nCAPRYLYL GLYCOL\nACRYLAMIDE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE COPOLYMER\nROSA GALLICA EXTRACT / ROSA GALLICA FLOWER EXTRACT\nCITRIC ACID\nPARFUM / FRAGRANCE\n\nI realize its a lot from the same brand, but I have in general had pretty good success from them and was recommended it by my dermatologist a few years ago.\n\nThanks for your help! Sorry if this has been confusing, I feel so lost!",

    "body": "[Hair Oils](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-oils.html)\n\nI have been on a search to understand which oils penetrated the hair which does not. I hope you can find the right oil for you too! For me the answer was sunflower. Coconut-derived oil ingredients, which is in most products, do not work as well for my hair. This is the entire blog post but if you would rather see it a bit more organized check out [Hair Oils](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-oils.html). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Types of Oils**  \n*Vegetable Oils*  \n[These oils](https://cosmeticsandtoiletries.texterity.com/cosmeticsandtoiletries/june_2021/MobilePagedReplica.action?pm=1&folio=24#pg35) are pressed, crushed and refined from the fatty portions of a plant or botanical. They are less aromatic and have the ability to sink into your hair shaft, unlike mineral oils, which can make them a more effective moisturizing ingredient depending on your needs.   \n\n\n*Mineral Oils*  \nThese oils are made from petroleum that is [highly refined](https://www.chemicalsafetyfacts.org/mineral-oil/). They have a lower price point compared to vegetable oils and essential oils, which can influence which brands will include them in product formulas. They're known to create a barrier on the surface of your hair shaft to lock moisture in.  \n\n\n*Essential Oils*  \nThese oils are [distilled](https://www.thezoereport.com/p/oils-vs-essential-oils-the-biggest-differences-the-most-popular-uses-more-19442788) from leaves, roots, bark and other aromatic portions of plants. The distillation process turns the raw ingredients left over into a more concentrated, highly aromatic oil. They're used for their smell and are thought to have therapeutic benefits, but will irritate your skin if not heavily diluted with mineral or vegetable oils.   \n\n\n*Silicone (not an oil)*  \nWhile not technically an oil, silicone provides conditioning qualities that are similar. There are two types to be aware of: (1) soluble and (2) non-soluble. The main difference between them is that one can be broken down by water and the other cannot, meaning it requires harsher shampoos with surfactants to wash it away after continued use. You can tell the difference between them based on their ingredients, which I've listed below. You can also read more about silicones in my posts [*How Often Should I Shampoo?*](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html) and [*Ingredient Lists*](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-ingredient-lists.html). ​ ​​\n\n* Non-soluble: Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Amodimethicone, Pheryl trimethicone, Ceteraryl methicone, Dimethiconol, Stearyl dimethicone, Amodimethicone (non-soluble when Trideceth-12 and Cetrimonium Chloride are absent)\n* Soluble: Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone copolyol, Lauryl methicone copolyol, any silicone with PEG as a prefix\n\n**Oils for Hair with High Porosity vs. Low Porosity**   \n​Finding the right oil for your hair texture can be challenging, but if you can identify the porosity of your hair it will help guide the process. Genetics and they way you care for your hair are the biggest influencers of its porosity. Styling tools with high heat, coloring, perming and other hair care/services can cause your porosity to change. Although the signs of highly porous hair are not widely considered “healthy looking”, the benefit for some can be more volume and fullness.  \n\n\nHair with low porosity is considered to be “healthy”, but it comes with its own challenges. According to the [Science-y Hair Blog](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/oils-which-ones-soak-in-vs-coat-hair.html) “If you have fine or soft hair which is easily over-conditioned, those same oils may make your hair feel greasy and lank unless used in very small amounts. Lower porosity hair may do better with blends of penetrating oils and less-penetrating oils.” The chart below will help you determine your porosity and show you what oils have been found to \"[penetrate the cortex](https://cosmeticsandtoiletries.texterity.com/cosmeticsandtoiletries/july_august_2021/MobilePagedReplica.action?pm=1&folio=DM5#pg51)\", or the second layer of your hair shaft that sits behind your outer cuticle. Your porosity level is a good thing to keep in mind when searching for new hair products.\n\n**Signs of Hair with** **High Porosity****Signs of Hair with** **Low Porosity**\n\nHair that is: \n\n* Dry, rough and /or dull\n* Full with volume\n* Coarser than usual (generally on the ends)\n* Tangling easily\n* Experiencing breakage\n* Air drying within 15 minutes\n* Soaking up oil-based products quickly \n\nFor oil treatments, use **penetrating oils** on your ends  and a **mix of less penetrating oils plus penetrating oils** from your roots to mid hair shaft\n\nHair that is:\n\n* Smooth and sleek\n* Flat and lacking volume\n* Heavier with a slick/greasy feel\n* Easily combed or brushed \n* Not experiencing breakage\n* Taking 30 minutes or more to air dry\n* Unable to soak up oil-based products easily\n\n​  \nFor oil treatments, mix  **penetrating** and  **less penetrating** oils.  \n​  \n​*Sources:* [*Enhancing Hair Health: Effects of Oiling, Inside and Out - Part I*](https://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/research/literature-data/article/21836362/cosmetics-and-toiletries-magazine-enhancing-hair-health-effects-of-oiling-inside-and-outpart-i)*, Cosmetics & Toiletries*  \n[*Enhancing Hair Health: Effects of Oiling, Inside and Out - Part II*](https://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/research/literature-data/article/21836386/cosmetics-and-toiletries-magazine-enhancing-hair-health-effects-of-oiling-inside-and-outpart-ii)*, Cosmetics & Toiletries*  \n[*Oils - Which Ones Soak in vs. Coat the Hair?*](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/oils-which-ones-soak-in-vs-coat-hair.html)*, Science-y Hair Blog*  \n[*Beginner's Guide to Ingredients in Natural Hair Products*](https://www.texturedtalk.com/how-to-understand-ingredients-in-natural-hair-products/) *, Textured Talk*  \n[*15 Scientific Names for Common Ingredients in Natural Hair Products*](http://www.1blessednatural.com/2015/10/15-scientific-names-for-common-ingredients-natural-hair-products.html)*, 1Blessed  Natural Mag*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Penetrating Oils**​\n\nCoconut *(Cocos Nucifera)* Oil   \n​Sunflower *(Helianthus Annuus)* Seed Oil Olive *(Olea Europaea)* Oil\n\n  \n**Less Penetrating Oils**\n\nArgan *(Argania Spinosa)*\n\n**Not Recommended** \n\nMineral Oil   \nJojoba *(Simmondsia Chinensis)* Oil",
