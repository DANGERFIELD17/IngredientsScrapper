I was getting gout flareups weekly.  What I did worked and I suggest trying it to save you some pain.\n\n1 - Cut any kind of drink except water.  No soda, no beer (I'll get to that later).  After a few weeks of only drinking water it becomes second nature.  I also think this is how I lost 30 of the 42lbs.  I prefer room temp water.\n\n2 - No processed food and if I do, major moderation.  That means lots of baby carrots and tomatoes.  I also am a pretty big pothead, munchies are inevitable.  For that, at night when I get munchies, I'll only allow myself air popped popcorn.  It's easy and it cures the late night cravings. Eat as much as you want, you'll poop it out later.\n\n3 - Lots of vitamins.  I buy them on Amazon and get them cheap.  I pre-sort them out in baggies and set a daily reminder in my phone.  I take\nTart Cherry Extract\nCelery Seed extract\nFish oil\nTumeric\nVitamin C\nSuper Vitamin B complex\nApple Cider vinegar pill \nSt John's Wart\nIt may add up but it's a hell of alot cheaper in Dr visits and time taken off work.\n\nThat's it.  It's working for me.  Moderation is a big key.  I know pretty much what triggers my flareups.  It doesn't mean I have sworn them off, it just means I won't eat a giant steak one night and shellfish the next.  Also I'll still drink but I stick to ciders, wine etc... No cheap beer, that hits me hard.\n\nI wish you all the best of luck and I feel your pain.  You've got this!",

I have accepted it  but I am going to fight it as much as possible. \n\nI’m a pharmacist, and own a medical clinic I have spent the last month doing extensive research into this disease state model and I have the following recommendations to help prolong QOL (I am putting my dad on all of the below)… I compound for a living so I was able to source some materials..we may launch something called project hope to help a few number of ALS patients get on TUDCA/Sodium phenylbutyrate, but not until I can make sure I won’t have any troubles getting ahold of more sodium phenylbutyrate and TUDCA.\n\nDads current regimen starting tomorrow. \n\nRiluzole 50mg BID\n\nTUDCA and sodium phenylbutyrate and am copying the dosing of 1g/3g BID for AMX0035 (the current treatment in phase 3 trials) \n\nGlutathione - 300mg daily - fights oxidative stress (been shown to possibly maintain muscle strength longer in a few studies) \n\nCarnitine - 300-600mg daily (aids in mitochondrial function… not much evidence for this, but it’s not going to hurt your situation or make things worse) \n\nConsidering celebrex therapy with ciprofloxacin (PrimeC) been having a very hard time looking up there exact fixed dosages in there trials/patients … celebrex alone hasn’t been shown to do anything but in theory it’s MOA is to protect from neuroinflammation \n\nMontelukast 10mg daily - GPR17 regulation (and my dad has a history of asthma so a 2 for 1 treatment for him) some early research has shown GPR17 up regulation in patients with ALS and montelukast helps regulate \n\nCurcumin doesn’t really matter what brand and  I’m using theracurcumin - curcumins been shown in independent research to help with protein folding \n\nCelery seed extract (butylpthalide) - some studies show that the MOA shows some reduced neuronal death progression.\n\nEMS machine - going to put it on his stomach, neck, legs, arms for 20minute at a time daily. \n\nTbh you can take any other multivitamins and supplements ontop of the above. I have been giving my dad the healthiest food I can find as well (salmon, meat ect) \n\nOverall, there is a lot going on in the space which is nice to see, I hope in the next decade there will be a treatment that would slow progression enough to help people live an extra 5-10 years of good QOL or even something that could reverse degeneration (CRISPR/Gene editing, targeted stem cell treatment, artificial nerve implantations (Elon musk should take charge of this one) \n\nMy dad wasn’t eligible for edaravone in our province and it’s 250k out of pocket here in Canada… my clinic/pharmacy is a new startup so I don’t have much money either and I’m spending anything I have to help my dad fight and make ends meet at home. \n\nSending love to everyone out there going through this. Creating hope for others is important in these forums, and a little guidance in treatment helps,  I will work on project hope and hopefully I can help others get on TUDCA and sodium phenylbutyrate until AMX0035 comes to market .",

    "body": "First some background:\n\nI just turned 31, am healthy and in pretty good shape (6'1,180lb.), work out semi-regularly, and have a penchant for over-eating delicious food and drinking vast quantities of beer.  Ummm beer. \n\nIt all started in late April in the lead-up to my birthday when my fiance and I celebrated for the entire week eating rich food and drinking far too much with neighbors and friends.  On the evening of my birthday, a good amount of us went out for all-you-can-eat sushi (Sushi Hunter in North Beach San Francisco - highly recommended for an AYCE sushi joint) AND all-you-can-drink sake.  Needless to say, a ludicrous amount of sushi was eaten and sake drunk, with a few 22 oz. Sapporos mixed in for good measure.  Luckily, our apartment is close by and we stumbled/waddled home without incident.\n\nThe next day, the joint in my left big toe was a bit sore which I attributed to walking around a bunch the previous day and likely hurting it in some fashion on the drunken walk home the night before.  I didn't think much of it as it didn't hurt too badly and just felt a little out of whack when walking.  To take the edge off, I proceeded to drink a 6 oz. flask of Rye while watching the Giants game on the telly, which in retrospect, was EXACTLY like pouring gasoline on a fire. \n\nFast-forward a few hours later to around 3 AM when I got a rude awakening from some invisible, marauding devil repeatedly jamming a sharp, barbed, red-hot, pain-poker directly into my big toe joint without letting up.  I seriously thought my foot was somehow broken as the pain was FUCKING INCREDIBLE and the entire top half of my foot was grotesquely red and swollen.  A surprising amount of heat emanated from the spot as well which I found to be curious/disconcerting.  A self-diagnosis of gout/podagra was quickly ascertained as my symptoms fit pretty neatly into various Google searches on the subject.\n\nTo make a long story short, I have NEVER experienced pain of this intensity in my life - I am completely sympathetic to those suffering from the same condition who contemplate cutting their foot off just to be done with it.  Luckily, I have an understanding neighbor who took pity on me and gave me a month's worth of Vicodin and Percocets left over from a recent shoulder surgery.  The opiates, coupled with obscene quantities of Advil (started calling them my M&M's), made the pain bearable during the day and allowed me to fitfully sleep at night.  After resisting for 3 weeks with slowly diminishing symptoms, I finally went to a doctor who said it was generally uncommon for gout to persist that long and proceeded to give me a 5-day course of prednisone as treatment.\n\nThat seemed to do the trick as the swelling started to decrease the next day and the pain became more tolerable allowing me to get off the pills, which was a good thing since I was close to running out at that point.  3 weeks later, I'm about 95% healed, finally off the crutch/cane, and walk without a noticeable limp.  My foot now looks nearly identical to my other, non-afflicted foot, but with a bit of red bump sticking out from the side of my afflicted joint.  The pain has subsided completely while at rest and now only twinges a bit while walking - completely acceptable compared to the situation just a few weeks prior when I literally had to hop around just to get anywhere.\n\nAnyway, it seems I have survived my first battle with gout with my sanity intact and I wanted to share what I learned from this (horrible) experience:\n\nA)  There is a staggering amount of conflicting/confusing/contradictory information out there on the Internets, especially when it comes to modifying one's diet WHILE suffering an attack.  The only consistent info I could find regarded the general cause of gout - chronic hyperuricemic condition (too much uric acid from either producing too much or excreting too little) leading to a deposit of uric acid crystals in (a) specific joint(s) - usually the big toe.  So, diagnosis and analysis of my condition was relatively straight-forward, especially when considering the factors leading up to my attack - sushi/booze/years of overindulgence.  However, that is where the easy-info path ended and the arduous task of navigating the gout-diet labyrinth began.\n\nAny article or guide to dealing with gout via diet modification begins the same way: Gout is caused by a build-up of uric acid.  Uric acid is formed from compounds called purines that your body may have a hard time excreting.  Here are the foods that are high in purines:  STOP.  This is where the various sites/articles/pamphlets begin to diverge GREATLY in their advice or recommendations.  Websites tied to the Mayo Clinic will diverge from the University of Maryland Medical Center will diverge from the American Medical Association will diverge from LiveStrong will diverge from Goutpal, etc. etc. etc.\n\nThere is overlap on the lists but these instances are rarely consistent.\n\nThe ONLY consistent food/drink that I found on the various banned lists were game meats, red meat, shellfish, and alcohol (with an emphasis on beer sadly).  If one were to avoid ALL of the foods on the various lists, there would literally be NOTHING to eat.  I'm not joking either as nearly EVERYTHING has something negative associated with gout.  This is not hyperbolic in any sense.\n\nFor example, a gout sufferer can eat almonds as they are generally good for you and are very low in purines.  BUT, they are also high in niacin (vitamin B3) which can inhibit uric acid excretion.  Argh.\n\nOr, eat a bunch of berries, especially cherries, as they are high in compounds called anthocyanins, along with other anti-oxidants and flavonoids purported to be good for inflammation and other various ailments.  Pineapple too as it has high amounts of bromelain, another compound good for inflammation. BUT, these foods are high in sugar, especially fructose, which I have found on various sites to be the absolute devil for gout.  Ugh.\n\nOr, eat some tomatoes as they're low in purines and high in Vitamin C, which I have also found on various sites to be helpful.  BUT, they are also very high in oxalates which are generally thought to impact kidney stone sufferers more but MAY also play a role in gout.  FML\n\nThis is THE WORST PART when suffering your first gout attack.  What the hell are you supposed to eat if nearly EVERYTHING is bad for you?  And without a consistent hierarchy of 'badness' to boot!  So glad I had a copious amount of pain-killers at this point....\n\nAdditionally, the merits of various gout diets were suspect as well.  Paleo diet?  Isn't eating a bunch of meat (very high in purines), seeds (high in purines), vegetables (some high in purines like asparagus, avocado, brussel sprouts, mushrooms, etc.), and nuts (high in compounds like niacin that may inhibit UA excretion) bad for gout???\n\nOr conversely, avoid meat altogether and focus on eating mostly starchy foods like pasta, bread, or potatoes?  I can't tell you how many sites I've found telling me THIS was the wrong path to go down. \n\nNeedless to say, the search to compile an acceptable list of foods to consume was MADDENING.  After eating nothing but cereal, milk, carrots, and cherries for the first 4 days, along with salads at night with 'low-purine vegetables', I decided that nobody really knows what the hell they are talking about and gout is far too idiosyncratic a condition to resolve when trying to craft an 'acceptable' diet.\n\nNow, I have no clue if this worked or not as my symptoms didn't really start to subside until I went to the doctor and took some prednisone, but this is the diet I eventually settled on and continue to use to this day:\n\nNo booze of any kind, no meat of any kind.  Lots of fresh fruits, vegetables, and nuts regardless of purine/oxalate/niacin/etc. content.  Lots of dairy as well - milk, yogurt, cheese.  Also, I'm generally staying away from wheat (without being crazy about it) and peanuts as these both seem to have inflammation implications. \n\nBasically, I turned into a non-drinking vegetarian which is kind of insane when looking at the previous 15 or so years of eating and drinking whatever I wanted at any time.  So be it - sure beats having the devil come back into my toe and walking around with a cane like a much older man.  However, I'm starting to think about testing the waters again with meat and/or booze albeit with some needed 'moderation'.  Going to have to get used to that word, mod-er-at-ion, as I used to consider it a pejorative term....oh well.\n\n\nB)  There seems to be some correlation between low vitamin D and gout.  The doctor pointed out that I had low vitamin D levels and suggested I take a supplement.  The advice has some merit it seems from a gout perspective:\n\nhttp://goutandyou.com/gout-and-vitamin-d/\n\nInteresting that gout is more prevalent in northern latitudes with attacks more common in the spring (when vitamin D levels are lowest in the population aggregate).\n\nEven if there is no direct link between vitamin D and gout, it still seems to be a pretty crucial vitamin for a number of processes and it's probably not bad to correct for a deficiency if you have one.\n\n\nC)  Breakfast is important.  I used to only have coffee for breakfast and generally wouldn't eat anything until about 2-3 PM every day - don't know why but I have just never been hungry in the mornings.  Unfortunately, this plays right into gout's hand as your body starts to break down muscle for energy and produces ketone bodies and lactic acid as byproducts - these 2 compounds inhibit the kidneys' ability to excrete uric acid....you know the rest.  Additionally, 'accidental fasting' as it's called, throws your potassium balance out of whack which has also been implicated in gout occurrence.\n\nD)  Socks while sleeping may help.  It seems that the reason the majority of gout attacks happen at night is due to uric acid coming out of solution in the blood and forming into crystals when your body temperature drops a few degrees - what generally happens to everyone while they are sleeping.  Keeping a pair of socks on at night may help your feet retain a few degrees of heat which may prove crucial for the mitigation of uric acid crystal formation.  Not sure if this actually helps, but the theory seems sound and it probably doesn't hurt.\n\nE)  The various 'cures' I have found to have a bit more merit than others (on my own biased scale).  In no particular order:\n\nCherries (tart are preferable?!?!, black, bing, sweet, extract, juice, pills, all good it seems), Bromelain (found in pineapples), Quercetin, Potassium Citrate, Apple Cider Vinegar (good with maple syrup, others like honey), devil's claw root, cat's claw root, celery seed extract, turmeric, dairy products, vitamin D.\n\nI take nearly all of these now and also drink a bunch of water on a daily basis.\n\nF)  Gout sucks (an understatement to say the least) but it does get better.  To everyone losing hope that they'll never walk normally again - don't worry.  It might take some time but eventually your attack will subside and you can start to think about returning to a normal routine, albeit with some needed modifications.  A gout attack is a wake-up call that something is seriously out of whack with your body.  The sooner that you recognize this and take some basic steps to correct for the problem, the better you will be in the long run.  Also, I found a few studies linking elevated uric acid levels to lower risk for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease - so I guess there is a silver lining here!?!?\n\nI'm probably forgetting a few things but I hope everyone who has read this far found some nugget of info that has proved helpful.

It's weird to me that so many are afraid of Allo.

Best course of action (again, just my opinion) is a combination of Allo and supplements.\n\nJust my two cents.",

Since I've been diagnosed I've been on and off allopurinol and have tried every home remedy I could find: celery seed extract, cherries, bromelain, baking soda, apple cider vinegar, black bean broth, various supplements... you name it. I've tried dieting, juicing and even fasted. Most of these had no effect on my gout; some only alleviated my symptoms or delayed the period between attacks and some even made it worse but nothing really got rid of it completely. That is until I started drinking stinging nettle tea.\n\nI stumbled upon stinging nettle after researching natural kidney supplements during a nasty flare up. I bought a bag of nettle loose tea on Amazon and prepared my first batch of tea. Upon drinking my first dose my flare up seemed to have intensified however it felt as if the crystals were dissolving in my toe at a rapid rate. I drank about 3 liters of of tea that day and amazingly the next morning I awoke gout free. My foot was still a bit sore from the three week gout attack but the sharp pain was gone. I was elated and continued drinking the tea. In the first two weeks I felt that tingling sensation of crystals dissolving; its sort of like that twitch you feel before you get a full on gout attack. After that the sensation subsided and my gout symptoms never returned.\n\nI stumbled onto this subreddit many times during my years battling gout and it's given me support and comfort when I was feeling ill. I waited until now to post this because I wasn't sure if it was the stinging nettle or other factors that affected my gout. For a year now I've been depending solely on nettle tea and have not had a single attack. I've been decreasing my dosage gradually and now I drink maybe a cup a week.\n\nI wanted to share this with /r/gout to put it out there as there is little to no resources on the net about stinging nettle and its effects on kidney health and gout. I want to put this out there to encourage discussion of this little known remedy and to possibly help others out. I'll answer any questions if you have 'em. It worked for me and hopefully it will work for anyone who may want to try it. Gout is a terrible, terrible affliction and I'm so glad to have rid of it. I hope all of you will find whatever works for you if not stinging nettle then something else.\n\nGood luck.",

The worst ones I had were right before I started using stinging nettle tea and those two lasted for almost a month and I felt like I was in hell. I'm currently 27 and I stopped drinking alcohol when I was 22 right around the time of my diagnosis. \n\nAn update: I did indulge in a little bit of overeating before and after Thanksgiving and unfortunately packed on a few extra pounds. Needless to say I felt that familiar gout-is-coming-for-you twinge in the bunion of my right foot and also in the ankle about four days after. I panicked and brewed a pot of the tea to drink throughout the day. I've been drinking about one pot every two days now and miraculously no gout attack. \n\nSo this pretty good news even though gout reared its head again. It reaffirms my confidence in nettle as my go to treatment for gout. In the past almost always I would get a full blown gout massacre when I felt the early tingling twinge no matter what I took whether it be bromelain or an entire bottle of cherry extract. Now I can just take the tea and it'll be fine the next day. \n\nI really really really hope this works for you when you try it. If you have any questions send me a message.

Had my first bad flare 1.5 weeks ago, like a lot of people, been dealing with it for more than year, thought I pulled something in my foot, arches were going bad, something, but not Gout. Ice would make it feel better by the next day. I have mild psoriasis so I have dealt with inflammation for years, just another day. \n\nAs a side hustle/hobby I train a few hunting dogs and guide Pheasant hunts, 40lbs over weight but \"carry\" it well, people are so nice. I could run several dogs and guide 4-5 guys, walk all day in the field. I am not healthy but not really unhealthy, just halfway unhealthy, I exercise and guide so I can eat tacos, drink margaritas and buy dogfood. This past year, after a half day in the field my foot would hurt but then get better by evening, need new boots for support right? Full day and I was going to need lots of ice and ibuprofen, good to go. Last hunt I did was a warm day and a long day, then had tacos and margaritas for dinner.\n\nThe combo of being really dehydrated and several margaritas did me in, now I know. Went to Urgent care and got a shot of something for inflammation, prednisone and NSAIDS. Seeing my doc next week to get started on dealing with this. I've already cut alcohol, sugar, High fructose Corn Syrup, reduced meat, increased veggies, taking Cherry extract, Celery seed extract, Vitamin C, ACV, drink a gallon of water a day, etc. Diet can't cure it but it sure as hell can make it worse. \n\nThe pain completely convinced me I needed to make a change, it has been so motivating. All I can say was the pain was amazingly intense, can't describe it any other way. There are hurts, owies, ouches and so many different pains. Gout is amazing in that it does it's job so damn well, anything that can make us say \"Dear god get the sheet off my foot!!\" or \"Turn the fan off I can feel the air!\" has my respect. I truly felt as if my toenail was going to blow off the top of my toe.\n\nFor any new people searching for \"Why does my big toe hurt?\", drink your water and get your UA tested.\n\nFor all of you that have been here longer, thanks for blazing the trail! We can limp it together now.\n\nTLDR; First flare, intense pain, drink your water. So yeah, this has been a fun and interesting 2 weeks.",

    "body": "TL;DR: Advocate to be tested sooner than later- change your diets and be mindful of what you eat/drink- those changes help a little- start TAKING ALLO ASAP!\n\nBeen lurking for quite sometime. Recently had some wins and wanted to share. In the summer of 2021 I was headed out to a show w/ some friends. Exiting their house and walking down their front steps to the car I jumped off last step. I landed kinda funny. Was wearing new shoes. \nI get to the show. Lots of time on my feet and drinking. Next day I wake up in the most pain I’ve ever had in my ankle. Rest, ice, compression & kept it elevated. After 6 days I go to Urgent Care. My brother in law has gout and my sister encouraged me to ask about that while there. \nDoc refused to test me. Said I would be in more pain. I have a pretty high tolerance for pain. Told it is soft tissue damage probably and to give it another week. Pain subsides. \nI’m late November of 2022 I’m doing some house work up on a ladder and step off it funny. Same ankle as “soft tissue damage” from year+ prior. \nSwelling. Even more pain. 2 weeks go by. I keep telling myself this is the same thing I dealt with in ‘21- it should pass. It doesn’t. Foot is swollen. Unable to sleep. Slightest brush of a blanket on my foot wakes me up. I crawl downstairs and lay on floor and put foot up on my couch and try to sleep. \nI go back to Urgent Care. X-Rays, ultra sound nothing showing up. 5hrs there and I beg for a fluid draw to test for gout. They are unable to draw fluid from my foot and send me to the ER. \n4 hrs later while at ER get a fresh new doc in residency who draws fluid. \nI take some antibiotics via IV in case of infection. Results get back and indicated crystals suggesting elevated uric acid- I probably have gout, will need uric acid levels checked by PCP. This is December 8th 2022. \nI change my diet. I start losing weight. I’m taking tart Cherry w/ celery seed extract gummies. I stop drinking beer. I finally go to PCP and get tested for gout in FEB 2023. \nI’m at 9.2!!! This is after almost 2.5 months. Who knows how high it actually was before measures I had already taken. \nI get put on 100mg of Allo. I continue to eat better and avoid beer. Allowing myself some gin and red wine occasionally. Well holy cow- 1 month later and my levels are at a 6!!!\nI’ve been having a bunch of flares as my body is purging old crystals. Have been on prednisone for a particularly painful flare up in my left wrist. I’ve now had flare ups in both feet, ankles, right knee, left wrist, shoulder and hips. \nI allowed myself some tasty craft beers last night w/ a burger and onion rings!!! I’ll continue to eat healthier, NOT overindulge in processed foods, fried foods and beers. The changes in my cholesterol alone (was on a statin- no longer need one!) making theses lifestyle changes well worth it. \nPretty upsetting that I probably have been dealing w/ gout on some level for the last 5yrs when I think back to old injuries. Disappointing that Urgent Care visit in 2021 docs wouldn’t test me. \nIT GETS BETTER! Cheers to all of you going through this. May your next flare ups be short and mitigated by ibuprofen!",

Your point about drinking craft beer is worrying. Don’t drink any beer. It’s the absolute worst thing, it can be so tempting but it’s best not to even in allo I think. I find a Gin and Tonic ok and occasional wine. Be interesting to hear what others think about beer on allo. Hope your journey keeps getting better.

Intuitively, it seems like it could because an injection seems to bypass the stomach, but I don't know enough to say for sure.

I'm actually starting to wonder whether prednisone is an option going forward, because I was told that NSAIDs are probably out for me, but I don't remember the doctor saying that about Prednisone.  \n\nI waited way too long to get on allopurinol because I did manage to take care of my gout attacks to a significant degree by lifestyle changes and losing weight many years ago, but things got worse for me again after awhile - lost my way on some of the lifestyle changes - so I recently got the prescription for allopurinol as gout attacks became more frequent, and I was ready to start. But soon thereafter, which was about 5 weeks ago, I had a kidney stone and ulcer in the same week and was hospitalized for awhile (because I puked up so much blood from the ulcer). Since I got out of the hospital, I've been wanting to start the allopurinol, but I kind of wanted to wait until I knew the ulcer was healed (will be getting an endoscopy two months after ulcer was discovered to determine this) in case the allopurinol triggered a gout attack and I needed to take Prednisone, because I didn't want to be in that situation. \n\nAnd yet here I am .... \n\nI get your point on the opioids - they did help for the kidney stone, so I was wondering if they were an option here. \n\nAlso, I'm probably much (much) older than you and most redditors, so let this be a lesson to everybody here: take care of and address your health issues early as best as you can, because the older you get, the more things like kidney stones and ulcers and gout will develop and pile up on each other.",

But last night I started flaring worse than I have in over a year. It was improved a little this morning, but I called my rheumatologist to make sure I could have a prednisone scrip in my back pocket just in case. This evening the flare got worse again and I had to start that prescription.\n\nTurns out he only gave me a 4 mg dose of methylprednisalone, which is apparently equivalent to 5 mg of pred. (That's. 4 mg pee pill, starting at 2 a day.) I've handled 20 mg per pill of pred before with no problem; this is like trying to swat a tiger with a feather. Meanwhile I've started naproxen for the first time hoping to get ahead of this. So far I'm still doing poorly.\n\nI've been on allo for 6 months, currently at 450 mg for about 2 months now. My uric acid levels have recently tested at 3.6 and 3.3 mg/dL in the mornings but my feet and ankles have been iffy right along. Taking 0.6 mg colchicine twice a day but I'm gonna bump that to twice a day starting tomorrow. And I'm chugging water like crazy, and taking way extra celery seed extract.\n\nThis sucks. I'm gonna have to call the doctor back tomorrow and insist on stronger treatment. In the meantime I have no idea how to handle the next few days.\n\nOh, and I would have given blood by now but the Red Cross has no openings for whole blood donation before Christmas. Plus the last time I tried to donate my BP was too high from meloxicam, so who knows what the naproxen will do.",

    "body": "Hi there. I was diagnosed with gout about 12 months ago. I've had three flare-ups total: The first and second were separated by about 8 months and I'm just now getting over the third, which happened earlier this month. I'm in good shape: I'm a former college athlete and fairly avid Brazilian Jiu Jitsu practitioner. I don't really eat red meat, though I do love shrimp, mussels and seafood. My three flare ups all occurred within days of a training session and drinking beer, so I'm curious if putting excess stress on my toe and then drinking in the days afterward is my biggest trigger. Colchicine and Prednisol work fine for treatment, and I just started taking cherry and celery extract everyday. \n\nBasically, I'm pretty freaked out. The pain is agonizing, and I'm scared of never really drinking with my friends again. Giving me more anxiety, my bachelor party is in a couple weeks, and drinking is basically going to be unavoidable. (I technically know I could not drink at my bachelor but that would be a huge disappointment). I'm fine with drinking not beer and sticking to tequila sodas, if need be. \n\nI'm curious about starting Allopurinol but wondering if I'm too young, and what the cons are to starting a lifelong medication like this at a relatively young age. I read the AMA with the gout doctor on this thread, and he said there's no longterm downsides to taking Allopurinol, only short term side effects. He also said that taking celery seed extract likely has no effect lowering on uric acid levels, and cherry is likely minimal in this regard. \n\nAnyway, I know that was a lot to digest but I'm really grateful for any feedback and insight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR\n\nI'm 29, just had a flare up and have my bachelor party in two weeks.\n\nCurious about longterm negative effects of allopurinol \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

This is, of course, my personal experience with it, and there are certainly folks out there who are allergic or do experience some of the uncommon side effects.  \n\nWith that said... starting it now, 2 weeks before your bachelor party, isn't going to do anything for you with regards to it.  The usual understood time-frame is 2-3 months for it to really settle in, AND during that time, you're prone to increased flares.  So, starting now is likely not a great idea if you don't plan to add an additional preventative.

Right now I feel better about my gout than I have for awhile... so I have complete trust in my rheumatologist and the long term plan.\n\nTL;DR: Everyone is different, but if you are able to take it, the vast amounts of scientific evidence as well as anecdotal stories from gout sufferers is that there are no long term negative affects to taking Allopurinol.",

    "body": "Long post warning! I'm dealing with pain in both feet and especially the ankles right now that's causing me a lot of problems over the last few weeks, and could use some advice.\n\n**Back story:** My first gout attack, henceforth called Attack Zero, was in March 2018 but I thought it was a sprain (outer front side of right foot) and it went away on its own. No redness, any swelling was barely visible if at all. Didn't have another attack until July 2019 the weekend after the 4th, but it was the exact same symptoms; this is Attack Prime. It was bad for a while, then got a little better, got bad again, better again, then moved to the left foot. Left foot got better, then worse, then the pain started alternating between ankles. In between the worst of these flares, my ankles felt extremely sore and strained as if I'd been injured, to the point where it was very difficult to walk. Prednisone calmed things down but it took several courses, and my GP also put me on meloxicam which helped, but every time I went off it (because he'd only prescribe 30 days at a time) I'd get worse again. Still, over the fall I got a lot better. Had a mini-flare in January, but it subsided. I couldn't get in to a rheumatologist as a new patient until early March 2020, and he diagnosed it as gout. Right after that visit the pain started returning. I was stupid and didn't go on allopurinol until mid-June: first 100 mg, then later 300 mg, with my rheumatologist giving me colchicine to prevent flaring.\n\n**Current \"flare\":** Until about 4 weeks ago I was on a longer-term course of meloxicam for 90 days. After that my pain, which had been fairly low-level but a constant annoyance, started to creep up again and my ankles felt strained once more, so I went back on meloxicam. I also sometimes felt a sharp pain in them and sometimes I'd have burning sensations in my feet. After a lot of back-and-forth with the rheumatologist's office because things kept getting worse, I had another visit. Prednisone was not helping this one, and even after changing to a different steroid nothing worked. He saw no redness and I was not tender to the touch: which is not surprising as I never had redness and was only ever tender during a full flare. My labs say uric acid is down to 4.9 (it was 7.6 before medication), there's no sign of inflammation except very slightly in the liver, and he took X-rays of both feet that came out normal. he suspects neuropathy, and is going to schedule a nerve conduction test. This week he put me on gabapentin and at first I had immediate results but on the whole I'm still having problems.\n\nNow it appears my gout is at least partially under control, but I have this nasty lingering pain. Diet doesn't seem to help anything. (I have noticed teriyaki steak is a trigger, but on allo it only triggered a mini flare, not a full one. Regular steaks didn't seem to have the same level of impact over the past year and change even without meds, but I've been mostly avoiding steak for months now.) Mainly what I notice is that if I sit with my feet down for an hour or more, as I do at my desk when I'm working, my feet and ankles feel \"thick\" and stiff and I tend to experience throbbing, burning, etc. Also walking around causes pain in my ankles, like that strain I mentioned (mostly when I pivot), and sometimes when planting my heel I have sharp pain in the ankle—front or back, it moves around.\n\nIs neuropathy really the answer? Do I have joint damage? Where do I go from here to get better fast?\n\n**What I've tried:** The few things I've noticed have *any* positive impact at all are celery seed extract, chugging water, and drinking chocolate milk (whole milk, no HFCS). The helpfulness of all of these is extremely limited.\n\nHere's what I'm taking for supplements, or have taken recently:\n\n* Magnesium: Helps with a bit of RLS that's gone along with this. (I believe I was very low when this started. During Attack Zero and Attack Prime I had low potassium because of the frelling thiazide that my rheumatologist thinks caused the gout, but my potassium is totally fine now.)\n* Turmeric with curcumin : Does absolutely nothing for inflammation.\n* Boswellia: I took this after the old meloxicam ran out, because it's supposed to work with the turmeric to reduce inflammation. About a week ago I stopped taking it; it did nothing and maybe it made things worse. *Something* made things worse.\n* Tart cherry extract: Does absolutely nothing.\n* Celery seed extract: Seems to help but only *very slightly*.\n* Uric acid cleanse mix (including tart cherry, celery seed, milk thistle, a bunch of other stuff); Hard to tell if it has any effect.\n* Quercetin & bromelain: Started a little over a week ago, hard to tell if it's doing anything.\n* Vitamin C (1000mg per day, sometimes 2000): Has no effect, but good for me anyway.\n* Vitamin D (5000 IU per day): Has no effect, but good for me anyway.\n* Multivitamin without iron: I stopped taking this about a week ago because I was concerned maybe I was getting too much B3, which I read can interfere with uric acid management. No change.\n* Alpha-lipoic acid (600 mg): Started taking this a week ago after the doctor visit, hoping to help with neuropathy. I saw immediate relief that same night, but I'm starting to wonder now if the small blood draw I had that day had more of an impact because as of Sunday I got worse again. I did change brands on Sunday after an Amazon order arrived, but changing back didn't seem to make a difference.\n* B12: I started this at the same time as the alpha-lipoic acid for the same reason. Switched to a different type and higher dosage but same brand (Solgar) on Sunday.\n\nBasically I've been furiously researching everything I can find from every gout website that's the least bit promising, looking up supplements I read about on Amazon to see what customers say, and playing supplement roulette.\n\nSo that's basically my history and where I'm at now. If any of you have had similar experiences with this type of lingering pain or have any advice that might help, I'm grateful for your input.",

It also helps me tolerate dairy better, which causes me obvious brain lag otherwise - essentially counteracting/rescueing its negative effect on me.\n\nI usually eat a little bit of green pepper with every meal (<100 grams per day, half-life time ~5 hours), together with fat/oil for better bioavailability.

It runs in the family, have had a few minor flares a few years apart in the past, but since late February have had 3 attacks which took me out.  Currently dealing with one that is 2+ weeks in and rheumatologist prescribed allo + colchicine for the first 2 months once this one subsides.  Didn’t do a pre-UA test but my 2 most recent levels were 9.3 and 7.2 on annual blood tests.  \n\nNow I know logically to “just cut the crap and do what the dr told me”, but tbh, I’m super afraid of starting Allopurinol.  It’s not really needing this lifelong (not a big meds person in general - my wife constantly calls out my stubbornness for refusing to take Tylenol in general), nor changes in the diet holding me back (I can drink less and have a few less burgers…..kind of looking forward to that hand being forced), but the chances of the super rare but super serious side effects.  Rheumo told me if I see a rash, stop and go to the ER.  That kind of worried me, and well, I went down the Google rabbit hole.  Despite the fact that I’m not in the target groups at higher genetic risk for those effects, and my dad has been using Allo for 20 years, it still frightens me.  \nThe colchicine is fine - I’ve taken that before and have dealt with the side effects. I know what I’m getting into there.  \n\nQuestions are: \n- Has anybody tried any of the Tart Cherry + Celery Seed Extract supplements or similar from Amazon, and do they actually do anything?  Yes, I know that genetics are still a part of it and natural supplements can only do so much.  But wondering if there’s a chance of a more natural remedy, I’d like to consider that.  \n- Anybody gone through the same mental state and what helped with that?  Fortunately, the ER super close to me and I have as supportive of a wife can be to monitor and help where needed every step of the way.  \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.  Been great finding this sub in the early stages of dealing with this.  ",

You will get the initial flare when you start like all of us but you’ll get some prednisone to go with it to take care of the pain. \n\nObviously your choice with what you want to put in your body but basically everyone on here will tell you to get on allo and get your life back. Good luck!",

(See Myles Power on YouTube for more info.)\n\nHowever, urinary pH is a different thing. Urine can vary in pH and making it more alkaline supposedly helps flush uric acid out quicker. The problem I've found is that there seem to be no reliable sources of information about what changes your urine pH and how; any source I've found is deeply tied to the aforementioned quackery.\n\nSo this stuff may be doing something for you, or it may not. If you're not testing your uric acid, you're only guessing. If it's doing anything at all, it would be because the calcium is binding to something in your body, but who knows what that could be.

I've had full on flare-ups once a year or every other year since then, with controllable twinges (using ibuprofen or Aleve) in between. Lately I've put on weight as I hit 31 - when I went in for a new flare-up last Thursday I weighed in at 275. Fuck that shit. \n\nMy father and brother have never had gout issues, but my grandfather has dealt with severe spells of rheumatoid arthritis (not specifically gout, AFAIK) since his 20s (now 88).\n\nSo first, I'm trying to kill this flare up so I can get back in the gym. I also want to cut out as much NSAID usage for those twinges as possible.\n\nUnrelated to gout, I've pretty much stopped drinking - hitting bars is less fun/necessary in a long-term relationship and all my friends are getting older and less bar-active as well. So beer and booze are no longer a factor.\n\nSoda is the first thing to go - in the last week I've had two or three Cokes, down from 2-3/day with meals. I already drink 2-3 liters of water/day and more when the gout kicks me in the ass. Starting tomorrow, absolutely zero. I'mma learn to love coffee and tea when I need flavor. \n\nDiet is getting cleaned up - probably some variation of paleo/primal/gluten-free. Greens and moderate protein/moderate fat. I've read Gary Taubes unpublished chapter on gout and the link between fructose (particularly HFCS) & metabolic syndrome and gout makes sense to me, given my history. I don't think in the long run I'll have to panic about meat intake/purines. \n\nHad my first real flare in a year starting last Wednesday. No insurance so I hit a doc in a box, got a steroid shot/etc.. Steroid shot knocked it down to uncomfortable, unless I poke the joint of my big toe directly. \n\nFor the last week I've been on indomethacin, it's been the same since the steroid shot got it relatively under control; went back today and the CareNow doc added probenecid. As I don't have insurance, he was worried colchicine would be too costly (no longer available generically?). Plan is to go on Allopurinol after this flare-up is controlled. \nIf things don't clear up by next Thursday I'm going to request colchicine regardless of price.\n\n\nIn the realm of home remedies.\nVitamin C at 2g (as calcium ascorbate) has no apparent effect. I haven't worked my way up to higher doses, fearing stomach revolt.\n\nBaking soda might help, but it makes me feel awful in general so I can't do it on the regular.\n\nApple cider vinegar, I'll toss back a shot glass full on occasion. Doesn't do enough for me to use it regularly. \n\nCherry juice and cherry extract appear to do nothing for me.\n\nJust bought a bottle of celery seed extract (100mg of extract @ 85% phthalides, 400mg celery). I'm also tempted to juice enough celery to make a glass of celery juice, but I don't know if I can choke it down.\n\nBasically, I'm not sold on any home remedies in the long term. I think drugs (Allopurinol, colchicine, possibly Uloric) are the best course of action if you can get to a doctor and tolerate any of them, followed by exerting control over body weight/fat and diet.

Here's my short take:\n\nAbout four years ago (around age 44) I had my first gout attack. It started a bit slowly and I thought I had a sore toe, so I rubbed and massaged it. I think that made it worse. It was the common experience of explosion, pain, etc. After a week or two, I went to urgent care and they tested my uric acid--said it was 7 and below the threshold so probably wasn't gout.\n\nI tried every remedy I read about: Cherry juice, cherries, apple cider vinegar, baking soda, celery seed extract pills, etc. A Vietnamese friend gave me some elixir made from green beans. Maybe the last one helped after a few days, I can't exactly recall. But the outbreak and problems with varying levels of pain was about a month.\n\nIn February this year, I experienced another outbreak on my other big toe. Again I tried several things and no real relief. Moved to the top of my foot and felt like I had tendon issues....but after a week or so, it had tell-tale signs of gout. Moved to the other foot and bottom....felt like a sore spot below my toes, like I wore the wrong shoes (maybe I did). Moved to one of my small middle toes. Anyway, in all it's been since February that I've had some foot issues to varying degrees of pain until this past week (April).\n\nWent back to trying cherry juice, cherries, apple cider vinegar, baking soda, celery seed extract pills, etc. No real relief for me. For years I've drank water constantly throughout the day--I drink tons each day, but it hasn't seemed to make a dent over the past couple months.\n\nThe only relief I really got was from prednizone. Doctor had prescribed it last year for a trip overseas in case I had a bad allergy issue, but I never used it. (I rarely had allergies but at the time I was leaving, I was in the middle of a bad episode.) I read that it could help and boy did it. Knocked out the swelling and pain, but only for a good day and I went through the pills over the course of a week. Got another prescription and needed it for a trip in order to be able to walk properly a couple weeks ago.\n\nSomething interesting: A few weeks ago I had some bad gas or constipation for days....painful stuff that was coming in waves and and second time in about two months. Never happens as I have an iron stomach, exercise regularly, but I'm thinking it's maybe a kidney stone. It hurt! Anyway, I go the route of a cleanse and use some laxatives magnesium citrate liquid. Turns out it was some gas/constipation because I found relief. It seemed at the time that I also had some relief from the gout....but not entirely certain.\n\nFast forward, about five days ago I took some potassium gluconate that I had in the house. I had been taking about 10mg of prednizone for several days to keep the gout at bay and was out, so I took a chance on the potassium that night--about five or eight pills, 3% RDA each. The next day, I had 90% relief. I had ordered some potassium citrate and magnesium citrate pills and the next night took all three pills....again, more of the potassium because of lower strength.\n\nIn the past four or five days, I've felt great. Still al little (4%?) soreness in feet but I think maybe for me there is some correlation. Maybe it's just coincidence but the potassium is cheap and worth a shot. I have even been drinking beer this weekend and no triggers (I think it has triggered be before.) I've kept taking the tablets daily.\n\nI had already scheduled a doctor's appointment for tomorrow to see about getting some of the regular medicine others take. I'm tired of not being able to go jogging and don't want to take a chance. But I wanted to share this experience.",

Hear me out: I've had problems in the past year or two with tendons on top of my left foot getting irritated from things like tying shoes too tight--I think from an earlier injury and they are just sensitive. The pain will last for days due to injuring. Well, I got new shoes, slip on loafers, wore them for first time on Monday and started irritating that area. I changed out at noon. However, the next morning the area was in a lot of pain like I re-injured that sensitive area... plus I got the bonus of a gout explosion in my big toe. \n\nWent to urgent care, got steroids and the doc even prescribed Allo (finally!) for me to start on in a  couple weeks when this has ended. Steroids have ended the gout pain and swelling, but I still feel some pain in those tendons. \n\nI plan to make an appointment with a rheumatologist.

It only happened when I really overworked myself, so I chalked it up as just that as it went away fairly quickly and never got worse. This time different; it started the same, but the feeling changed and has yet to go away. Visited the Dr. and she instantly said gout. We didn’t do blood test as I felt that she was confident in the diagnosis (and I’m not so keen on having a needle shoved into my joint at the time). I’m not really doubting it's gout, but I suppose I’m not entirely convinced either...\n\nWeek one I was on prednisone, swelling did not match that of those I have seen online; just my foot became puffy along with some redness and additional redness near joint area. Pain was relieving but still there. I could not bend my toes at all.\n\nWeek two I'm on; tart cherry extract, celery seed extract, turmeric, apple cider vinegar, bromelain, vitamin C. I could bend my toe by hand, downward only. Eventually I was able to flex on my own, but only barely and only downward without pain. Swelling up and down but always lower than week one.\n\nWeek three is same as two.\n\nDiet before has been absolutely terrible. Soda drinker, sugars, meats, etc. Tho I never ate organ foods or seafood. Not a drinker either, like almost ever.\nDiet since has been much better. No red meats, not a drop of sugar drinks. Maybe one cup of OJ, a carton of Pineapple juice and as much tart cherry juice I could handle; otherwise nothing but water. Lots and lots of greens too. If you just met me you'd think I’m some salad fanatic.\n\nI am obese and have horrific sleep apnea (which I treat successfully). Otherwise I am not on any medication or have any other influences that I'm away of other than what has already been stated.\n\nSo since end of week one I have seen zero improvement. Swelling and pain goes up and down a little bit. Some days I chill at my desk at work, others it's just a bit too much and I stay home.\n\nAny thoughts? Input? All comments welcome.\nTIA\n",

        "body": "Gout is indeed a tough pill to swallow. For most of us it means taking a good inventory of your lifestyle, and making changes. Sure, gout can be a genetic thing, but for most of us it's a wake up call; time to exercise, lose weight, eat healthy OR you know, heart disease, flare ups, maybe worse.\n\nAnyhow, there are no instant fixes; it took a long time for your body to get here, it's going to take time go get better. After my first flare up, I experienced a flare up every couple months for almost two solid years until I was finally able to identify my triggers and eliminate them from my diet. \n\nMy best advice is this:\n\nPeople on this subreddit are really quick to recommend allopurinol, and that's not always the best advice. Allopurinol is a daily lifetime medication that reduces the production of uric acid in your body, thus by taking it most people stop experiencing flare ups. The problem with that is for most of us that's treating the symptoms (gout) rather than treating the problem (obesity), so in a way, your doctor is going to use the threat of more flare ups to scare you into changing your lifestyle for the better - which is the route you want to go. You go on allopurinol because you're too stubborn to change your lifestyle, your doctor doesn't want to see you in this type of pain, of course he/she will put you on it to ease your suffering, but again, you're just opening the door for further health problems. \n\nWould I take allopurinol if my doctor recommended it? Absolutely. There are people who are physically fit and at a healthy weight that experience gout because of genetics, I certainly won't argue that. But again, for most of us, myself included, it's self-inflicted, and can be controlled by making the appropriate lifestyle changes. \n\nOtherwise stay off your feet, keep your foot elevated, drink a sh*t ton of water, and keep in contact with your doctor.",

Plan A is to first get your current flare up under control, for me that means going on a tapering dose of Prednisone, and staying off my feet as much as possible. The second part of Plan A is to get your diet & lifestyle under control:\n\n> There’s a very tight association between excess weight and the risk of developing gout and gout flares. It’s a dose-response relationship, meaning the more you weigh, the higher your risk, and the more likely you are to have recurrent attacks.\n\nSo the second part of Plan A is basically eating better in general, avoiding foods high in purines, and exercising which goes a long way towards minimising the risk of a flare up AND lowers your risk of said heard disease and cardiac events. It's a double-whammy, why would your doctor not want this for you? Well, the truth of the matter is some people are just too stubborn and cannot imagine a life where they cannot drink beer and eat whatever the hell they want; and your doctor does not want to see you suffer, so after a few flare ups with no end in site, your doctor will end your suffering and prescribe allopurinol for life, and just settle on some good old fashioned heart disease a little further down your likely shortened life. \n\nAfter all I've preached here, there's still this:\n\n> Lifestyle changes can also edge down uric acid levels, and should be seen as an additional treatment – but not a replacement – to medication.\n\nI've had success with lifestyle changes minimizing my flare ups; I've had gout for seven years, and it took me about two to figure out my triggers, and since then I've been flare up free for five years and counting. Even if I do hit my target weight, which I'm hoping to do this summer, I'm still going to stick to my gout friendly diet. I'm not going to go back to drinking beer, and I'm still going to avoid my triggers like the plague. That means minimal red meat, minimal fried foods, no turkey, and no alcohol for life. And to me that's not a big deal, for others, maybe it is. And that's fine, everyone gets to make their own choices.\n\nI'm giving lifestyle my best shot, and even then I feel allopurinol is possibly inevitable for me, I'd like to do everything I can to avoid it.

I had ONE worse one before because I was on allopurinol but this is basically the same, my ankle is a potato and my knee won’t budge. \n\nI have just started taking Uloric last week and colchicine 2 days ago. I’m currently also on healthy keto which usually involves chicken and veggies for me, nothing unfriendly to gout, but I’ve cut the chicken out too. I’ve added in turn though cherries three times a day, celery seed extract, lemon water, citrate bicarbonate and my usual 2+ litres of water a day. This started on Friday and is worsening every day. I’m actually bedridden. \n\nMy question is does this usually happen in the first bit of uloric? If so how long can I expect relief in with colchicine and uloric, curious if someone else was doing this with these particular medicines and keto. Could I be doing more (without steroids)? I’ve braved walking when my ankle felt like it was made of glass before but it’s impossible with the knee.",

The doctor at the time told me not to worry and gave me some Naproxen. This has worked reasonably well (attacks ranging from 2 days to 2 weeks), until this year...\n\nBack in early April I had a flare in my left big toe which didn’t want to go away. In early June I finally thought it was almost gone when it came back in the next joint up with a vengeance! \n\n14 days ago it finally went, leaving a small bump on the side of my foot, and in my intense happiness, I did something a bit stupid. I went on a weekend drinking mission with a few friends. Last Monday it came came back again. This time the big toe on my right foot basically turned into an angry, throbbing tomato.\n\nAt this point I thought I should get better informed, started doing some research and came across this amazing subreddit.  Suddenly, I wasn’t alone any more and have so far spent hours reading and learning. I immediately cut down on food and drink heavy in purines and went teetotal. On top of this I started taking celery seed extract, cherry capsules and magnesium supplements. This has helped somewhat but I started to fear another few months of pain.\n\nFor the last 3 months I’ve been struggling to get a doctors appointment due to COVID but I got up at 7am this morning and sat on the phone to my local GP surgery until I finally got through. After a chat with the doctor, he prescribed me some Colchicine and has booked me for a blood test in 3 weeks time with a view to starting on Allopurinol. Hooray!\n\nI’ve taken the suggested 2 tablets and then another one an hour later and I’m currently sat waiting to see if my backside is going to explode and force me to redecorate the bathroom, but so far so good. Although my guts are making some strange sounds?!\n\nI’m a little concerned that with the diet changes and supplements, my UA levels will be fine when I get the blood test and they won’t get me taking Allo. I guess I’ll cross that bridge when I come to it and be prepared to give up a few luxuries for the sake of a pain free existence.\n\nAnyway, thank you so much to all of you fellow sufferers that have taken the time to post on here and help others out with this crippling disease. It really is a fantastic resource and one I’m now proud to be part of.",

    "body": "So this may be a bit long and i apologize for that. But i've had gout for a couple of years and get a flare up maybe twice a year. Each time it is pretty horrendous amounts of pain in my big toe. Whats interesting is that it alternates between the left or right foot, and luckily i haven't had both at the same time...yet.\n\nSo as far as dietary stuff goes. I DO NOT drink ANY alcohol. I am coming up on 5 years sober from narcotics. And even back then i never really drank. I am pretty over weight. Male, 24, 6 foot even, about 320 lbs. But i know to avoid spinach and kale and try to avoid these foods at all costs. I do rather enjoy sushi. Which just from a moment spent here sounds like a big no no? I also am fairly fond of meat and could definitely stand to include more fruits and veggies in my diet. I also try very hard to not drink soda or energy drinks. And while its rare that i do so, every now and then i slip up.\n\nWhat i have been doing since my attack started is as follows.\nWake up in the morning and immediately take an allopurinol tablet. Mine says 1 a day only. \nThen immediately go get a trenta of black iced coffee (30ozs black coffee no ice) this is my morning coffee and has been for years. I usually get vanilla for flavor but not when i am having a flare up.\nThen after drinking my coffee i'll drink a bit more water to help flush my system.\nThen i'll do an epsom salt and apple cider vinegar foot bath in hot water. This helps most noticeably relieve pain for me.\nThen i'll take 3 celery seed extract pills which act as a diuretic and continue to drink a lot of water.\n(Seriously at this point i'm peeing like every 20 minutes)\nThen a bit later i'll do 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and 3 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar with a packet of emergen-C in a water cup. I've heard the baking soda helps your PH balance and helps your kidneys flush the uric acid. The apple cider vinegar does something similar. And vitamin c is supposed to help flush too.\n\nI also have indomethicin, but i feel absolutely no pain relief from them, and can only take 2 a day with food. And i'm pretty much scared of eating anything while having an attack.\n\nSo i've come here in an effort to find out what works for you? I'm honestly considering chopping off my feet at this point and can barely sleep with the pain.",

I've been in the midst of what I am assuming is a Gout attack for what seems like forever. The major pain lasted for a week or so and then it started to taper off, but I still had a lot of pain in my foot. I could walk short distances and whatnot but I seemed to be getting stronger.\n\nFor a little bit of background, prior to this attack, my diet was HORRIBLE. I drank diet soda constantly, wasn't eating well or balanced, wasn't eating many times a day. I know fasting, de-hydration (diet soda culprit?), and Fast Food can all be triggers. One night I simply had a horrible feeling in my ankle and knee and I was down and on crutches for a while. It totally changed my perceptions. I kicked the drinks, and have been pounding nothing but water (I'm so glad I did too, I don't feel like I need that addiction anymore).\n\nNow to get the question. I've been doing a lot to try and kick this attack. I haven't been able to see a doctor yet (and I'm curious about allopurinol) but I also know that's not going to do anything actively to stop this attack from happening. I've been pounding nothing but water, eating only Low Fat Cherry Yogurt and Grilled Cheese with the occasional nuts. This has been going on for almost a month. I also have some tart cherry extract and celery seed extract I've been using.\n\nToday, I woke up and all of the pain in my foot is almost completely gone but now the back of my knee is in disarray. I can still walk, but it hurts quite a bit, and I am kind of panicking because I am worried it's going to progress to the point I can't walk again. I know a lot of people said that it can take a while for Uric Acid to leave your system. Is it possible that the acid build-up left my foot and is now in my knee because it is trying to travel up to the bladder to leave my system? It seems logical to me but because I am still very new to all this, I would love some feedback from anyone else that has experienced that.\n\nReally sorry for the excessively long post. Hope everyone else is doing okay out there.",

You could exercise, drink water, eat healthy and etc, but you still may get triggers from all of the above, its just that its better for you if you do those things. In most cases, your kidneys are not ridding of the excess acid in your body, hence the buildup of crystals. And some people suggest that the home remedies help, and I don’t disagree, it is safe to say you will need to get on Allopurinol to help control your UA levels. As far as your gout movements, everyone’s body is different, but for the most part, it seems that flare ups usually just sit in one spot and then move on you. Flare ups can last a couple of days to couple of weeks, but just because it moves from your toe to your ankle to your knee to your elbow, it still means the same thing, you have UA in your body and its sitting in your joints. Get some ibuprofen and get on a tele doc or family doctor to get bloodwork done and get on meds to help your active life.

Here's what im doing,\nfirstly I've cut out all read meat and beer from my diet. im taking tart cherry extract and celery seed extract pills twice a day. eating at least 3 bananas a day (even though i dont like them). drinking shitloads of water id say up to 3-4 litres per day. drinking  a nip of apple cider vinegar each day and also drinking rooibos tea. \nanyone else gone to these extreme or am i going too far? \nalso should i resume the allipurnol now that the gout attack has subsided?\n\n",

Caffeine is a purine but drinking coffee protects from a gout attack going by recent studies.\n\nUric acid is made as purines are metabolised, high uric acid levels correlate with gout attack but allopurinol drops the uric acid levels and often precipitates an attack.\n\nTo me the story is far from clear and the fact people suffer from many different triggers suggest to me it's not as simple as purine = gout attack.  Companies like AstraZeneca are busy working on combination drugs to help allopurinol work, but that just generates repeat revenue not cures.\n\nI have no problems eating keto, life is worse with alcohol (but thats the body prioritisation).

Individual metabolism, high tolerance with a strong demand for NO production or efficiently absorbed and processed amino acids without excess waste production\n\n2. Enzyme efficiency, enzyme pathways are well developed or functioning at a higher efficiency allowing better utilization without causing GI distress\n\n3. Adaptive responses, regular use of NO supplements may lead the body to adapt, improving both absorption and tolerance. Intense exercise concurrently may attribute to this. ",

According to the World Health Organization, over **1.28 billion adults** globally have hypertension—and many don’t even know it.\n\nWhile medications can be effective, they can also come with side effects such as dizziness, fatigue, and even sexual dysfunction. This has led many people to explore **natural supplements** to help manage and maintain healthy blood pressure levels.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll take a deep dive into **natural supplements** that have shown promise in supporting cardiovascular health and specifically reducing high blood pressure. We’ll also look at lifestyle integrations, precautions, and combinations that may help you take control of your blood pressure naturally.\n\n# Understanding Blood Pressure and Its Root Causes\n\nBefore jumping into the supplements, it's important to understand what causes high blood pressure in the first place. Some of the most common contributing factors include:\n\n* High sodium intake\n* Low potassium intake\n* Chronic stress\n* Sedentary lifestyle\n* Poor diet (rich in processed foods, sugars, and unhealthy fats)\n* Excessive alcohol intake\n* Smoking\n* Obesity\n* Genetic predisposition\n\nNow that we know the culprits, let’s talk about **natural allies** in the fight against hypertension.\n\n# 1. Magnesium: The Mighty Mineral\n\nMagnesium plays a crucial role in over **300 enzymatic processes**, including muscle function and cardiovascular regulation. It helps blood vessels **relax**, which can reduce pressure against arterial walls.\n\n# Benefits:\n\n* Lowers both **systolic and diastolic** blood pressure\n* Enhances insulin sensitivity (which can indirectly affect BP)\n* Reduces vascular resistance\n\n# Sources:\n\n* Magnesium glycinate, citrate, or taurate are well-absorbed forms\n* Dosage: 200–400 mg/day (consult with a physician for precise recommendations)\n\n# 2. Potassium: The Sodium Counterbalance\n\nPotassium is essential for maintaining the proper **electrolyte balance** and helps the body eliminate sodium through urine. It also eases tension in blood vessel walls.\n\n# Benefits:\n\n* Counteracts the negative effects of sodium\n* Improves cardiovascular function\n* Associated with reduced risk of stroke\n\n# Sources:\n\n* Potassium citrate or gluconate in supplement form\n* Natural food sources like bananas, sweet potatoes, spinach, and avocados\n* Recommended intake: 2,500–3,000 mg/day from food and/or supplements\n\n**Caution**: Those with kidney issues should not take potassium without medical supervision.\n\n# 3. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): The Energy Antioxidant\n\nCoQ10 is a fat-soluble antioxidant present in every cell of the body, particularly in the heart.

Here are a few key habits to adopt:\n\n1. **Reduce sodium intake** – Stay under 2,300 mg/day.\n2. **Increase potassium-rich foods** – Like leafy greens, bananas, and avocados.\n3. **Exercise regularly** – Even 30 minutes of brisk walking helps.\n4. **Manage stress** – Through meditation, yoga, prayer, or breathwork.\n5. **Avoid smoking and excess alcohol** – These spike your BP significantly.\n6. **Get good sleep** – Aim for 7–8 hours/night for hormone balance and recovery.\n\n# What to Watch Out For\n\nEven though these supplements are natural, **natural doesn’t mean risk-free**. Here are a few caveats:\n\n* **Drug interactions**: Always consult your physician if you're taking medication.\n* **Kidney health**: Be careful with potassium or magnesium if you have kidney disease.\n* **Allergies or sensitivities**: Check for ingredients like soy, dairy, or gluten in supplement fillers.\n* **Over-supplementation**: More isn't always better—especially with fat-soluble vitamins.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nHigh blood pressure is a serious health concern, but it can often be managed—and even reversed—through a holistic, natural approach. Supplements can play a powerful role in **supporting cardiovascular health**, especially when paired with intentional lifestyle changes.\n\nEveryone’s body is different, so the journey toward better health will vary from person to person. However, by incorporating scientifically backed natural supplements like **magnesium**, **CoQ10**, **omega-3s**, **garlic**, and others mentioned above, you can give your heart the tools it needs to thrive.\n\nRemember: **You are your best health advocate.** Take control. Track your progress. And consult with a knowledgeable healthcare provider who supports integrative, functional wellness.\n\nBecause your heart deserves it.\n\n[**Lateef Warnick**](https://www.onassiskrown.com/pages/lateef-warnick) is the founder of [**Onassis Krown**](https://www.onassiskrown.com/).

    "body": "Hi all! \n\nMe: 31/M/200lbs/6ft\n\nLong story short, I'm in the middle of my 4th gout flare up ever. It's also been the most painful, most immobilizing, and longest lasting. I was recently in Mexico for a beach wedding, I over indulged (beer and ritas galore) and am now seriously paying for it. This is a turning point in my life, as I'm going to try and completely cut out booze, and severely change my diet. \n\nThe initial pain started on Saturday night, and has progressively gotten worse up to this afternoon (Tuesday 05/03). My wife stopped by the store on her way home from work, as I'm couch ridden and lucky to be able to work from home, and she picked up the following natural remedies after reading some good info on them. \n\nCould my fellow gout suffering redditors let me know if you've had success with these or not, or am I too late into the attack to have any relief with them? \n\n1. [Gouch](http://www.amazon.com/Redd-Remedies-Gouch-Antioxidants-Vegetarian/dp/B006YJBQ72) \n2. Celery Seed extract (pill)\n3. Stinging Nettle Root (pill)\n\nI've been overloading on water and NSAIDs so far, but my foot (more specifically big toe) is still swollen and red, throbbing with pain for almost 36 hours now. \n\nThanks in advance!\n\nP.S. I tried to make a Dr. appt with a Rheumatologist, but they required a referral from my primary doc and can't get squeezed in until Friday or next week to see my general practitioner. I have another wedding this weekend, and would like to show up without a cane! ",

It started in the heel of my foot and moved around toward my ankle and then the next thing I know my entire foot is swollen up twice the size of my other one, it is red hot to touch And feels like it’s on fire all the time, not to mention pain when I try to walk. I have a boot from when I fractured my ankle that seems to help me be able to get around and do things while I’m in recovery.\n\nI don’t know about anybody else, but I have trouble taking medication and so I’ve been searching for natural remedies for gout, and I have had success with organic tart cherry And celery seed extract plus drinking lots of water and staying away from foods that tend to aggravate gout. I never would’ve dreamed it hurts as much as a broken bone. I’ve broken 10 bones over the last several years and I do have osteoporosis. I’m also trying to overcome that. So I keep running into foods that I need to help rebuild my bones, causing gout. Anybody else in a similar situation? Anybody else have some good suggestions? I’m open to hearing them.",

Anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids are the strongest tool to stop the flare pain today, and allopurinol (or similar drugs) to reduce your uric acid levels so you don't get more flares.  Then with time you can heal.  Food is important, but it doesn't seem to be nearly as effective as the two drug protocols I mentioned.  But talk to your Dr, Reddit can't be the best place to get medical advice, just a consensus.",

I do take alcohol (beer + wine) regularly but don't have any weight issues. \n\nMeds:\nLamotrigine\n\nDaily Supplements I intend to keep in rotation (ranked from most important to least based on my opinion):\n\n* Vitamin D, 2000 iu\n* Omega-3 2,400mg\n* Vit B6 and B12, 1 capsule normal strength\n* Alpha Lipoic acid 600mg\n* Palmitoyl ethanolamide (PEA)\n* Broccoli sprouts (home grown)\n* Yogurt with probiotics\n* Bromelain 500mg \n* Celery seed extract (3-n-butyl-phtalide)\n \n\nOnce in a while/might drop:\n\n* Magnesium\n* Zinc\n* Resveratrol\n* Quercetin \n\nRight now, I take everything except PEA and Lamotrigine in the morning with breakfast but I'm wondering if there would be a better timing or order to take them.

One study that surveyed people with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection found that 30% of them still had persistent symptoms after 9 months. Fatigue, brain fog and memory issues were among the list of common persistent symptoms. Obviously not everyone who gets SARS-CoV-2 also has it confirmed, so the numbers may be lower for pooled confirmed and unconfirmed infections. But even if you make very optimistic estimates, SARS-CoV-2 is a significant risk to your cognitive health. Vaccines are known to somewhat decrease your chances of getting infected, but they are very good at decreasing the severity of the damage done to your body when you do get an infection.\n\nIt's possible that the best thing you can do for your brain this year is to get vaccinated for covid-19.\n\nIf you are afraid of getting vaccinated more than you are afraid of getting a SARS-CoV-2 infection, please read through this [Vaccines FAQ](https://www.idsociety.org/covid-19-real-time-learning-network/vaccines/vaccines-information--faq/).

I had my levels remeasured this week and my uric acid is now at 8.0 mg/dL. In my opinion, this is a significant improvement from supplements on their own. I would like to hear any thoughts or suggestions. \n\nBeing that I’m only 22, I prefer avoiding long-term medications like Allopurinol. I will remeasure my levels in another 3 months and provide an update at that time. \n\nIn addition to supplements, I have completely cut my refined carbohydrate and sugar intake. I believe that the byproducts from sugar/high fructose corn syrup and refined carbohydrates causes more uric acid production than that of animal meat. Sugar and refined carbs also cause dehydration, which in turn, promotes the buildup of uric acid. Over the past 2 years, my poor diet has consisted of an incomprehensible amount of sugar and refined carbs because of fast food consumption, (often multiple times per day). I have insulin resistance, (high insulin promotes more uric acid production), low vitamin D, and a vitamin B deficiency. \n\nWith a very strict diet and the continuation of these supplements, I am hopeful that I can lower my uric acid to normal levels. Additionally, I was instructed by a urologist/kidney surgeon to consume large amounts of alkaline water as a simple solution to my uric acid problem. I will test his theory over the next few months.",

But my research and reading led me to believe that 1 point is usually all you will move it without Allo.  \n\nI just had my levels checked after being on Allo for 6 weeks.   I went from 6.9 to 5.5.  I gave up drinking ( I didn’t drink much anyway). Stopped all high fructose corn syrup, fast food, improved my diet, and drank a ton of water.   I will double the dose of Allo and then test again in 6 weeks.  My goal is below 4. \n\nGood luck!  But don’t wait too long and suffer when the Allo can provide lasting relief!",

None of us, even those of us twice your age, are excited that we have to take a daily pill.\n\nBut here's the thing. Going from 9.1 to 8.0 **isn't** a significant improvement unless it continues rapidly and ends up somewhere well below 6.0. That's the magic number where monosodium urate will no longer crystallize in your joints and tissues, and existing deposits will begin to dissolve away.\n\nI'm glad you are eating better and addressing your vitamin deficiencies, and if these changes get you where you need to be, that's super! But I need to warn you that the numbers aren't on your side. Most who try this route fail. And once you have gout, then the longer your UA stays above 6.0 mg/dL, the more you risk potentially permanent joint damage.",

I think naturally, we are on the right track  I did find:\n\n**AI Overview**  Both celery seed and celery stalk may help lower blood pressure, but celery seed extract may be more effective:  \n\n* **Celery seed extract**Animal studies suggest that celery seed extracts may help lower blood pressure and cholesterol. Celery seed extract may also have a bradycardia effect. In one study, 1.34 grams of celery seed extract reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 11 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 8 mmHg.  \n* **Celery stalk**  Celery stalks contain fiber, magnesium, and potassium, which can help regulate blood pressure. Celery is also low in calories and sodium, and contains vitamins A, C, and K, as well as calcium and iron. To get the blood pressure-regulating benefits of celery stalk, you should eat about four stalks per day.  \n\nCelery's bioactive compounds, such as 3-n-butylphthalide and apigenin, may be responsible for its blood pressure-regulating effects. Celery may also work by blocking calcium channels, acting as a diuretic, and relaxing blood vessels.  Other seeds that may help lower blood pressure include pumpkin, flax, and sunflower seeds.  \n\nAdministration of 250 mg of celery stem extract reduced 9.59 mmHg in SBP and 15.2 mmHg in DBP \\[23\\]. Also, **intervention with 1.34 g of celery seed extract showed a reduction of 11 mmHg in SBP and 8 mmHg in DBP** \\[22\\].

I was craving chicken noodle soup to help my morning sickness today, and I ate nearly an entire large-size soup from Wawa before I thought to look up the ingredients and discovered that it contains celery seed extract!! Dr. Google says this can cause uterine contractions and I’m feeling worried! Is this something I need to be concerned about? Thanks everyone!",

Other than the list your OB will provide, you’d have to eat a specific ingredient in enormous quantities to have any chance of affecting your baby. The amount of the extract used in a soup is likely vanishingly small, even if this was some wild and crazy extract that was actually a cause for concern.",

Second pregnancy now and I do not google anything… I follow doctors rules now so no drinking, smoking, wash your vegetables. I still eat those runny eggs, medium steaks sushi etc.. I’m MUCH happier this round baby is perfectly healthy I’m 30 weeks. \n\nYou’re in for a long road if you go down this route of looking at every little thing and googling. I did this with my first pregnancy and had a terrible time, my mental health suffered greatly. \n\nEnjoy your soup, don’t think twice.",

Taking celery seed extract *as a supplement* may well be a bad idea (I have no idea).  But the amount of celery seed extract used as a food flavoring isn't an issue.  Supplements contain much, much more of a substance than is used in food.",
