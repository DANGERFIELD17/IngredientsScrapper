    "body": "I've met alot of women in my life who were unaware about various things about the female body, myself included. As a teenager, there were alot of things I've learned that I thought was true, only to realize it isn't.\nI wanted to make a post to share things I've learned over the years, and debunk myths.\nThis is mostly aimed at teenage girls/young women. But who knows! Maybe you learn something new aswell, even if you don't fit that category.\n\nIf you have anything you want to add, feel free to do so in the comments!\n\n\n**PEE AFTER SEX**\nPeeing after sex can help to flush bacteria out of the urethra, and therefore help avoiding an UTI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Sex shouldn't hurt your first time**\nPeople make having sex with men as a woman for the first time sound like a complete horror story.\nBut I'm happy to say, it's not!\nIt's normal to feel a little sore afterwards, but it's not supposed to be painful.\nDon't rush it, have fun with eachother. Make out, touch eachother, etc. \nIf it's difficult to insert the penis or if it's painful, leave it be, and do some more foreplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Your vagina is self-cleaning**\nVaginas are self cleaning. You never need to clean the inside of your vagina with water, soap or any other feminine hygiene products. \nThe vulva can be cleaned with a gentle unscented soap if this doesn't irritate you, but can contribute to recurrent yeast infections or Bacterial Vaginosis for some people.\nUsing water alone to clean your vulva is what is recommended by medical professionals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Having stains on your clean underwear is normal**\nThe vagina has a acidic pH level, that's why discharge can leave stains on your underwear. It's completely normal, and that doesn't mean your underwear isn't clean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Semen can mess up your vaginas pH-level**\nThe optimal vaginal pH level is between 3.8 and 4.5, which makes it acidic. \nSemen and soap have an alkaline pH, in the 7-9 range.\nBecause of this, the presence of semen can elevate your vaginal pH long after sex.\nIf you often have problems with UTIs after having sex, this may be the reason why.\nThe best way to deal with this is using a condom.\n\nEDIT:\nLubed condoms can actually mess with your pH levels aswell.\nMany popular brands of lube/condoms can irritate the vagina due to it's pH level.\n\n- If a product is CE marked, it’s a confirmation that it’s safe for the bodily environment it was intended for, by European Economic Area (EEA) standards. Without this, there’s no confirmation that your lube product doesn’t contain anything that’s harmful to your vulva skin and vaginal pH.\n- Avoid lubes/condoms that have flavors/fragrances such as fruity, floral, candy, etc.\n- Avoid: Glycerin(e), Propylene Glycol, Nonoxynol 9, Chlorhexedine Gluconate, Petroleum Oils, Polyquaternium-15, Benzocaine, Sugars & Sugar Alcohols, Ureas.\n\nThank you u/DiabloStorm for informing me about this!\nHere's a guide about everything to do with lube, I highly recommed it: http://dangerouslilly.com/lube-guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**80% of women don't orgasm from penetrative sex**\nCan't seem to reach an orgasm during penetrative sex? You're definitely not alone!\nThe vast majority of women are only able to orgasm from clitorial stimulation, the clit is the only thing on the human body that exists for pleasure only, after all, experiment with it!\nDon't accept that sex is done when he reaches an orgasm, when he didn't even try to pleasure you aswell.\nYour pleasure is just as important as theirs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Most women don't bleed their first time**\nIn some cultures, a husbands family demands to see bloody sheets after the wedding night, to prove that the bride was a virgin. This is false.\nOnly 1 in 5 women bleed their first time, I didn't bleed the first time I had sex.\nBleeding or not doesn't prove if the women has or hasn't had sex before.\nQuick note: If you're a woman who needs to prove her \"virginity\" by showing bloody sheets on her wedding night, and you're worried that you won't bleed, please DM me. There are multiple ways you can fake bleed, I can help you. Surgery is the worst thing you can do, there are different options that are much better!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Nobody can look inside your vagina and determine if you've had sex or not**\nThere have been cases of people taking their girlfriends/daughters/wives to a gynecologist to see if they have stretched their hymen or not.\nLike the rapper T.I, who took his 18 year old daughter to a gynecologist to get answers.\nThe truth is that no doctor or gynecologist can examine you to see if you've had sex or not, that's something only you know.\nThe hymen can stretch from doing everyday things, running, sports, riding a bike, etc. It has nothing to do with proving if you've had sex or not, it's just impossible to prove that. Some women are born without a hymen.\nPlease don't be discouraged to do sports and other things to avoid streatching your hymen.\nThere's help out there for women who need to prove their \"virginity\" to their boyfriend/father/husband this way. No person should ever do that to you. Please DM me if you're in that situation, I will more than gladly help you.\nVirginity is a made up concept to make people feel ashamed about their sexual experiences or lack there of. Again,  nobody can determine if you've had sex or not.\n\nEDIT:\nThank you u/Chickiri for posting this great and informative comment:\n\n\"While it's not possible to tell wether you're a virgin or not based on the state of your hymen alone, there are ways to detect wether or not you've had sex, which are especially important in the case of rape. If you've been raped/fear you've been raped (if you feel like maybe you've been drugged/intoxicated/any other situation), please seek a professional: this is very important for your health, and for any legal action you might want to take.\"\n\nThis is very important, it's completely understandable if you're afraid to report it. But please go to the hospital first thing, don't shower or change clothes. They will help tremendously, and they won't force you to report if you don't want to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Having large labia minora is normal**\nLabiaplasty is getting more and more popular amongst young women, because they feel like their vulva is \"abnormal\".\nIt isn't, every single vulva is normal. There is not a \"right\" way for a vulva to look. \nThere's a woman and activist called mediclit on twitter, she got a labiaplasty at 18. The procedure left her mutilated, and she no longer have any feeling in her clitoris. If you're interested in this topic, I suggest checking her out.\nPlease be safe!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**It's totally normal for one boob to be bigger than the other**\nIt's way more common to have asymmetrical boobs than have symmetrical ones. It's actually very rare to have perfectly symmetrical boobs, don't worry about it!\nThat being said, if you suddenly develop asymmetry, like a sudden increase or decrase in volume of the boobs, you should get that checked out. That’s especially true if that change comes with other symptoms like skin retraction, or thickening, dimpling, or a change in color of your breast. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**You can get pregnant during your period**\nIt's very unlikely, but it's not impossible.\nOnce inside a woman, sperm can wait for an egg for up to a week. Ovulation can occur soon after, or even during, the bleeding phase of a woman's menstrual cycle, giving the sperm the chance to get lucky. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**The vagina does not become \"loose\" if you have alot of sex**\nEver wondered why men say a woman who've slept with a 100 men have a \"loose\" vagina, but a woman who slept with the same man a 100 times doesn't? Me too!\nThis is simply a slut-shaming tactic, it isn't true. \nVirginity is a social construct, and who many people you've sex with is nobodys business, and it doesn't determine your worth.\nThe vagina can push out an entire baby and go back to its normal size, a dick won't change shit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Birthcontrol isn't only for avoiding pregnancy**\nI had very painful periods as a teenager, had all horrible sideeffects you could think of.\nMy mom suggested that I tried birthcontrol. Her suggestion made me feel embarrassed, I associated birthcontrol with having sex, and I hadn't had sex before at that age.\nShe explained that you can go on birthcontrol even if you aren't sexually active, and she's absolutely right.\nThere's many reasons why a woman would choose to go on birthcontrol, preventing pregnancy is only one of many.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Penetrative sex isn't the only way to have sex**\nThis annoys me alot. As a bisexual woman, I've been asked numerous times how two women have sex. They never ask how two men have sex, why? Because a dick is involved.\nThis is especially irritating considering that only 20% of women are able to orgasm that way.\nTo clarify, sex isn't just being able to orgasm either. But it annoys me that many men totally ignore the part that makes women reach climax, and won't even consider it sex.\nSex is so much more than just penetration, have fun with it, explore.\n\n\n\n\n**Vaginal discharge 101**\nI used Mama Doctor Jones video about discharge to provide pictures to better show what I mean. Thank your everybody who suggested her channel in the comments, very informative, and I highly recommend checking her out, you can find her video [here] (https://youtu.be/KHF8mB_8LUM)\n\nDischarge is a completely normal bodily function that cleans and protects the vagina.\nYour vaginal discharge can vary depending on your cycle, and it can vary from person to person.\nSome of us have alot, some of us have less, it's completely normal.\nI do not recommend wearing pantyliners on a daily basis to prevent getting discharge on your underwear, it can irritate the skin of the vulva. \n\n**Healthy/Normal discharge**\nThe color of vaginal discharge more commenly white or off-white, but sometimes it can have a bit of a yellow hue, and sometimes it can have a more transparent look.\n[Here] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHfQyZ.jpg) are some examples of normal consistencies and colors of discharge.\n\n*In the absence of any other symptoms*, these consistencies are completely normal:\n\n- Watery/Clear\n\n- Gel-like \"stringy\" discharge, normally happends before ovulation.\n\n- Also consistencies that I included in the photo.\n\nYour discharge may be a brownish color, this is also normal, reference photo [here] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHDEfo.jpg)\nThis is called spotting.\nSpotting is defined as light vaginal bleeding that happens outside of your regular periods.\nThis kind of brown discharge can often happend at the end of your cycle. It's old blood mixed with discharge, which creates a brown-like color.\n\n**Abnormal discharge**\nFirst of all, it's important to recognise how your discharge usually smell like. It shouldn't smell foul, but it's normal to have a smell or lack of it. If it does have a funny smell, it's a sign that you should get it checked up.\n\nCottage cheese-like chunks in your vaginal discharge, looks like [this] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHlZIV.jpg)\n\nThis can often signify a yeast infection.\nEspecially if it's followed by any of these symptoms:\n\n- Genital Itching \n\n- Swelling\n\n- Redness \n\n- Burning sensation while peeing or having penetrative sex\n\n- Your discharge might smell a little \"off\" if you have a yeast infection, but it can also have no odor at all.\n\n\nTREATMENT:\nIf it's your first time having an yeast infection, or if you're unsure if it is an yeast infection or not, make an appointment to your doctor.\n\nOtherwise, you can buy a over-the-counter yeast treatment. (Not recommended for pregnant women, book an appointment)\nIf your symptoms persists, book an appointment.\n\nDon't be embarrassed if you have a yeast infection, it's very common but unpleasant. Don't be afraid to seek treatment.\n\nTo reduce your risk of vaginal yeast infections: \n\n- Wear underwear that has a cotton crotch and doesn't fit too tightly.\n\nAvoid:\n\n- Tight-fitting pantyhose\n\n- Douching, which removes some of the normal bacteria in the vagina that protect you from infection\n\n- Scented feminine products, including bubble bath, pads and tampons\n\nThe following may increase your likelihood of yeast infections:\n- Stress\n\n- Diabetes\n\n- Use of birth control pills\n\n- Pregnancy\n\n- Antibiotics, especially prolonged use over 10 days\n\n\n\n\nAlot of yellow discharge that looks like [this] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHs8JF.jpg) especially if you have other symptoms could indicate chlamydia.\nA slight yellow hue can be normal in certain situations. But if you feel other symptoms, or if you recently had sex with a new person, you should get that checked out.\nRemember! Some people don't have any symptoms when they have chlamydia. Untreated chlamydia can result in serious health complications, such as pelvic inflammatory disease.\nThat's why it's very important to use a condom when having sex, and get tested if you have any doubts.\n\nIf you suspect that you have any kind of STI or STDs, seek medical treatment.\n\nLime green discharge, that kinda looks like mucus in my opinion, reference [here]\n(https://pasteboard.co/JZHvzad.jpg)\nAnd [here] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHvNlq.jpg)\nIf you have a new sexpartner or in any situation where you can be at risk for STI or STDs, this can indicate gonorrhea or trichomoniasis.\n\nSymptoms of trichomoniasis:\n- Itching, burning, redness or soreness of the genitals\n\n-Discomfort with urination\n\n-A change in their vaginal discharge (i.e., thin discharge or increased volume) that can be clear, white, yellowish, or greenish with an unusual fishy smell\n\nSymptoms of gonorrhea:\n- an unusual vaginal discharge, which may be thin or watery and green or yellow in colour\n\n- Pain or a burning sensation when peeing\n\n- Pain or tenderness in the lower abdominal area  (this is less common)\n\n- Bleeding between periods, heavier periods and bleeding after sex (this is less common)\n\nIf you suspect that you have any kind of STI or STD, seek medical attention.\n\nIf your discharge have a thin, gray color, it can indicate bacterial vaginosis. Couldn't find a good reference photo for this one, sorry about that.\n\nWhat is bacterial vaginosis?\nBacterial vaginosis is a type of vaginal inflammation caused by the overgrowth of bacteria naturally found in the vagina, which upsets the natural balance.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Grey-like discharge\n\n-Discharge have a strong fishy odor\n\n- Burning feeling when you pee\n\n- Itching\n\n50% of women do not have any symptoms.\n\nWhen to see a doctor:\n\n-You have vaginal discharge that's new and associated with an odor or fever. Your doctor can help determine the cause and identify signs and symptoms.\n\n- You've had vaginal infections before, but the color and consistency of your discharge seems different this time.\n\n- You have multiple sex partners or a recent new partner. Sometimes, the signs and symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection are similar to those of bacterial vaginosis.\n\n- You try self-treatment for a yeast infection with an over-the-counter treatment and your symptoms persist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS)**\nTSS is a rare but life-threatening condition caused by bacteria getting into the body and releasing harmful toxins.\nThis can affect both men, women and children.\nRisk factors for toxic shock syndrome include skin wounds, surgery, and the use of tampons.\nHaving your tampons in for longer than 8-12 hours can increase the risk of an infection or TSS.\n\nSymptoms:\nThe symptoms of toxic shock syndrome start suddenly and get worse quickly. They include:\n\n- A high temperature\n\n- Flu-like symptoms, such as a headache, feeling cold, feeling tired or exhausted, an aching body, a sore throat and a cough\n\n- Feeling and being sick\n\n- Diarrhoea\n\n- A widespread sunburn-like rash\n\n- Lips, tongue and the whites of the eyes turning a bright red\n\n- Dizziness or fainting\n\n- Difficulty breathing\n\n- Confusion\n\nTSS is very rare, but these symptoms should absolutely not be ignored, if you experience these symptoms, contact medical emergencies immediately. If you're using a tampon while experiencing these symptoms, remove it straight away. Inform medical staff if have used a tampon while experiencing these symptoms.\n\n\n\nLike I said, feel free to add anything if I forgot about something.\n\nI hope you all have an amazing day!\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nThank you so much for the awards and positive comments. \nYour comments warms my heart, I'm so glad that many of you have found it helpful.\n\nSeeing that many parents show their daughters and sons my post makes me so incredibly proud of myself, you have no idea how much it means to me.\n\n\nI'm happy that many women and girls are comfortable  enough to DM me with questions about their body, questions that they're afraid to ask in real life.\nI'm very happy to answer questions to the best of my ability, but please remember that I'm not a medical professional.",

You need to menstruate regularly to get rid of built up endometrial lining, if not you can develop endometrial cancer. This happened to me and I had to get a hysterectomy at a relatively young age (not even 40 yet). I was pissed that no one told me this was even a possibility. I had told doctors about my irregular period (which had NEVER been regular) and their response was \"Well we can put you on birth control to make you regular, but if it's not super heavy and the irregularity doesn't bother you, it's fine.\" It wasn't until I started having incredibly heavy periods (I was legit considering getting adult diapers) that I got treated. And by then it was too late. This could have been treated with a Mirena IUD had it been caught earlier. Fuck.",

I told him it's no different than one of my ear lobes being lower than the other. \n\nI had a tubal ligation after my second child. This was due to extreme morning sickness. I'm probably spelling this wrong, but I think the medical term is hyperemesis gravatium. In my first pregnancy, the morning sickness was so bad so early, I had an ultrasound because the doctor thought I was having multiples. I had to go on bed rest and went to the emergency room every day for fluids. I wound up losing 40lbs my first pregnancy and 70 lbs in my second. Both kids were full term and healthy weights despite this. \n\nSo even though I had my tubal in my early twenties, I am on birth control today because I had such heavy bleeding. The first time it happened, it was like I just gave birth, despite the tubal and being celibate for over a year. I thought maybe I imagined it or that it was a one off. In the following years, this became more and more frequent. Finally I got a obgyn who listened and put me on progesterone.  It was an answer to my prayers. I'd even once had a nurse who implied I had done something to myself deliberately to cause the heavy bleeding. What a bitch. \n\nAlso, I was raised in a fundamentalist religious culture, so I was not educated about anything to do with my body.  In my early adulthood, after I left that world, I decided to try to be responsible and go on birth control.  \nI dont even remember the name of what I went on, but my doctor says it was likely a estrogen based pill. This pill made me stark raving mad. Strangers would have me fuming over nothing. I stopped taking the pill after half a month.  If birth control changes your emotional state,  maybe it's not right for you. You arent crazy.",

    "body": "Recently I've seen a large influx of posts from people commenting that stopping all their products or missing out on their routine for a few days drastically improved their skin. With so many people reporting this, I figured making a trouble-shooting post about it for quick reference might really help! Maybe we can link to this post so these questions don't go unanswered while still prioritizing more rare or complex questions asked here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's LOOOTS of reasons why your skin may have improved with some down time, so here's some things to consider if (specifically) nothing has changed except discontinuing your routine! :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- You may have been cleansing too often. Maybe your cleanser is actually a good choice for your skin, but using it twice a day is more than your skin needs. Try skipping out on the morning cleanse and aim for once a day at night time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Your cleanser may be straight up too harsh. There's a lot of factors that can play into this, but if your skin feels tight, dry, 'squeaky clean', or uncomfortable after cleansing, it might be time to ditch that product. If you're looking for a more gentle or less drying cleansing method, consider the double cleanse! Start off with a non-fragrant oil to break everything down, and then go in with a gentle, fragrance free cleanser to whisk all that away. There's tons of posts on this sub addressing this method and providing product recs if you're interested.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- You're using micellar water and not washing it off. I realize micellar waters are marketed as cleansers that don't require water, but leaving surfactants on your skin can cause dryness and irritation. If you're going to use a micellar water, it should be part of a two step cleanse - It's not an excuse to skip out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- You're using makeup wipes. Cue the SCA police! /s. But seriously, same thing as micellar water - wipes are often irritating, tug and pull at the skin, and are fragrant. If you're going to use one, again, make it part of a two step cleansing process.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- User error. This is an interesting one, but definitely a point to be considered. Actives are all the rage these days (and for a good reason), but it's really easy to get carried away. If these were in your routine, consider cutting down how often you  use them. If your skin is looking better with some down time, maybe it's because it's recovering from over-exfoliating or persistent exposure to (what is normally good) actives. This also applies to manual scrubs and cleansing tools! Another thing to consider is how actives play a role with other products and when and where they should be used in your routine. For example: Using a retinoid when your skin is still wet can enhance irritation, and using an occlusive (like vaseline) over a retinoid can increase penetration and lead to increased irritation. Consider a method called buffering, and search this sub for how to specifically use certain actives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Your routine contains irritating or sensitizing ingredients. OOOOH boy. This is a long one, particularly because there's just so \\*many\\* things that can do this. But a good place to start evaluating ingredients is by checking for the following: Fragrance/parfum, alcohol, essential oils, fragrant plant oils, weird plant extracts (things like berries and flowers and shit),    methylchloroisothiazolinone (an irritating preservative), sodium lauryl sulfate, lanolin (which you can develop an allergy to), and dyes (particularly red dyes). Your product may also be formulated at an unsuitable pH. Checking for these things can get really overwhelming, but that's okay! Websites like Skincarisma and Cosdna break down individual product ingredients pretty well and can give you a good baseline when looking at a product. NOTE: Alcohol is not a bad ingredient!! But when you are specifically having problems, it's worth cutting out. NOTE: Fragrance is a no, regardless of whether you have a visible reaction to it or not. You can develop a fragrance allergy at any time. Fragrance has no place in skincare.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- You aren't wearing sunscreen. Yes, yes. We're vampires here at SCA. But seriously, using actives in a routine without sunscreen can really contribute to a multitude of problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- It's a you thing. This one sucks, but it's just the reality. Sometimes certain ingredients are generally well tolerated, but your skin alone reacts negatively to them. This is the case for me and coconut, jojoba, and rosehip oil, for example. Generally great ingredients, but they're just not for me. :( If you suspect a particular ingredient allergy/sensitivity, the only real way to verify this is to patch test. Everyone is different, and while studies can tell us what's generally not a good idea for our skin (fragrance, for example), a large part of skincare is trial and error.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- EDIT: You're using natural products, or you're DIYing something you shouldn't be. Sigh.. This one is sure to cause controversy, but hear me out. Natural is NOT better. Poison ivy is natural, but that doesn't make rubbing it on your face a good idea! The thing with 'natural' products is that many of them contain extracts (this kind of goes back to the sensitizing ingredient point). Plant extracts are not pure, single compounds (like glycerin, for example). These extracts consist of a conglomeration of different chemical compounds, and while a few of those parts may be good for your skin, a lot of those parts may not be. This is the advantage of having 'synthetic' products - you reduce the potential of having a reaction because there's fewer chemical compounds to interact with. The same applies to DIY skincare - just because you can eat it doesn't mean you should put it on your face. Also worth noting is that concentration of ingredients is vital when DIYing. Formulating is a complex science, but if you're set on making your own products (with substantiated science and actual commercial ingredients, I highly reccomend /r/DIYbeauty ). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Your skincare expired. CHECK EXPIRATION DATES PEOPLE!! I believe you can use  [http://www.checkfresh.com/](http://www.checkfresh.com/)  with a batch code to verify a product is still in a usable condition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf and when you decide to reintroduce your routine, I highly suggest going slow. One product at a time with patch testing (as hard as it is..). I personally think it's ideal to figure out your moisturizer game \\*first\\*, then your cleanser, and \\*then\\* your sunscreen. All in that order. Everything after that is supplemental anyway, and should be added in slowly once your baseline routine is established.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope these considerations and resources help! These are just a few reasons that come to mind, but please feel free to comment anything else to add down below. :)",

Specifically red eyeshadow for the nose and eyes, and a bit of yellow on the cheeks. The rest of the face is (unfortunately) mine. As for the hair and beard, that's mine as well, though I have grown it out for this, I usually wear it very short. Oh, and it doesn't really show in this pic, but I also applied a water/glycerin mix to the face with a mist spray bottle, for a permanent sweaty look.\n\nMost of the outfit were lucky finds in second hand shops, the big exception are the pants. It doesn't really show in this picture, but they are VERY flared. I originally thought that I would have to special order the shoes as well, but they too were a very lucky second hand find. Seems to be genuine (sorry to say) snakeskin leather, though they were originally black. The white rectangles on the blazer are from an old kitchen towel, cut up and glued on and enhanced with white paint.\n\nAs for the tote, I already had the yellow bag. It already has a printed pattern, though, so I just turned it inside out and hand-painted the Frittte logo.",

    "body": "Naisipan kong dumaan sa Watsons ngayong araw para bumili ng lotion, dahil paubos na yung ginagamit ko. Nakita ko tong lotion na 'to ng Luxe Organix na naka B1T1 for Php 405, kaya naisipan kong subukan. 2 variant yung binili ko, itong Retinol + Gluta, tsaka yung Niacinamide + Arbutin. \n\nTLDR:\n\nMay microfoaming, malakas ang fragrance, heavier skin feel kumpara sa ibang serum lotions sa Market, mali-mali ang IL, mislabeled dahil imbes na retinol, Retinyl Palmitate ang laman base sa IL. \n\nUnahin muna nating tingnan ang packaging. Sa unang tingin, di nalalayo material sa packaging ng mga serum lotion ng Vaseline. Tho, yung sa Vaseline, rounded yung tabas ng seal ng tube sa both sides, samantalang itong sa LO ay pointed. \n\nSa itsura naman mismo ng laman, off-white na medyo madilaw yung kulay ng lotion. Medyo clumpy din yung itsura pagkalabas nito sa tube, at madali ding mag-break yung emulsion upon skin contact. Malakas yung fragrance nya na dominated ng floral notes. Unang naisip ko nga nung naamoy ko e amoy poon, dahil sa sobrang floral. \n\nMedyo matagal ipahid sa balat, kumpara sa ibang serum lotion na nasubukan ko na. Naka-observe din ako ng microfoaming during application nitong lotion. Ang microfoaming ito yung nagkakaroon ng puti-puting streaks sa balat habang pinapahid ang isang product, kadalasan mga emulsion gaya ng lotion at creams. Ang microfoaming ay dulot ng pagkaka-trap ng air sa product habang ipinapahid sa balat. Kung ikukumpara ko ito sa ibang serum lotion na nagamit ko na (Vaseline Gluta-Hya Serum Burst Lotion, Smoochkins Nia-Arbutin Nano White Serum Lotion), ito yung pinaka heavy ang skin feel. Hindi ko masyadong na-feel yung pagka serum lotion. And lastly naka-experience din ako ng pamumula at pantal sa braso ko after ko gamitin itong lotion na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list. \n\nWater (Aqua), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Myristate, Fragrance, C15-19 Alkane, Stearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Triethanolamine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Glutathione, Polysorbate 20, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ceramide NP, Mannitol, Pentylene Glycol, CI19140, Phosphatidylcholine, Retinyl Palmitate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Polyglyceryl-10,  Citric Acid, Tocopherol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nHindi na talaga nawala ang mga errors sa IL ng mga local products. Di yata talaga uso ipa-check man lang sa regulatory personnel ang IL na ilalagay sa final layout ng packaging bago ang ipa-mass printing. Para sa product na ito, hindi Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol ang tamang INCI name, kung hindi Cetearyl Alcohol. Next, Polyglyceryl-10, what? Incomplete yung ingredient name. Ang daming Polyglyceryl-10 esters na nag eexist, wag nyo na kami paghulain. (Side Note: Ang Polyglyceryl-10 esters ay kadalasang ginagamit as non-ionic emulsifier sa cosmetics.). \n\nPangalawa kong napansin, CI19140. Ang CI19140 ay isang dye na kilala din bilang Tartrazine Yellow or FD&C Yellow #5. Ito yung nagbigay ng medyo madilaw na kulay sa lotion na ito. Konektado ito sa kasunod kong punto. \n\nIkatlo, bakit Retinyl Palmitate ang nakalista dito sa IL? Kaya nyo ba nilagyan ng Yellow #5 ang lotion na ito para magmukhang may retinol, kasi nakakapagdulot ng paninilaw sa mga product ang retinol kapag ihinalo ito? Ngayon, ano ba ang problema kung retinyl palmitate ang nakalagay, imbes na retinol? Ito kasi yun: maliban sa obvious na mislabelling sa product na ito, mas mababa ang potency ng retinyl palmitate kaysa sa retinol. Sa buong retinoid family, ang mga retinyl esters kagaya ng retinyl palmitate ang may pinakamababang potency, dahil kailangan pa nito ng isang extra conversion step (retinyl palmitate -> retinol). Tandaan, ang mga retinoids, kailangang ma-convert into retinoic acid para ma-activate ang retinoic acid receptors natin sa balat at makuha ang benefits. \n\nRetinyl esters -> Retinol -> Retinaldehyde -> Retinoic Acid\n\nKada conversion step, bumababa ang potency ng isang retinoid, kaya sa kaso ng retinyl palmitate, na isang retinyl ester, eto ang may pinakamababang potency. \n\nMay peptides din pala itong lotion na ito: Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9 at Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11.\n\nAng acetyl tetrapeptide-9 ay isang signaling peptide na nagbibigay ng message sa fibroblasts sa ating dermis na magproduce ng collagen (specifically Collagen Type 1) at proteoglycans, na mahalaga para mapanatili ang structure at mapanatiling tight (hindi sagging) ang balat natin.  Nakakatulong din itong mabawasan ang appearance ng fine lines sa mukha, dahil na rin sa stimulation ng collagen at proteoglycan production. \n\nKung ang dermis ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, ang epidermis naman ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-11. Kagaya ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, signaling peptide din ito na nagbibigay ng mensahe sa epidermis na mag-synthesize o magproduce ng Syndecan-1 at Collagen XVII. Kapag mataas ang dalawang ito sa balat, nag-iimprove ang elasticity ng balat. \n\nKaramihan ng mga nabanggit na benepisyo ng dalawang peptides na ito ay base pa lamang sa mga in-vitro studies na naisagawa na. Wala pang gaanong in-vivo clinical studies na lumabas kaya medyo skeptical pa din ako sa mga peptides na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo lastly sa product claims. \n\n* Retinol + Gluta\n\n* Whitening Serum Lotion\n\n* Lightening\n\n* Firming\n\n* Hydrating\n\n* 24 hr Supple Smooth\n\n* 3X Peptide Youth Repair + Hyaluronic Bright + Ceramide Glow\n\nUnang claim pa lang, sablay na. Wala namang retinol tong lotion na 'to. Pinaglololoko ako nitong LO e. \n\nSa claim na lightening at whitening, medyo duda ako. Mukhang glutathione lang ang pwedeng masabi ng brand na ito na skin lightening ingredient. Pero duda ako sa efficacy ng glutathione na makapagpa lighten ng skin topically. Maraming limitations yung mga published studies tungkol sa efficacy ng topically applied gluta, gaya ng mababang bilang ng participants sa studies at sobrang iksi na study period. \n\nSa claim na firming, mukhang inilagay ito gawa nung mga peptides. Sa hydrating claim, meron namang hydrating ingredients (glycerin, hyaluronic acid derivatives, olive oil, Plukenetia Volubilis oil, tsaka Ceramide NP). Same din dun sa mga sumunod na claims, dahil sa presence ng mga nabanggit na ingredients. \n\n\nFinal words:\n\nHindi ako masaya sa nabili kong lotion na 'to. Hindi kasing lightweight at fast absorbing nung iba kong nasubukan na serum lotions. Amoy poon yung fragrance. May microfoaming during application. Nagkapantal ako sa braso. Mali-mali ang IL. Pero yung pinaka disappointing sa lotion na 'to e yung claim na may retinol daw, pero retinyl palmitate lang ang nasa ingredient list. May paglalagay pa ng yellow dye para magmukhang may retinol. Napakalaking red flag para sa akin ang pagmi-mislabel ng product.\n\nAyun lang. Salamat sa pagbabasa. At laging maging mapanuri sa mga binibili at balak nating gamitin na products. \n\n",

    "body": " \n\nQuick Note - There's no way to know how sweaty *Fast Five* is ([it's wildly sweaty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2PsfXZ3wyY)). However, I tried my best to provide a reasonable number to a very random subject. \n\nI love the *Fast & Furious* franchise, and have pretty much [analyzed every aspect of the nine movies that have been released since 2001](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/gnzkuk/i_wanted_to_know_which_of_the_nine_fast_furious/). With the 10th anniversary of *Fast Five* coming up, I remembered Shea Serrano (read his book *Movies (And Other Things)*), and copious publications talking about how sweaty Dwayne Johnson, and the rest of the characters in *Fast Five* are. These observations are correct, after rewatching the movie again, it’s clear that several characters seem to swim in Evian spray and glycerin concoctions that keep them looking like the characters from *Deep Blue Sea* after they’ve been waterlogged for several hours. \n\nIn honor of *Fast Five’s* upcoming 10th anniversary (April 29), here’s an in-depth study that compares the sweat output of Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) to the other central protagonists. \n\n**Data Collection**\n\n* I rewatched *Fast Five*, and took notes of the scenes that featured characters sweating. For example, when Dwayne Johnson sweats while looking at a computer, the note “Hobbs sweats while he is thinking” was included. The note were meticulous.\n* I only included the sweat I saw on screen. This data is weird enough, I didn’t want to include hypothetical sweat. This meant I looked at arm, forehead, goatee, neck, chest, and shirt sweat. Also, there’s no way I could get a 100% correct answer, so like my other data posts, I went out of my way to make sure the data makes sense via research and actual testing.\n* What does on screen sweat mean? I only noted the sweat I saw because I wanted to have somewhat reliable data. Sure, the characters sweat when they are offscreen, and it’s an absolute possibility that Hobbs sweats when he brushes his teeth. But, the viewer never sees the perspiration, so to include hypothetical sweat would involve way too much unreliable guesswork. \n* Initially, actual sweat science was going to be applied to each character. However, the varying degrees to which the characters sweat (or don’t sweat at all), kept actual real world data from being used. Basically, Hobbs sweats while he does nothing, whereas, Roman (Tyrese) never sweats during his time in Brazil. While researching the film, I’ve learned the *Fast* world is filled with incredibly non-sweaty people, and a few super-sweaters whose perspiration is inspirational.\n* To figure out how much they were sweating I used a few different methods. To not be a total jabroni, I went outside and cleaned gutters, moved around some concrete pieces from a slab that was recently broken up (I wish I had the idea a couple weeks ago), and jumped rope to get sweat data. I weighed my shirt beforehand, then weighed it again during various periods of sweat. \n* I used a food scale to weigh the shirts, and I used drops of water to recreate the sweat. \n* The weather was quite wonderful, so I wasn’t able to completely drench my shirt with sweat. That’s why I had to use other methods\n* I used four shirts (V-neck and Under Armour), and I meticulously added water to pits, neckline, back and eventually the entire shirt. I weighed them during each step to make sure I had enough data. I didn’t soak the shirts under my sink, then flop them onto a scale. Care was taken to recreate the sweat (Yes, it’s weird). \n* I didn’t bother researching sweat density compared to water. Why? Since the *Fast* world is so bonkers, I figured water would be a fine substitute. \n\n**Another Quick Note:** This data is not 100% correct. The world will never know how much each character in *Fast Five* sweats. However, because I’m a maniac, the results are fair, and they are a solid representation of what we see onscreen. \n\n**How much does Luke Hobbs sweat in Fast Five?**\n\n* **Amount of Swea**t - 4 ¼ cups of water (34 fluid ounces of sweat - 1.0055 liter)\n* **Sweatiest Moment?** \\- After [Hobbs is done chasing Dom through the streets of Rio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmm8P0V1W4g&list=PLZbXA4lyCtqq8wvgVs410T8v9OAixWg3B&index=3), his shirt, bullet-proof vest, head and arms are soaked. It’s impressive.\n* **Does he sweat too much?** \\- Who am I to say? However, there’s a moment when his goatee sweats more than three grown men.\n* **Hardest Part of Data Collection** \\- The finale of the film sees Hobbs fighting Dom (lots of sweat), [engaging in a gunfight (more sweat)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aldDI2WF7g&list=PLZbXA4lyCtqq8wvgVs410T8v9OAixWg3B&index=8), and then [helping Dom (more sweat)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEAsC8A1Ins&list=PLZbXA4lyCtqq8wvgVs410T8v9OAixWg3B&index=10). The problem is, his shirt would be sweaty all day, so it was hard to gauge how much sweat poured out of him. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ctrd4v1bjqu61.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cfdbf229ea61822393014a7456fdc02b652b9a1\n\n**How much do the protagonists (Dom, Brian, Roman, Tej, Mia, Han, Gisele, Vince, Leo, Santos ) sweat in Fast Five?**\n\n* **Amount of Sweat** \\- 3 cups of water (24 fluid ounces of water - .709 Liter)\n* **Sweatiest Moment** \\- While Vince has some wonderfully sweaty moments, the fight between Hobbs and Dom features Dom getting very sweaty.\n* **Do they sweat too much?** \\- Nope - [The crew rarely sweat. Does that make them cool? Are they so cool that they don’t sweat?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN1BjYlhKvc&list=PLZbXA4lyCtqq8wvgVs410T8v9OAixWg3B&index=6)\n* **Hardest Part of Data Collection** \\- The characters rarely sweat. Dom, Vince, Mia and Brian are the main culprits. I had to give my full attention to catching sweat droplets. I never thought I’d ever do something like this….\n\nDiscussing the robbery in a hot warehouse - No sweat\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oz98fpb7jqu61.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c1cb4d91ea902fdced373ea9f9f8432a72956904\n\nTej has been working in his hot Miami garage. No sweat\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vejerrb2jqu61.png?width=577&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ea0079150fa76b6be6d84ecf8e920d88e15813f\n\nFinally! Sweat. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1k4141f1jqu61.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4cb793fc60712fddb6237ca4776d82bec3bc854a\n\nInitially, the results were surprising because it was a bit of stretch to consider that one character could sweat more than 10 other characters. However, after watching the movie again, there’s no comparison. It’s fair to say that the most unbelievable aspect of *Fast Five* is not the bank vault chase, it’s the fact that Hobbs sweats so much more than any other character. Even his team never sweats, and they have to take a car apart, and then put it back together - in a hot workshop. \n\nThey aren’t sweaty….He is. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6efzut8xiqu61.png?width=803&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f83460cb3b622337f2acca7cef792b42a88f202\n\nMaybe it’s Johnson’s background in wrestling that taught him to always be spritzing, or that he went  method as he saw Hobbs as someone who sweats more than any human alive. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ffi0riwdjqu61.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7be90c9a7ed6d18f395cc16ef2e0c9de497e7d8f\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/n594h8wyiqu61.gif\n\n**Conclusion** \\- Hobbs is a very sweaty person. All of the observations were correct.\n\n**If you like this random post, make sure to check out my other random data on Reddit.**\n\n[Movies featuring snowmobile action scenes are way cooler than movies featuring jet ski action scenes](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a6pkia/movies_featuring_snowmobile_action_scenes_have_an/)\n\n[Analyzing the unnecessarily large trap in Predators](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8lazju/the_unsuccessful_and_unnecessarily_large_trap/)\n\n[How old is MacGruber?](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/gf78us/using_clues_from_the_2010_film_macgruber_i/)\n\n[The Con Air seating chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/jsa8hc/after_several_viewings_of_con_air_that_involved/)\n\n[Jacked Up -

When the cast started negotiating their contracts for the sixth film they all demaded in writing that their character wouldn't lose a fight.  Which is why if you pay attention, none of the characters ever lose any fights and all major character square offs end in some weird stalemate.",

Plus they’re so packable! Sharpie for scale. https://i.imgur.com/gGkv5Ja.jpg\n\nI do keep my micellar water in an old makeup remover sample bottle from Sephora since it holds a bit more but I used to use a tube for that too and it worked great.\n\nProducts:\n\nMineral oil: I use this to remove waterproof makeup (very rare). Gets the job done with minimal effort and ingredients.\n\nGarnier micellar water, pink cap: I use this on a microfiber cloth instead of washing my face and it’s so much less drying for me than soap.\n\nA-Ret gel 0.025%: been on this about six months. Most of the purging and peeling is over and I’m enjoying the tret glow. Hoping to bump up to 0.04% micro soon.\n\nHada Labo Gokujyun Premium: HG, my skin loves hyaluronic acid and this has 5 kinds. FA-safe and mild. Also great on lips.\n\nAvene tolerance extreme cleansing lotion: this is supposed to be a cold cream that you wipe off but I use it as moisturizer. It has the same exact ingredients as the popular Tolerance Emulsion... but it’s LESS money for 6x the product or something crazy like that! FA-safe, super mild, but adds a nice level of creaminess to my moisturizing routine that I really needed.\n\nAquaphor lip therapy: the ONLY lip balm that healed my cracking, peeling chapped lips. I’m sensitive to lanolin so many popular options were just making it worse. This contains lovely ingredients like glycerin, panthenol, Shea butter and castor oil. I feel like the moisture from this balm actually sinks in.\n\nIn case you’re wondering, I use OGX Bonding Plex shampoo and conditioner (it’s one of very few formulas that doesn’t give me body acne).\n\nHappy trails!",

My conditioner was probably the hardest and it really isn't that hard.\n\nIn the past, I've put foundation, CC cream, even liquid highlighter in these. I've mixed aquaphor with a sliver of lipstick to make my own tinted balms. I usually carry one full of my face sunscreen (Nivea Sun Protect Super Water Gel 50+++) in my purse for on-the-go reapplications; this amount fits 10ish face sized blobs. I'll even do body sunblock if I know I'm going to need 1 or 2 body reapplications in a day (e.g., if I'm going to a baseball game or a long hike or something).\n\nCan you tell I hate carrying excess product? I'm a major minimalist when it comes to packing, whether it's my luggage for a trip or my purse for one day. This method saves space, saves weight, never leaks, squeezes easily, is more hygienic than pots/jars, and is sleek enough to fit into the tiniest of bags. Big fan over here.",

After being chronically ill for five years severely, I had developed thin old lady skin, and wanted to reverse that\n4.\t⁠reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles\n\nFor the first 30 days, I used red light and NuFace daily. I did 2 1/2 minutes on the left side of my face, 2 1/2 minutes straight on, and 2 1/2 minutes on the right side of my face. I was 14” away from the panel. However, after a few weeks I noticed baby hairs sprouting in my “deep M widows peak” hairline. This was shocking, particularly because I had severe postpartum hair loss and it never grew back (my oldest is almost 7). I tried every single supplement known to man, and even went on hormone replacement therapy. The hair never ever grew! After one month and seeing the new hair growth, I added a five minutes alongside either of my hairline, <6” away from the panel.\n\nThen I read an article about cumulative dose issues, and realized I needed to start taking rest days. I started a three days on, one day off protocol, and that’s what I continue to do now.\n\nI’m really happy with the results!! I’m using a HOOGA HG300 I got on Black Friday sale for $127. I got the oldest cheapest NuFace mini. Other things I believe have contributed to my results— I apply Corsx peptide serum and a glycerin based green tea extract (St Croix brand on amazon) twice a day before my moisturizer. ",

        "body": "I have a question that I don't see anything about elsewhere, about water weight from medical steroids.\n\nI have multiple sclerosis (no restrictions on exercise or weight loss/gain) and I had to spend a few days in the hospital recently getting IV steroids (solumedrol), followed by two weeks of a steroid taper (prednisone).  I finished the IV steroids on or about the 10th of Feb., with the taper (60mg of prednisone, then taking 10mg less every 2 days), ending the 22nd of Feb.  \n\nI'm no doctor, but my understanding is that these steroids cause water retention, as well as increased appetite.  Certainly, for a while after being released from the hospital, I was over 10lbs. more than what I was before entering the hospital.  If that were still the case, I would expect it to be a disqualifying factor (although I see nothing about it in the rules), since I would certainly lose the water weight over 12 weeks and have an unfair advantage.  However, I have recently come back to my traditional weight (+/- a couple pounds depending on what time of day I'm measured), although I can't be sure that there isn't still water retention and I just happened to lose weight at the same time.  After typing all of this out, it seems to be a minor point, but I just wanted to get confirmation that I can still enter the contest.  If it matters, I plan on waiting until the last possible day to take the photos, for this reason.  \n\nCheers",

    "body": "\nNgayong araw i-rereview ko ang Hikari Ultrawhite Sunscreen. Bago pa na-i-launch yung tinted sunscreen ng same brand, sobrang hype nito sa Tiktok, at marami na ding mga content creators sa Tiktok ang nakapagreview dito. Magbabahagi lamang ako dito ng point of view ko bilang isang cosmetic chemist at titingnan at magkukumento ako sa mga technical na detalye na nakapaloob dito sa produkto na ito. \n\nBago ang lahat, binili ko itong product sa legitimate na distributor ng brand sa Tiktok. Marami na kasi akong napanuod na videos nung CEO ng brand na kung saan sinabi nya na pinepeke daw ang product na ito. Gusto ko lang na lehitimong product ang gagawan ko ng review. Saktong sakto din na fresh batch yung dumating kong order, dahil kita naman sa batch code nito na nitong April 2025 lang ito na-produce. \n\nPagkabukas ko pa lamang ng product, ang unang bumungad sa akin ay ang fragrance nito. May kalakasan ang fragrance nito na may floral at milky scent. Maaring di akma ang produkto na ito sa mga end user na may sensitivity sa mga fragrance. \n\nSunod kong napansin ay yung kulay nito. Makikita nyo sa pic na kulay pink itong product. Mahalaga itong property na ito ng sunscreen kaya balikan ko ito mamaya. \n\nKapag inilagay na sa daliri yung product para sukatin ito bago ipahid sa balat, napansin ko na medyo nagtutubig or nagiging runny. Babalikan ko din ito mamaya pagdating natin sa analysis ng ingredient list nitong product. \n\nKapag ipinahid na ito sa balat, lightweight naman ang texture nito. Madaling ma-blend at walang white cast, na ok para sa moreno kong balat. Wala din akong napansin na pilling o paglilibag during application nitong sunscreen. So far, so good. \n\nNgayon, tumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list:\n\nAqua, Glycerin, Octyl, Methoxycinnamate, Dimethicone, Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Leaf Extract, Hyaluronic Acid, Polypodium Extract, Baicalin (Scutellaria Root Extract), Phenoxyethanol, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Carbomer 940 & Fragrance\n\nKung nabasa nyo na yung previous review ko sa Hikari Premium Sun Perfect Tinted Sunscreen Broad Spectrum, lahat ng typographic errors  at maling INCI name ng ingredient na nasa ingredient list ay nandito din sa Hikari Ultrawhite Sunscreen. Ang kinaibahan lang, yung tinted, may Niacinamide at Vitamin E. \n\nNgayon, balikan natin yung kulay nitong sunscreen na ito. Sa ingredient list, wala akong makita na ingredient na naging dahilan kung bakit naging kulay pink itong sunscreen. Walang colorant na ginamit. Sa mga nakalistang ingredients, walang isa jan ang kulay pink. So kung ano man ang nakakapagpa-pink jan ay hindi nakadeclare. Bakit kaya? \n\nBalikan naman natin yung napansin ko na nagtutubig yung product kapag in-contact na sa daliri. Marami akong nakitang users na sa Tiktok na nagtataka bakit daw watery or nagtutubig yung sunscreen. Dahil yan sa carbomer (ito ang tamang INCI names hindi  Carbomer 940). Ano ba itong carbomer na ito? Itong ingredient na ito, kapag ihinalo sa tubig at inadjust ang pH sa 5-7, pinalalapot nito ang tubig at nagiging gel. Ito gel na ito ay inherently na nagbe-break kapag ito ay napadikit o nalagyan ng ions. And since sagana ang ating balat sa ions (mula sa pawis, at naiiwan sa balat kahit natuyuan na ng pawis), expected talaga na magbe-break yung gel at magtutubig. \n\nNabanggit ko na din lamang na kailangang i-adjust ang pH ng tubig na may carbomer para lumapot, bakit kaya hindi nakalista sa ingredient list yung mga neutralizing agents (halimbawa: sodium hydroxide, triethanolamine) na normal namang ginagamit kapag may carbomer sa formulation? Napansin  ko din ito dun sa tinted version ng sunscreen ng Hikari. \n\nIsa pang napansin ko sa magkaparehong sunscreen ng Hikari, bakit hindi nakalista yung emulsifier na ginamit? Papaanong nabuo itong gel cream na ito kung walang emulsifier? Kasi kung walang emulsifier sa mga sunscreen na binanggit ko, hindi mabubuo at maghihiwalay lang yung water at oil phase ng mga unscreen na yan. Baka naman meron, pero di lang inilista? Kung meron man, dapat nakadeklara yan, alinsunod sa Cosmetic Labelling Requirements ng ASEAN Cosmetic Directive. This applies din dun sa mga nauna kong binanggit (yung nagpapapink dito sa sunscreen, at yung neutralizing agent na ginamit para sa carbomer). Paano kaya to nakalusot sa FDA? \n\nNgayon punta naman tayo sa mga product claims nito na may concern ako:\n\n* UVA/UVB SPF 50 PA++++\n* Non-comodogenic\n* Repairs sun damage\n\nItong sunscreen na ito ay gumagamit ng tatlong UV filters:\n\n* Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (ganito ang tamang INCI name) \n* Zinc Oxide\n* Titanium Dioxide\n\nAng Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate at Titanium Dioxide ay parehong UVB filters, samantalang ang Zinc Oxide naman ay UVA/UVB filter. Ang tanong ko lang, papaanong pumalo ng SPF 50 ang rating nito at may PA++++ rating pa, samantalang mas mababa pa ang concentration ng zinc oxide at titanium dioxide sa phenoxyethanol? Assuming na isinagad sa 1% yung phenoxyethanol, ibig sabihin nito, mababa pa sa 1% yung zinc oxide at titanium dioxide. Papaanong papalo yan ng SPF 50 at magkakaroon ng PA++++ sa ganyang kababang amount? Napapaisip tuloy ako kung SPF tested ba talaga to. May pinakita na bang SPF test result para sa sunscreen na ito, pati na din dun sa tinted? Kasi diba ganun ang uso sa mga local brand owner ng sunscreen, kanya kanyang lapag ng SPF test report as part of their marketing? \n\nDoon naman sa NON-COMODOGENIC, please lang, uso ang mag proof-read bago mag-approve ng packaging layout ha. Kasimple-simple e. \n\nSa claim na \"Repairs sun damage\", bawal yang claim na yan dahil ini-imply na may physiological effect (repair sun damage) ang sunscreen na yan, na dapat wala, dahil iyan ay isang cosmetic product. Yung mga claims na ganyan na may physiological effect e papasok na sa drug category, at hindi na sa cosmetics. Paano kaya nakalusot to sa FDA? \n\nFinal words:\nMula sa formulation, claims, at ingredient list, napansin ko na ang daming problema nitong product na ito (maging yung tinted version nito). Sana naman e ma-review ito ng brand owner para ma-address yung mga punto na nabanggit ko dito. \n\nSa FDA naman, wag naman sana basta-basta approve ng approve ng CPN ng mga cosmetic products ng hindi na-a-assess ng maayos. Kaya bumababa ang kumpiyansa ng mga tao sa locally produced cosmetics e.\n\nAyun lang, maraming salamat sa pagbabasa. ",

    "body": "I just came back from the second dermatologist appointment I've had in the last year in which the dermatologist outright contradicted many things assumed as common knowledge in this sub. I had taken photos of my AM and PM routines so I could share them with her and get any feedback. When she saw the photos she said:\n\n* \"Cerave? In the tub? That's not for facial use, that's just for the body. It's far too dense for the face.\"\n\n* \"Vaseline? That's comedogenic; it will completely clog your pores!\" When I said I was using it as an occlusive she said \"well, it's far *too* occlusive!\"\n\n* After seeing rosehip seed oil and squalene oil in my routine: \"You need to be careful with oils; they can break you out really easily.\"\n\n* And overall: \"Your routine is way too complicated; your acne will never go away if you're using so many products.\"\n\nSo I totally get that not every derm is the same, and obviously product success varies widely. However, she's a derm I've never seen before and I specifically asked for an appointment with a new doctor because the one I saw last year similarly didn't jive at all with the general consensus of this sub. \n\nHonestly, it weirds me out a little bit because I'm terrified of being the skincare equivalent of a close-minded parent who doesn't vaccinate their kids because of some fear-mongering Facebook group, regardless of what the educated medical community says. Am I totally a sucker for potential snake oil salesmen in disguise on this sub (I love you this community and don't think that feels true, but I'm examining everything!) or is my dermatologist not seeing the whole picture?\n\n(For context, I saw the derm for persistent acne that's plagued me for 15 years now, but I have seen marginal improvement since following advice in this sub. I got the appointment in the first place because I've grown impatient with nothing working quite to the extent I would hope for, and I'm really sick of years of not wanting to take photos of myself.)\n\n\n**EDIT: Thank you so much for the responses so far; they are super helpful!** \n\nFor those asking, in case it's helpful for any more ideas/feedback, here's the current over-complicated routine I brought to my derm:\n\nAM:\n\n* CeraVe Foaming Cleanser\n\n* Trader Joe's Rose Water hydrating toner (\"stop using that, it has alcohol!\" my derm said when she saw it!)\n\n* The Ordinary HA Acid 2%\n\n* The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% and Zinc 1%\n\n* CosRx Snail Mucin Essence\n\n* HadaLabo gokujyun Premium lotion (the gold bottle)\n\n* The Ordinary Squalane oil - (only on especially dry days; not every time)\n\n* Sunscreen: either Biore Watery Essence for mostly indoor days or Neutrogena Dry Touch SPF 50 for outdoor/long commute days\n\nPM:\n\n* Garnier Micellar water with Rose and Glycerin (for makeup removal)\n\n* Miso mineral cleansing oil\n\n* Tretinoin 0.05%\n\n* The Ordinary Rosehip Seed Oil (for dryer days only; usually I end up using this 3-4 times a week)\n\n* Cerave in the tub\n\n* Vaseline\n\nAny advice on cutting this back is very welcome! \n\nAlso, she prescribed me spironolactone which is one of the few prescription medicines for acne that I haven't yet tried, so hopefully between that and the Tret which I already had, I'll see more drastic improvement. \n\n**Overall,** I think that my big takeaway from this conversation is that I can put a LOT more stock in \"YMMV\" than I have been. I'm going to trust my derm, but also follow my instincts. If I'm totally honest, there have been a few times when I've stripped my moisture barrier and sprayed my face with toner and it stung a lot, and then lathered on Cerave and it stung even more, and I just dealt with it because of some weird no-pain-no-gain complex I have. (gulp) But actually, had I listened to my instincts more maybe I'd have stopped products like that before now. There's an emotional component here about trusting myself, I think! Anyway, I'm super grateful for the wealth of knowledge and experience in this sub, so thank you for the support!!",

A simple routine is really all you need if she is already having you on a retinoid and something to help the hormonal acne (spiro).\n\nIt may be frustrating to hear but oils and occlusives WILL break you out if you are naturally acne-prone. Look, some people can put all the oils and even vaseline on their faces and not get clogged but I'm pretty sure if I even put aquaphor a little too densely on my lips I will get clogs along the perimeter on my mouth. I saw a really great aesthetician who put me on a strict skincare routine and my skin was SO DRY for the first couple weeks because I was overcompensating before with too many oils, but once my natural oils came back my skin cleared up so much. Now I religiously avoid oils and occlusives and stick to my vitamin c, retinol, oil-free moisturizer, and mineral sunscreen daily and it's been the best answer that I would've never gotten to if I tried to chase after what works for everyone else who is less acne-prone. \n\nPlease trust your dermatologist. I've been in your shoes and it paid off to stick with the prescribed routine once I passed 3+ months!",

Some kids are harmed by vaccination. What they fail to appreciate is that for every child who has an adverse reaction to a vaccine, many thousands of children would have died from Polio or Diphtheria. \n\nMy empathy goes out to you, and if you are like me, your acne is not nearly as bad to others as it feels to you.\n\nI think your thinking is very rational, and I suggest that you give your doctor a fair shake, and take her advice.\n\nIf it doesn’t work, in 6 months you can go back to your oils.",

    "body": "Hi, and welcome to my TED talk that absolutely no one asked for! Theories are theories and they can open up fun discussions! But sometimes people generally believe theories even if they go against canon, and it’s good to look at things from all angles so that people don’t get confused and have all of the information that they need in order to judge what they think may be right and what they think may be wrong.\n\nSo, here it is:\n\n“There’s a theory that Bakugo’s anger and constant adrenaline is his body’s way of dealing with his quirk and keeping him alive. Because nitroglycerin can lower a person’s heart rate dramatically, so if he’s not constantly stressed he would literally pass out.\nWould also make sense cuz he only started being so angry all the time after his quirk manifested.”\n\nFirst and foremost, nitroglycerin does not lower the heart rate (it possibly could if you have issues of heart problems like heart attack or failure or taking other medications). I’ve seen people mention that quite a bit in that thread from before, but I’m sure people will want some proof. So, I’ve searched it up for you.\n\n[1](https://www.healthtap.com/questions/198989-does-nitroglycerin-raise-the-heart-rate/)\n[2](https://www.ehealthme.com/ds/nitroglycerin/heart-rate-increased/)\n[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1380023/)\n[4](https://www.healthline.com/health/nitroglycerin-sublingual-tablet#side-effects)\n\nBut let’s ignore the science of it all for a bit and go into the story and the character itself!\n\nReeling back all the way to the beginning, this is what Bakugo’s personality was originally supposed to be like:\nhttps://gyazo.com/3c1e0af8b5c3fee9aba472e6bc6aadb0\n\nHe wasn’t the ball full of anger and outbursts (which as he has developed that has lessened) that he is \"today\".\n\nNow moving forward to his current [design](https://66.media.tumblr.com/913ce515a13528bfd7f02127901f9d13/tumblr_pfdedpDCFs1uqbp07_1280.jpg)\n\nIt is stated that his quirk is “nitroglycerin-like” not full on nitroglycerin, and yet some could argue “potato-pototo” (ignoring that nitroglycerin doesn’t even lower the heart rate), it is also stated that Bakugo’s quirk does not have any big draw backs. And I mean, I think being angry all the time, fainting, and possible death is a pretty big draw back.\n\nNow onto Bakugo’s parents:\n\n[Masaru](https://bokunoheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/Masaru_Bakugo)\n[Mitsuki](https://bokunoheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/Mitsuki_Bakugo)\n\nBakugo’s mom secrets glycerin, while his dad secrets acid sweat, hence “nitroglycerin-like”. Also, did you know his dad likes classical music? Learn something new everyday!\n\nBakugo’s mom has also stated why Bakugo is the way he is. You can go back and watch or read the scene, but she said it was because he was praised a lot as a kid. And honestly, that is a HUGE part of his character arc, which is essentially him getting “vibe-checked” or whatever the word is that the kids are using! I’ll get into that a bit later, though.\n\nAnyway, let’s look at how Bakugo was after he developed his [quirk!](https://cdn.read7deadlysins.com/file/AnimeRleases/MHA_0001-015.png)\n\nLook, at everyone going crazy, while he’s just chilling, which is probably how he usually is in school (I don't think the teachers would tolerate him being all wild in class). If you ever see Bakugo alone in the anime or manga, he’s usually just relaxing. Remember when they went to their summer camp and were all bathing together? Bakugo was just in the back by himself relaxing. He could get angry. He could tell them all to shut up or whatever, but he’s just chilling. Also, I don’t know too many people who are hyped or stressed while they’re sleeping. ~~(It’s me. I’m stressed while I’m sleeping!)~~ Sleep calms the body and usually lowers the heart rate. And Bakugo goes to bed at like 8:42, so it’s not as if he has all this anger and energy that’s preventing him from doing so.\n\nI do feel like I’ve said enough, but why not just go into his character and the way the series itself views Bakugo’s behavior.\n\nSo, Bakugo is on top of the world. Constantly praised (even by the one who he bullied), etc. etc. Then he goes to U.A. and realizes that he has competition. Now he’s angry at everything! Before, most of that if not all was directed towards Deku.\n\n[After all](https://cdn.read7deadlysins.com/file/AnimeRleases/MHA_0001-016.png)\n\nI mean look at that. He’s off the wall a bit, but he’s not angry. Not like when he gets teased at U.A. Even with the infamous “jump off the roof” line, he’s laughing as he does this, and arrogantly, too. I can’t seem to remember (seriously, let me know) but has Bakugo laughed at all when he was at U.A.? I thiiink when Cami did that glamour, but that is after his character turn around starts.\n\nEven when he and Midoriya go to take the entrance exam he’s not exactly the way he is after getting “checked”,  even as he tells Midoriya “that means I can’t crush you.” He’s still all arrogant and stuff at this point thinking he’s the best, because he’s been told that countless times.\n\nSo, when the fated day comes and he squares off with Midoriya at their first hero training lesson as well as sees everyone else’s quirks and how good they are. He ends up crying, and this is when that anger starts to REALLY come into play. The explosive anger that we start to see comes when he realizes that he may not be the best after all. He leaves school early and cries with a declaration about how he’s going to pass All Might.\n\nI’m going to fast forward to Bakugo vs Deku. It’s been awhile since I’ve seen/read this, so please bare with me. It’s been some time coming, and Bakugo knows that something is up between All Might and Midoriya. He wants to know why All Might choose Midoriya and if his admiration for All Might was wrong all along as well as all of the emotions that had been bottled up inside of him finally exploding (heh). He feels like he forced All Might into retirement. And this is why his anger and emotions towards Midoriya have increased, not because he needs to be angry.\n\nSo, imagine that the above theory is true (despite nitroglycerin not being able to slow the heart rate and besides the fact that Bakugo’s quirk does not have big draw backs and besides the fact that he doesn’t even sweat nitroglycerin):\n\n-Hori saying that Bakugo needs to apologize to Midoriya will be ruined because he has an excuse\n\n-Bakugo’s feelings towards Midoriya are more meaningless less personal\n\n-Bakugo starting to become a better person is meaningless (and by the way will never happen unless he's properly diagnosed)\n\n-All of Bakugo’s feelings that led him to fighting Midoriya was just his quirk influencing him, so the fight he had with Midoriya might as well be just any other physical action he made to him before he got into U.A.\n\nNow, here’s how Bakugo’s arc ends. He goes to a doctor and the doctor tells him what’s up, because literally no one in that universe who knows Bakugo not even book smart Momo could tell him the effects of nitroglycerin (did I say it doesn’t lower the heart rate?), and the doctor tells him “No, son, you’re not a compelling character at all. You’re just like this because of your quirk! In fact, forget the last 273 chapters; you are now a tragic character.”\n\nAnd the Bakugo goes to apologize to Midoriya with a:\n[“Yeah, sorry, it was just my quirk.”](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/yeah-sorry) <----Naruto Spoilers\n\nTLDR: Nitroglycerin does not slow the heart rate, Bakugo sweats something that’s “nitroglycerin-like”, as said by the mangaka, Bakugo’s quirk does not have any big drawbacks, and his characterization is much, much deeper than 'his quirk makes him like that.'\n\nAlso: Sorry, if I sounded too meme-y and rude at the end! You can have fun and theorize if you want to, and debunking this was fun for me as well!",

We buy houses from estates and clean out a lot of old stuff. It’s is usual to see oil and banned pesticides and such. But clue me in on how to spot dynamite. Or anything else that could endanger us!\n\n**StarSlayerX**  \nThere an old family joke that Great Grandpa stored his dynamite in an onion sack... I opened the old shed, saw a mesh sack with old cylindrical tubes in it... Knew right away I am fucked.\n\nFamily joke came true unfortunately.\n\n-----------\n\n**smokesnugs-YT**  \nThis is actually so irresponsible and shitty of your great grandfather... seems like he didnt really give a dam about the safety of his family if he would keep something like this around the house without proper maintenance.... just asking to kill one of his loved ones because of his incompetence and irresponsibility.\n\n**StarSlayerX**\nGreat Grandpa always did things his way... Exposed electrical wire at the well and house, farm equipment hazard repaired, etc...\n\n--------\n\n**DuffBeer1323**\nhe passed away on christmas eve?\n\n**StarSlayerX**\nNo he passed away a few years go, I just discovered this today.\n\n--------\n\n**prajnadhyana**\nYou would have to be insane to even touch that.\n\n**StarSlayerX**\nThank god I didn't touch it! I am calling the Police Department Tuesday and see what the disposal procedures are.\n\n**prajnadhyana**\nYou won't like them.  They will probably just detonate it in place. Good luck!\n\n**StarSlayerX**\nFUCK! I am too afraid to pull out anything in that shed now.\n\n**prajnadhyana**\nThat white stuff is most likely pure nitroglycerin. Once dynamite has done that it's super sensitive and extremely dangerous.\n\n-----------\n\n**Exotic_Sandwich3342**  You still alive OP?\n\n **StarSlayerX**  Yes, I am calling the Police Department tomorrow.\n\n------------\n\n\n**Skorn17**\nWhat did your grandpa do that he had extra dynamite literally just hanging around?\n\n**StarSlayerX**\nMy Great Grandpa was a farmer. I think he used it to build the crawl space in his house.\n\n------\n\n**Jim_e_Clash**\n Okay okay. I know everyone is warning you how dangerous this is, but....Have you considered that New Years is right around the corner?\n\nI'm just saying, maybe your great grandpa wanted you to blow the ever loving shit out of that shed at the stroke of midnight.\n\n**StarSlayerX** \nYes also Great Grandpa envisioned my home (Was His) to have a new entry way straight into the kitchen.\n\n-------\n\n**llcdrewtaylor**\nIf OP is in the USA, some fire department is about to get really tense for a bit. As a retired emergency service worker, I am just picturing all the people who will get called out tonight for this!\n\n**StarSlayerX** \nI am calling Tuesday... if it has not exploded in the last 40 years... I think I be fine for another two days.\n\n-----\n\n**ilaughatpoliticians**\nOP, are you alive? OK? Please blink twice if your head is still attached. Haven't seen an update to this from you and hoping you didn't mess with it. I even googled \"City Block Leveled by Deceased Grandpa\" and found nothing.\n\nPlease get experts involved here. And remember, \"Ex\" is part of \"expert\", so if there's an \"ex\"-spouse, \"ex\"-friend, \"ex\"-lover, \"ex\"-boss, et al, you can call them in to start the process.\n\n**StarSlayerX**\nStill alive, calling police department tomorrow. Christmas be busy!\n\n**ilaughatpoliticians**\nYeah it be!  Great to hear. Thank you for the update. Merry Christmas and sleep well. Tomorrow is going to be....interesting.\n\n--------\n\n**Occhrome**\nexactly how did you find out that this was dynamite? who knew this whole time and just kinda forgot about it?\n\n\n**StarSlayerX**\nThere an old family joke that Great Grandpa stored his dynamite in an onion sack... I opened the old shed, saw a mesh sack with old cylindrical tubes in it... Knew right away I am fucked.\n\nIt was in his shed next to his house 15 feet away where I live now.\n\n--------\n\n---------\nOn the dangers of:\n\n**sottedlayabout**\nIt’s been sweating nitro-glycerin for a while. That’s a job for the bomb squad.\n\n**JerkinJosh**\nSo it would just explode if moved wrong?\n\nEdit: for everyone asking I have seen lost. lol\n\n**sottedlayabout**\nIt’s a highly volatile touch sensitive high explosive. If you want to move a bag filled with 4 sticks of sweaty 40 year old dynamite with your own hands I’m not going to stop you but I am going to move to a minimum safe distance. I suggest you don’t drop it or bump into anything with it.\n\n**JerkinJosh**\nWould gently setting the bag down be enough to set it off?\n\n**sottedlayabout**\nIf you’re lucky, no. If you’re unlucky there won’t be enough left to identify.\n\nNitroglycerin explosions were a regular occurrence in both the manufacturing and transportation processes where the nitroglycerin was still chemically stable. The historical record is full of incidents. The stuff that sweats of of dynamite is a different animal entirely.\n\n-------\n\n[**UPDATES 1 - 4**](https://www.reddit.com/r/OSHA/comments/18q9lkq/this_is_how_my_great_grandpa_stored_his_dynomite/kf058ki/) - Dec 26, 2023\n\nUpdate 1:- Called the Police Department and reached dispatch.

He was the best guy for the incident.\n\n------\n\n**Tiny_Count4239**\nthey burned it?\n\n**StarSlayerX**\nYes they had to soak it in diesel then burn it.\n\n**Putin_inyoFace**\nWhat’s up with the diesel fuel? Why did they use that?\n\n**ngwoo**\nstabilizes the nitroglycerine\n\n--------\n\n**ManifestDestinysChld**\nThank you for the update! This is great stuff. I'm glad great-grandpa's shed didn't go off on you. Props to the responders for taking care of that.\n\nDid they say anything about how serious this was? Were they casual about it, or shitting bricks (like I would be, lol)?\n\n**StarSlayerX**\nPretty casual, they mentioned they seen a lot worse.\n\n------\n\n**Omnicide103**\nSilly question probably, but why is the guy cutting it down barely wearing any protective gear? Is this an \"if that blows up in your face no EOD suit is going to save you\" situation?\n\n**StarSlayerX**\nI asked them same thing. They do not carry the full bomb suit in their truck with them. Also they determined that the working space is too crowded and the suit hinder their movement and flexibility.\n\n------\n\n**PikaGaijin**\nOne question (well, I had two -- but, someone already asked about the earth-shattering kaboom). Are you absolutely sure that he only had the single stash?\n\n**StarSlayerX**\nThe funny thing is Great Grandpa has a larger shed further out in the property... so chances are potentially more dynamite. I never went into that shed before and never needed to.\n\n**PikaGaijin**\nYeah, he probably only kept those five sticks close by for an emergency then. The real stuff is out back! :-D\n\n**flammenschwein**\nHaha, didn't ask the bomb squad to take a look while they were out there?\n\n**StarSlayerX**\nNah, honestly it was a long day. No one goes out to that shed and is a bit ways off.\n\n--------\n\n**natlovesmariahcarey**\nSo... who pays for this?\n\n**StarSlayerX**\nTaxpayers\n\n**natlovesmariahcarey**\nWell that's good that grandpa didn't saddle you with MORE than spicy dynamite.\n\nThanks for the update!\n\n--------\n\n**[deleted]**\n[deleted]\n\n**StarSlayerX**\nBecause one bad movement and it become a urn funeral.\n\n**tendrilicon**\nDid ur grandpa not move it around or use it at all?\n\n**StarSlayerX**\nGreat Grandpa used it to make the crawlspace underneath the house. Also other farming tasks... Not sure, long time ago.\n\n-------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Reminder - I am not the original poster.**",

    "body": "Welcome back, friends! Yesterday, I posted about [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and today I wanted to pop in with Moisturizers. There's some imagery that this post does well with, which Reddit doesn't lend itself to, but [here is the primary image you'll want to keep in mind for this post](https://skinolog.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/stratumcorneumtoplayerofskingraph.png). \n\nLet's get started.\n\n---\n\n**An Introduction to Moisturizers**\n\n\"Moisturizer\" is a bit of a vague marketing term. Moisturizers do not necessarily add moisture to the skin as much as they reduce or slow the amount of water that skin loses. They're important to everyone who cleanses their skin, whether with water or a cleanser, but even more critical for those with conditions that cause the skin to lose moisture more easily, such as eczema. In short, moisturizers provide a barrier against moisture loss by creating a soothing, protective film.\n\nBut let's slow down a little. Why does the skin lose moisture in the first place, and where does it even get moisture? To answer this, I present to you a helpful diagram of the skin's epidermis.\n\n[LAYERS OF THE SKIN - IMAGE](https://skinolog.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/epidermal_layers.png?w=318&h=462)\n\nYou may remember from Health or Biology class that skin is generally broken into three major layers: Epidermis (or the upper most layer -- what we can see with our eyes), the dermis (the middle layer -- where most of the nerve endings, oil glands, hair follicles, blood vessels, and collagen hang out), and the hypodermis or the subcutaneous layer (where our fat lives).\n\nAs with onions, there are layers inside of layers, but we will be focusing on the layers of the epidermis, particularly the stratum corneum.\n\nThe epidermis is composed of thousands of cells known as keratinocytes. They begin life deep in the stratum basale, where they slowly make their way upwards, propelled by the growth of new cells below. As these cells get closer to the surface, they flatten down, harden, die, and eventually flake away. Some skin does this well, some not so well (dry skin, acne skin, etc.).\n\nThis process is generally referred to as skin cell turnover, and as we get older, this process gets slower and slower. In children, this only takes about two weeks, and in teens it is three to four weeks. Once you're into your adult years, this slows down to a month, and by the time you're over 50, it's closer to 45 to 90 days.\n\nNowadays, we have ingredients that can speed this process up when applied topically, but that's another post for another time.\n\nThe water that keeps these skin cells happy and healthy comes from deep within the epidermal layers and works its way upwards, until it is eventually lost to evaporation, but just like any organ of the body, it functions best with moisture. When skin is broken or it's natural processes disrupted by wounds, burns, exposure to surfactants (cleansers), or extreme dryness (winter), it loses water quicker. That's why doctors tell you to keep wounds moist and covered and you feel the desire to use richer moisturizers in the winter. When you keep even the upper most layers of the skin hydrated, the cells aid in elasticity and the enzymes within the skin are able to function more efficiently.\n\nIn short, moisturizing helps to repair the skin, increases water content, reduces trans-epidermal water loss (water evaporating out of the skin), and maintains the appearance of the skin. They do this by acting as humectants, occlusives, emollients, and rejuvenators.\n\n**Occlusives**\n\nOcclusive is a fancy word for a sealant -- a compound that is generally hydrophobic and prevents water from evaporating.\n\nThey're not typically very appealing because they can feel heavy or greasy, but they are the most effective ingredient at reducing trans-epidermal water loss. This property makes them particularly effective when used immediately after a shower or cleansing, while the skin is damp.\n\nThe most effective occlusive agent is petrolatum -- a bland little ingredient with a bad reputation. It is the most commonly used ingredient in skin care and reduces water loss by 99%. It's able to initiate production of lipids by penetrating into the upper layers of the stratum corneum (\"sealing the cracks\" in the skin, so to speak), and can reduce the appearance of fine lines and dryness caused by dehydration.\n\nThe second most common ingredient is dimethicone, though it is permeable to water vapor, which makes it less ideal for compromised or damaged skin.\n\nOcclusives, when used alone in a skin care routine, are the last step. I personally apply a touch of Vaseline on the driest parts of my face after applying moisturizers and prescription medications.\n\nOther common types of occlusives include squalene, paraffin, lanolin, cetyl alcohol, beeswax, and cholesterol.\n\n**Humectants**\n\nHumectants are kind of like the hydrators of skin care ingredients. They're hydroscopic, meaning they are able to attract and hold onto water molecules. However, due to their water-loving way, they can pull water away from the dermis and cause excessive water loss. This is why humectants are almost always combined with occlusives, like petrolatum.\n\nThe most common humectants are glycerin or glycerol and hyaluronic acid, but there are also hydroxy acids (another post, another time), propylene glycol, and urea.\n\n**Emollients**\n\nEmollients are the ingredients that serve the primary function of filling in the cracks between skin cells. Many times, occlusives can be used and function as emollients. These ingredients are what make your skin feel soft after applying a moisturizer, and are commonly natural oils like rosehip seed oil.\n\nWhile simple, these ingredients can assist in the inflammatory response of the skin, and are very individual. For example, you may notice that your skin seems to act better when you use rosehip seed oil, thanks to the linoleic acid (an omega 6) within the oil.\n\n**Rejuvenators**\n\nRejuvenators replenish the proteins in skin, and include ingredients such as collagen, keratin, and elastin. These ingredients have limited permeability due to their large molecular size, but they can fill a similar role as emollients, filling in fine lines and smoothing the skin.\n\n---\n\n**A Note on Ceramides**\n\nCeramides are a fairly new(ish) breakthrough in cosmeceuticals. They're naturally found in the lipids of the skin, and help to maintain the skin barrier (the function of the skin that holds onto moisture and keeps out unwanted chemicals). In a 1990 study, \"it was found that the level of ceramides was greatly reduced in the stratum corneum in patients with atopic dermatis. It was subsequently concluded that an insufficiency of ceramides in the stratum corneum is an important factor in atopic dry skin. Subsequently, ceramides have been added to many moisturizes used in the treatment of both atopic and normal skin.\" [1]\n\nYou can find ceramides starring in many creams and lotions now, and even at your local drugstore in brands like CeraVe.\n\n**All Tied Together**\n\nWhen I first began resolving my own skin issues, the greatest barrier (and what finally solved my acne) was finding a moisturizer that worked for me. I have several sensitivities and am unable to use a handful of common ingredients as well as a large number of uncommon ingredients. Skin needs are unique and individual in this way. You may find that you need to try many products to find what works best for you, but here are some guidelines to get you started.\n\n* **Look for simple ingredient lists.** Ingredient lists proven by the science are the best kind. Try to find something without fragrance, essential oils, and if you have particularly sensitive skin, without natural nut or plant oils, such as jojoba, rosehip, marula, or almond oil. This also makes it easier to rule out what causes your skin problems, so you aren't fluttering from one product with an exhaustively long ingredient list to another, just hoping.\n* **Use an occlusive on your driest parts.** Vaseline (brand name for petrolatum) is one of the most bland products on the market, and is comprised of one of the most boring molecules around. It is incredibly non-reactive and well-tolerated. Pat it on after a shower, after your moisturizer, on damp skin.\n* **Moist skin heals best.** Keep cuts, scrapes, and scratches under a bandage with a glob of Vaseline. Same for acne spots with an open wound. Moist skin also scars less.\n* **Seek out ceramides.** These crown jewels are amazing for all skin types, but especially skin that is dry or acne-prone.\n* **Don't be afraid of moisture if you have acne.** Many times, we fear moisture and oil as the cause of acne, but as I'll start to explain, skin that is prone to acne tends to lack a lot of the moisture and good fats that keep it healthy.\n* **Hydrated skin absorbs ingredients better.** Remember when I said that skin that is hydrated functions more efficiently? Skin that is hydrated also uses other ingredients more efficiently. This means that you may experience more irritation from topical prescriptions like tretinoin/retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, LHAs, etc. Simply back down on how much you use of these products and celebrate -- your skin is healthy!\n* **Use a humidifier if it's dry in your home.** I have a simple digital humidity gauge in my bedroom so I can track the humidity of the room at any given time. Ideal humidity levels are between 40-60%. When humidity levels dip below this, such as in the winter when the heat is running frequently, I use a humidifier to boost the humidity levels. This is fantastic for your skin and prevents humectants from \"pulling\" too much moisture out of the deeper layers of your skin.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n\n* [Nolan, K. and Marmur, E.

I only make this point because I have dehydrated skin, and so I try to think about the humidity outside as well, and try to take preemptive measures (like a thicker day cream) if I see it’s dry out, but the humidity from the weather report is misleading!\n\nWhen you check the weather report, the humidity it gives you is “relative humidity.” This measure of humidity doesn’t tell you how much water is in the air, it tells you how much water is in the air compared to how much water the air can hold at its current temperature. Air can hold more water when the temperature is higher. When it’s cold out, the air can hold less water. \n\nFor example, there is less water in the air when it’s 100 percent humidity and it’s 0 deg C (32 deg F) outside than when it’s 50 percent humidity and 27 deg C (80 deg F)\n\nI think dew point is a better measure if you want to know much moisture is in the air, or how wet outside it feels. When there is a lot of water in the air, it will start to condense out (dew) at higher temperatures. So the higher the dew point, the more water is in the air and the more humid it actually is, and therefore the easier it is for water to be accessed by the skin. \n\nI have no idea at what dew point skin is happiest though. Generally they say a dew point of 30 or below is when your skin will get dry and cracked. If you have oily skin you probably will prefer dew points 50 or below. They say people start feeling it’s humid and a bit sticky at around 60. For me, I have a high tolerance for humidity discomfort, and since my skin is dehydrated i tend to prefer it when the dew point is at least 60 or higher.\n\nI grew up in a humid place but now live in a dry place, and it’s amazing to me how I look 10 years younger, my fine lines disappear, my skin looks clearer, and I stop itching everywhere almost immediately whenever I visit home.",

I've got a follow-up question - most directly relating to the rejuvenators and ceramides.\n\nI have this general suspicion about health products, that just because an ingredient is \"good for you\" doesn't mean that the method of delivery is at all effective. As a non-skin related example, turmeric has some chemicals in it that are great for brain health, but they don't cross the blood-brain barrier so eating turmeric really doesn't do your brain any good.\n\nSo when I read that things like ceramide and collagen are present in healthy skin/missing from unhealthy skin, I'm not sure whether that means applying a product containing those ingredients is actually going to deliver them to my skin tissue in a way that is beneficial.\n\nIs there reasonable evidence that application through a topical moisturizer is an effective way to deliver things like ceramides, collagen, keratin and elastin to the skin? Or is it possible they just sit on top of the skin and don't do all that much? Are there certain types of products that are more effective at delivering them (e.g. a water-based product vs. oil-based)?",

    "body": "Hey everyone! Due to a recent posting of misinformation being spread on here, excessive worrying over ingredients, and people PMing me for advice I figured I would just make a post about this to help other people with similar questions\n\nFor background, I am a chemist- in particular a biochemist. I used to work in a research area that focused on mineral/ion- skin absorption. I'll try to hit the ones that aren't in the side bar already and separate them out by category for easy viewing. Let me know if I missed any big ones!\n\n**Emulsifiers - keep oil/water based chemicals from separating in products**\n\nMost common products I see contain polysorbates, laureth-4, glyceryl monostearate (also pearlescent agent)\nlauramide DEA (also foam booster), or potassium cetyl sulfate. There's also stearic acid that also helps with cleansing. These aren't necessarily bad for you nor are they good for you. They're kinda meh ingredients that exist to make the product work \n\n**Preservatives- extend their shelf life and are anti microbial**\n \nparabens- these get a lot of flack but there isn't that much research confirming their 'toxicity'. The [original study] (http://www.dr-baumann.ca/science/Concentrations%20of%20Parabens%20in%20Human%20Breast.pdf) that brought them into the spotlight was over hyped by the media and dozens of other studies done afterwards have yet to find a definite link to cancer or other diseases. These are however very great preservatives\n\nBenzyl alcohol containing products has been known to dry some people out due to it's status as an alcohol. Aside from a preservative it's also used as a ph balancer\n\nformaldehyde- if you see this in a product, you may want to be wary. The World Health Organization has determined this to be a carcinogen; however whether trace amounts are as bad for you is still unknown\n\n tetrasodium EDTA/ disodium EDTA- normally these are used to draw metals out of the blood, but in terms of skincare, both work to stabilize the product by binding other chemicals. Only concern with this one is that it's an environmental hazard \n\nPhenoxyethanol -  an antimicrobial \n\nethylhexylglycerin - helps with eczema and also works for some people with rosacea \n\n**Moisturizers : Lipid thickeners - give product it's creamy consistency**\n\ncetyl alcohol, stearic acid and carnauba wax are the big ones- aren't bad, rarely cause things like breakouts for most people. These are also good at protecting the moisture barrier from water loss by forming a 'seal' \n\n**Moisturizers : Natural thickeners - come from nature, usually work as humectants (think hyaluronic acid)**\n\nhydroxyethyl cellulose, guar gum, xanthan gum and gelatin are the most popular\n\n**Moisturizers: Mineral thickeners - also natural, absorb both oils and retain water**\n\nmagnesium aluminium silicate, silica and bentonite are the big ones here. A lot of clay masks and some silicone based (neutrogena) sunscreens are apart of this category. Silicone based sunscreens are great for those who's skin can handle them since they keep oils/shine in check while also preventing your skin from overdrying\n\n**Moisturizers: synthetic thickeners - used in a lot of gel type products and some of the rich/smooth white creams**\n\ncarbomer, cetyl palmitate, and ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate are common ones\n\n**Emollients - soften the skin by preventing water loss, work as humectants,  definetly want these in your routine**\n\nbeeswax, olive oil, coconut oil and lanolin, petroleum jelly, mineral oil, glycerin, zinc oxide, butyl stearate and diglycol laurate , urea, glycerol, propylene glycol or lactic acid are big ones here.\n\nSome of these are termed 'comedogenic' like coconut oil but many many people don't break out from them so that's a pretty arbitrary rating imo\n\n**Edit- here’s a couple more I forgot to add that are sunscreen relevant**\n\n**Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate-** protects against UVB and not UVA rays. It is not very stable either, when exposed to sunlight, it kind of breaks down and loses its effectiveness (not instantly, but over time - it loses 10% of its SPF protection ability within 35 mins)\n\n**Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane-**  famous Avobenzone. It is the only globally available chemical sunscreen agent that protects against UVA. It is the global gold standard of UVA protection and is the most used UVA sunscreen in the world. Suprisingly it’s in moisturizers too.The problem with it, though, is that it is not photostable and degrades in the sunlight. Wikipedia says that avobenzone loses 36% of its UV-absorption capacity after just one hour of sunlight",

    "body": "Preface: I'm a cis woman and I after a postop trans woman friend recently asked me some of these, I thought I should compile - her doctor did not go over most of these with her. Maybe it was just her but I've got a lot of time on my hands now #pandemic and I thought I should share some tips since I've been taking very good care of mine (I've had the same gyno my whole adult life) and people who go down on me always compliment it haha ok here it goes! \\[new edits for clarification and with generous notes from commenters\\]\n\n1. Wash your vulva at least every other day, but ideally daily! I just squat in the shower while I brush my teeth in the am and splash myself with warm water and a lil bit of soap. If if your vulva has folds / labia / clitoral hood, make sure you're moving the skin off to the side / parting it and getting soapy water in those areas and then rinse rinse rinse! \\[edit: YMMV with washing the folds / mucous parts of the vulva\\]\n2. On soap! Unscented liquid soap is best! Bar soap by default tends to leave some residue behind which can dry / irritate the area. There's plenty of unscented liquid soaps in whatever shops you go to, looking for labels like \"baby mild\" \"soap free\" \"sensitive skin\" are also helpful. And if you're washing daily, you can for sure partition out your soap into two bottles then mix it with distilled water to dilute it. For this reason I don't do bath bombs or bubble baths (besides with my unscented liquid soap). Even salt soaks for muscle aches I do very sparingly. \\[edit: YMMV may vary with soaps! This is just what \\*I\\* use that works\\]\n3. Underpants! This is gonna be multi part: a) change your underpants daily! And at night it's best to let it air out so there's lots of options for that - no panties, sleeping with baggy pj bottoms... But if you're going to sleep with panties on, ideal to use new ones than the one you spent all day in. b) panties need to be 100% cotton for breathability! I know super cute panties come in synthetic materials or even silk, but those materials don't breathe very well. Cute for a date but not the best for your vulva to spend ALL DAY in. Same for thongs, not a whole day thing. Material EXCEPTION is for hiking specific / sport panties - those are made with special wicking materials and I love to wear those on super humid / hot days when I wanna also wear tight fitting bottoms (hey skinny jeans!). \\[edit: Synthetic panties that are specifically moisture-wicking are 100% ok to use regularly\\]\n4. \"Hygiene products\": I put that in quotes cuz they're not good for you! Those products only mess up the natural pH and bacterial flora of your genitals which makes you more susceptible to yeast infections. I read an excerpt of a study that neo-vaginas get yeast infections at about the same rate as cis-vaginas. You shouldn't need to use any special wipes, rinses, sprays etc UNLESS you have something off going on and your hopefully trans-competent gyno tells you that you need to use X product for Y amount of time. But regular vulva / vagina care shouldn't include those things. And unless there's some temporary discharge involved, panty liners don't breathe and shouldn't be used as a substitute for fresh panties.\n5. Laundry! Related to soap, you should only be washing your delicates in unscented laundry detergent otherwise you're going to end up with residue in your panties which will get absorbed by your vulva. If you drop off your laundry to get it done then maybe just hand wash your panties (make sure to triple rinse if hand washing) and let them dry in the sun. Laundry detergent is a huge culprit in vulva problems. Oh and for the same reason don't use dryer sheets / fabric softener with your panties.\n6. LUBE! if you haven't gotten the theme yet... your lube should also be unscented / unflavored / dye free / fragrance free, BUT ALSO ideally paraben free (very irritating preservative) and pH balanced to about 4.1 – 4.4 pH. I like to get a small bottle of lube, even if I have to buy it often, because then the amount that cross-contamination / deterioration from air / expiration affects it is less of an issue. \\[edit: coconut oil is safe to use too! And glycerin works for some people though I prefer glycerin-free\\]\n7. Receiving penetrative sex! If you're having someone(s) put fingers / phallus / toys / etc yolo in your vagina, the best way to take care of your very important urethral opening (which is now inside your body) is to PEE! Yes i know it's not very sexy to be cuddling your boo(s) after sex and having to excuse yourself to go pee but that's honestly the best way to clear out anything that could've gotten in there. And obviously wash thoroughly anything you're putting inside your vagina both before and after with unscented soap! \\[edit: talk with your doctor in regards to douching, not necessary for cis-vaginas post sex but I cannot speak for neo-vaginas wether this is/is not needed\\]\n\nThe end! I don't mean to come in here with my cis-ness and tell y'all how to live your lives / take care of your bodies, I just wanted to impart the same knowledge that I had to recently share  because I figured if these tips were helpful to her, they might be helpful to someone else too. I'll go back to my lane now and sorry for intruding in your space <3\n\n\\[edit\\] Please let me know if you have any more questions about anything mentioned here, happy to answer!\n\nP.s. English is not my main language so if I write something that isn't clear / comes off as offensive, I would be very grateful + appreciative for a comment or message explanation (but no one obviously needs to take the mental energy to correct me, if I mess up that's on me). Big thank you for everyone that's already corrected me and expanded on my tips <3",

No cis friends, no trans friends (I was the first of my trans friends to get surgery), no doctors. And especially considering I'd never seen a cis-woman's vagina outside of internet porn images, and I was 28 when I got surgery lol. I ended up getting a UTI about 4 months in because I wasn't properly cleaning things. The only things I knew from beforehand was to use odorless, water-based products and to never use \"Hygiene products\".\n\nThe only way I found out best practices was via /r/badwomensanatomy, which had a couple of threads related to other adult women who had no idea how to keep things clean, so their ignorance was my blessing in this case!\n\nSo thank you, this is very useful information and I'll make sure to pass it along to other trans women who plan on getting surgery, as I'm sure they will love this.\n\nOne last thing I want to add to your post, if you'll have it that is:\n\n**Do not clean inside your vagina**. It seriously messes with the good bacteria you have in there.  \n**HOWEVER** in the beginning, right after surgery for the first few months (or however long your doctor suggests); you **should** use the solution they provide to douche your vagina, about once a week or once every other week depending on your doctor. This is due to all of the bad stuff that happens right after surgery, with blood and stuff leaking out into the inside area that you'll want to flush away.  \nSome people also suggest douching after sex, but this isn't necessarily required and you should only do so if you feel you need to.",

This can lead to a nasty UTI very quickly. Please keep everything clean down there when tucking, and don't do it for extended periods of time if you can help it.\n\nAlso when doing any sort of anal play with a penis, be sure to clean clean clean afterwards. Most people do it automatically anyway because residue from back there is quite unpleasantly smelly, but there are some people who dont care.

        "body": "Another cis woman here.  OP, the vast majority of your advice is spot on! This is a good guide for anyone with a vagina.  However, a couple things jumped out at me that I want to bring up.\n\nThe first one is your suggestion of using soap to clean the vulva.  You shouldn’t use soap on a mucous membranes, which includes the space between the labia majora and labia minora.  The very exterior (where the skin feels the same as the skin on your leg) is fine, but any mucous membranes should not be washed with soap.  It has the potential to throw off the pH level of the area and lead to infection.  You suggest a “mild” soap but even mild soaps like baby soap (usually around a pH of 7)have a pH level that is *much* more alkaline ( than normal skin (pH ~5.5), and more so than an acidic area like the vulva and vagina (pH ~4)  So soap is generally not recommended.  Unscented washes like Summers Eve or Vagisil, which are specifically adjusted to the appropriate pH for the area, could be used, but generally the external genitalia only need washed with water.  This is superseded, of course, by the instructions given by a surgeon for someone that has had GCS.  Though even then, unscented products are best.  \n\nFurther down in the comments you also advocated against using coconut oil, reasoning that sugars in coconut oil can lead to infections.  100% cold-pressed or fractionated coconut oil is solely a lipid, and does not contain sugars of any kind.  It can absolutely be used as a lubricant inside and outside the vagina, without fear of a yeasty beastie.  Care should be taken to ensure the coconut oil you use is nothing but coconut oil and is filtered to remove any bits of coconut meat.  Any other non-fragrant carrier oil, such as apricot kernel, grape seed, jojoba, or others, can be used in its place if filtered coconut oil is unavailable.  Avoid using essential oils like the plague.  (Some lubricants contain peppermint oil, and on unbroken skin that is okay, but I don’t recommend making minty lube unless you are well versed with cosmetic chemistry.)",

Cis-women, **especially** cis-women dropping knowledge bombs of this yield, are absolutely welcome here.\n\nA few amplifications, questions, etc.:\n\n1. The whole cleaning between the folds part, I would imagine, should largely be identical to standard hygienic practice for penis care. Gotta clean under the foreskin, or bad things happen. If you're taking proper care in your genital cleaning before SRS, it should be able to spill over to proper cleaning after.\n\n3. I personally prefer to sleep au naturale, which obviates the issue of sleeping in panties, but of course, nightgowns would do the same. I also prefer to towel off after a shower, but then lay on my bed spread-eagle in the A.C./furnace dried air under a ceiling fan to finish air-drying before putting on any clothes. Do you have any wisdom regarding this practice?\n\n4. THIS! Douching, etc. is not a standard/regular part of feminine hygiene. I don't know why more vagina-havers don't know this. It's remedial care to remedy imbalanced vaginal biota and pH, but also **causes** such imbalances with persistent use.\n\n6. Glycerol is a sugar alcohol, as you say, but that makes it an alcohol, not a sugar. Glycerol, is actually a waste-product of yeast-based fermentation not a feed stock, and as all alcohols, has anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties. I strongly suspect that UTIs stemming from use of products which contain glycerol (syn. glycerin(e)) were not as a result of the use of glycerol, but inspite of it, and actually stem from other ingredients, like the artificial colors, flavors, and fragrances.\n\nThe only source I could find discussing glycerol-containing products and UTIs/yeast infections only claimed that they tended to exacerbate (but not certainly cause) them in women already susceptible to UTIs and yeast infections. In other words, no correlation could be found in women with pre-existing good vaginal biota and pH for glycerol-containing products to cause an imbalance of vaginal biota or pH which could then lead to UTIs or yeast infections.\n\nI checked my bathroom, and every body wash contains glycerin on the label, but my shampoos and conditioners didn't. Glycerol is also a common ingredient in most lubes, including \"water-based\" lubes.\n\n7. Peeing after sex is actually recommended regardless of wedding tackle, just that for some reason, it's not promoted to penis-havers nearly as much as to vagina-havers. I have no idea why.\n\nWhat is your advice regarding using body poofs and loofahs?\n\nWhat is your advice regarding using baby oil on or near the vulva?\n\nI once jokingly claimed that a method for establishing good vaginal biota for someone recovered from SRS would be the sex practice of scissoring with a vagina-haver who already has a health vagina.

    "body": "I've copy/pasted this text multiple times now and decided to just make a separate post about it (and I admit I want to be lazy and just post a link instead of repeatedly copy/pasting a comment). Some of you may recognize a good portion of this, but I've added some points because I'm trying to make this post as comprehensive as possible.\n\nIn order to determine whether a product is water-based or silicone-based, you have to look at the ingredients. -Cone/-methicone, and -siloxane words near the top of the list tend to signal a silicone-based product. Water will be at the top of the list for any liquid product because water makes it liquidy. It doesn't mean that a product is water-based. Without water, the product would not be spreadable/blendable. For example:\n\nMAKE UP FOR EVER HD Microperfecting Primer Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Aqua (Water), **Dimethicone**, **Trisiloxane**, PEG-12 **Dimethicone**, **Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone** Crosspolymer, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Squalane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18 Methicone, Phenoxyethanol, Ceteth-10, Laureth-4, Ethylglycerin, Panthenol, Potassium Sorbate, Polysorbate 60, Parfum (Fragrance), Argania Spinosa Extract (Argania Spinosa Kernel Extract), C12-14 Pareth-12, Hydrolyzed Algin, Dodecene, Sorbitan Isostearate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Tromethamine, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. [CI 19140 (Yellow 5 Lake), CI 75470 (Carmine), CI 77007 (Ultramarines), CI 77288 (Chromium Oxide Greens), CI 77289 (Chromium Hydroxide Green), CI 77491 (Iron Oxides), CI 77492 (Iron Oxides), CI 77499 (Iron Oxides), CI 77742 (Manganese Violet), CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide)].\n\nSee the bold words? Definitely silicone-based! Again, the water keeps it a more liquid-y consistency so it's easily spreadable. It doesn't mean that the product is water-based. Particularly with primers, I can always tell because it has that \"silicone\" feeling. Now let's look at a water-based primer:\n\nLaura Mercier Foundation Primer - Oil Free Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Isodecyl Isononanoate, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, C22-20 Alcohols, Squalane, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Esters, Phenoxyethanol, Boron Nitride, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin Tocopherol Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hamaelis Viginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Cucumis sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Retinyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Polyamino Sugar Condesate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Chlorphensin, Benzoic Acid, Polysorbate 60, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Saccharomyces/Xylium Black Tea Ferment, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Potassium Sorbate, Green 5 (CI 61570), Yellow 5 (CI 19140).\n\nSee how there are no -cone/-methicone or -siloxane words near the top of the list? That means that it's water-based. This primer does contain dimethicone, which is a silicone, but it's relatively low on the list, which means that it contains a very small amount of silicone (ingredients are typically listed in order, beginning with what is in there most and ending with what is in there the least). Thus, because this primer contains much more water (and other ingredients) than silicone, it is water-based.\n\nOil-based foundations are exceptionally rare. After much searching, I finally found one: Alexandra de Markoff Countess Isserlyn Cream Makeup (another is NARS Balanced Foundation, which has been discontinued, so I could not find an easily copy/paste-able ingredients list). Let's look at the ingredients:\n\nWater (aqua), **Decyl Oleate**, **Lanolin Oil**, Propylene Glycol, Talc, Isotearic Acid, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetyl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Fragrance (parfum), Emulsifying Wax NF, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, PPG-12-PEG-65 Lanolin Oil, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben. May contain Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI77492, CI 77499, Ultramarines (CI77007)\n\nYes, water is listed as the first ingredient, but that is to keep the product more blendable. The second and third ingredients (in bold) are definitely oils. Phew! You don't know how many ingredients lists I went through to find that! I swear unicorns are easier to find! ANYWAY, they should play well with silicone-based primers. However, this is unlikely to be of concern to you because chances are you're not using an oil-based foundation (if you are using an oil-based foundation, check your closet for a herd of unicorns).\n\nIn general, you want water-based primers with water-based foundations (or tinted moisturizers, BB creams, CC creams, concealer, or any other base products; I'm just going to keep typing \"foundations\" for the sake of brevity), and silicone-based primers with silicone-based foundations. The two different bases (water and silicone) can cause your foundation to pill when layered on top of each other. In particular, using a silicone-based primer with a water-based foundation on top of it often causes the foundation to pill because the primer creates a silicone barrier. When you try to apply a water-based foundation on top of that, the silicone repels the water in the foundation, and the water in the foundation does not absorb properly into your skin, resulting in unevenness.\n\nPlease remember to moisturize well underneath your makeup (and to give your moisturizer time to absorb fully, meaning your skin should no longer have that \"tacky\" feeling that you have right after applying moisturizer). If you use sunscreen (which you should, especially with summer coming up), you need to let that absorb as well. The base of your moisturizer/sunscreen is irrelevant, because if you allow them to absorb completely, they will not affect makeup application at all. If you begin applying primer and foundation before your moisturizer and/or sunscreen has fully absorbed, they can cause your makeup to break up sooner, which is the opposite of what you want.\n\nAlong the same line, your powder is irrelevant to the base of your foundation/primer. There is no such thing as a water-based powder (it then wouldn't be a powder). If your powder isn't working with your foundation/primer and giving you the look that you want, it is not related to the base of your foundation/primer. Also, not everybody needs to use powder on top of their foundation, so if you're not liking the look, you may consider skipping powder altogether.\n\nAdditionally, you only need a small amount of primer for your face (a very thin layer is sufficient... your face should not feel too slippery). Do not apply too much primer. Water-based primers will absorb into your skin better, but silicone-based primers tend to sit on top of it. Using too much will create a slick film that causes your foundation to slide off much sooner. Remember that it is easier to add more (and I recommend that you add more gradually, little by little) than to take primer off of your face. Over time, you'll get used to the amount you need for your face.\n\nWhile pore-filling primers, such as Benefit Porefessional, NYX Pore Filler, and Too Faced Primed and Poreless, are designed specifically to fill in your visible pores, you can also use any primer to do this (though in my experience, they do not do as well at filling in pores as pore-filling primers, and silicone-based primers work best for filling in pores). Just make sure that you tap the primer into your pores rather than rubbing. Tapping gets the product into your pores to fill them in. Rubbing does not do the same (though you can rub afterward to make sure the surface is smoothed out) and will not give you the same pore-filling results.\n\nFinally, please remember that just because you are using two products with the same base, it doesn't necessarily mean that the products will work for you. Not every product works for every person. You may need to experiment to find the right combination for you. I highly recommend asking for samples, as they are a much cheaper (i.e. FREE) method of trying out a product. You can ask for samples of any product that can be sanitized and put in a small sample jar, such as primer and foundation.\n\nI hope this post has been helpful.

THC is the same way, but creates a much more intense high, helps with chronic pain, and is less addictive. Alcohol, we drink because it lowers our inhibitions and makes us feel goofy and playful. Caffeine - also we drink it,  it's a stimulant for us. Most of us have a cup full every morning, and several more through the day. Diphenhydramine helps us sleep in small doses, but is an absolutely horrifying, nightmare inducing hallucinogenic in large doses. But other than that, harmless. We give it to infants. Setraline - dude was depressed, probably from being out here so long, it happens when we don't get enough real sunlight. Barbiturates, they're powerful depressants, they can help stop seizures. So can THC, actually. Oh. Okay so it was medical. Damn.\n\nAnyways, so, basically this dude smoked, drank, was a bit depressed, couldn't sleep, and had epilepsy, maybe PTSD, that's all.

    "body": "Alright y’all before you bring out the pitchforks, hear me out. I am a cosmetology student with 750 hours under my belt, and I do frequent research on curly haircare that is backed in sound cosmetology science, not guesses and fads. I too subscribed to CGM early in my curl journey. I will add photos of my hair on CGM (for a long time, so I wasn’t transitioning anymore) and my hair now. If you think CGM “works” for you, great. It’s your head do what you want. But if you’re looking for hydrated curls, no itchy scalp (unless you have a skin condition), long lasting styles, and better scalp hygiene, keep reading. Anyway, let’s break it down. \n\nCGM as a specific method by Lorraine Massey generally only specifies a couple things, so I’m also going to talk about curly influencer trends in general as well. \n\nPrinciple One: Cowashing *instead* of shampoo\nNo. Please. There are a few select cowashes that do contain cleansing agents (such as the doux one love cowash) that can be used between shampoos if you just want to restyle your hair. But it is not a shampoo, and should never replace shampoo. Even with clarifying once a month, cowash is not enough, especially not with the volume and number of products that these methods say that you must have and use. Generally, I recommend using a gentle shampoo for washes during the week, and a clarifying and/or chelating shampoo as needed. I would use a cowash say, right after a semi permanent dye application, or anything where cleansing would alter your color. Otherwise? Not needed. Just Shampoo. We’ve come a long way from the head and shoulders shampoos that were infamous for stripping all life from curls. I can’t exactly give product recs without a thorough consultation at minimum, but look for shampoos with lower SLS concentration or other cleansing agents in higher concentration, ample hydrators (like glycerin and fatty alcohols), and oils low on the ingredients list (I’ll talk about oils later). For clarifying shampoos, look for the word clarifying and expect the squeaky clean feeling. A well formulated one will not cause tangles. \n\nPrinciple 2: So Many Products \nListen to me. I don’t care how tight or loose your curls are. You need maybe 3 products for styling at maximum, for most you need 1-2. What hair needs is water and hold to keep the water in (it will evaporate and it should. You don’t want waterproof hair). Style soaking wet and use a botanical gel or foam (think kinky curly custard and foams like the doux mousse def). There is no such thing as adding moisture. Leave ins and creams are useless and countering any natural definition you’d have. All you’re doing is adding lubrication and artificial shine that washes out (unless you’re using cowashes then it’s just clogging your follicles and causing buildup). Not all hair can be reflective without sheen products (like water soluble silicones) and that’s fine. \n\nPrinciple 3: Raw Oils\nPut away the kitchen ingredients. Food cannot absorb into your hair shaft and if it could it would wreck havoc. Oils have no place on your scalp unless they’re prescribed by a dermatologist or trichologist. They build up and over time cause dryness, frizz, lack of curl definition, and scalp issues. This one causes a stir esp in black and brown communities. Hair oiling is often part of our culture, and that’s valid and important, but at least avoid coconut oil (it gets stuck in the hair shaft) and clarify your hair after. \n\nThese are the absolute basics and by no means encompasses all of what I and others know about curls. Feel free to ask questions in good faith.",

Just an example of a personal choice that works for me.\n\nThat being said, you make a lot of good points, especially about the number of products. As another commentor pointed out, cgm (like so many methods and plans and routines) was started as a way to sell products, not for maximum hair health or appearance. Mindless consumption, buying more and more, hour long wash routines, aren't necessary to have hair that you love, and I think that's worth emphasizing",

Silicones literally fix all the issues I have with my curly hair, it makes it more manageable and shinier. I don't understand why people claim that it's supposedly bad for my hair.

        "body": "I have a mix of 4a and 4b hair. I was trying everything the CGM suggests, using different CGM techniques and spending $$$$$ on products to try to find the right routine that would make my hair manageable and show my curls. Part my issue was bc my hair was mostly dead from years of straightening and protective styles, but even then I was having moderate to severe dry scalp issues that not even medicated shampoo from my doctor had fixed. I was struggling with getting my hair to look good in a PONYTAIL, and regardless of what I did my hair felt heavy and gross to the touch. \n\nAfter YEARS of trying and failing with CGM, I finally booked a big chop with a salon that specializes in curly hair and type 4 hair. They taught me so much about curl care for my type of hair and basically agreed with everything you said. \n\nI was skeptical at first but willing to try anything! After clarifying, because I hadn’t done that in god knows when  and was just slapping product after product on my hair,  they said the biggest component to getting your curl pattern to retain its form is WATER. Water is what gives you moisture, so your hair needs to be completely soaked when you wash it. Shampooing is ESSENTIAL. You still want a shampoo without silicones, but shampooing is absolutely necessary for hair and scalp health. My hair was unmanageable before partly because I wasn’t shampooing enough nor as well as I should have been and all that product was adhering itself to my hair and weighing it down, causing the frizz and lack of curls. Shampooing is the most important part. Spend time doing it. If you like to wash your hair more frequently, a gentle shampoo can be used often. If you like to only shampoo once a week or so, then you’ll need a stronger shampoo to really get the dirt and buildup off your hair so you have a clean canvas to style.\n\nAfter conditioning and thoroughly rinsing, while the hair is soaking wet, this is where the styling comes in. OP is right (at least in my case), using only 2 styling products has worked wonders for me. I first use a “gel” that is less of a holding gel and more of a “lock in moisture” type of gel. This is going to help my curls retain their shape because they look best when they’re wet. Then I go over it again with a holding gel and diffuse for ~15 minutes. My curls look insane and my hair feels so lightweight. My scalp hasn’t had a single flake since. \n\nAll I’m saying is, yes, everyone’s hair is different and if CGM has worked for you thus far then by all means continue!! But if you’re on this sub and have tried everything and nothing is working for you, I would definitely think about abandoning CGM and using water based products/shampooing more!!\n\nETA: I use the Innersense color awakening hair bath for shampoo, then I thoroughly rinse. For conditioner I use the Innersense hydrating cream conditioner and I make sure my hair is really wet when I apply it. When I rinse that out I put Uncle Funky’s Daughter on verrrry wet hair and then I put Innersense I Create Hold gel and rake it through with a comb. \n\nThey’re not cheap products by any means but I wash my hair roughly every 3-4 days and I’ve had the same bottles for over a month and still have a lot more to go. A little goes a very long way!",

Other heat free natural hair styles like braid outs, twist outs and bantu knot outs wouldn't get you an after unless the customer came back the next day\n\nThis means that most advice given by natural hair stylists is focused on wash and goes. If I primarily wore my hair in a wash and go then oil disrupts the gel cast required to get that definition. Wash and goes does last as long and need a lot of moisture to set so you need to wash your hair frequently \n\nIt makes perfect sense this way, especially because most looser curly haired people wear their hair in wash and goes\n\nBut in type 4, wash and goes are actually the minority. Most type 4 naturals don't even care that much about seeing individual curl clumps. We want healthy hair, nicely shaped (preferably long for most of us)\n\nI primarily wear my hair in a bun ir a braid out (gives me the biggest fro) I only see my natural curl pattern when washing my hair.\n\nI was focused on getting hair as long as possible. So in that case, oil makes more sense. Protective styling with less frequent hair washing also makes more sense. And it worked! Black women ask me what I do to my hair all the time.  \n\nIf you have a client who wants a wash and go and wants to know how to do great wash and goes at home brilliant! But this advice isn't helpful to the average person with Type 4 hair who just wants longer healthier hair",

        "body": "As far as hair care opinions go, I don't think I have anything to add to this post and comments section that hasn't already been expressed. I want to address something else instead.\n\nOP, at the end of your post, you say \"Feel free to ask questions in good faith.\" That's a great thing to do when you're starting a discussion, especially on a controversial topic! It sets clearer boundaries and also signals that you are open to answering those questions.\n\nThe thing is... I don't think that your OWN words come across as being 'in good faith.'\n\nRead before fighting me.\n\nPhrases like \"If you think \\[xyz\\] 'works' for you\" (paragraph 1), \"So many products\" (paragraph 3), and \"Put away the kitchen ingredients\" (paragraph 4) are specific instances in your post where I noticed that I was feeling a strong negative emotion. That emotion was/is shame.\n\nShame is something that, in my opinion, has no place in most of our day-to-day interactions. Shame especially has no place in teaching. And that last sentence isn't just my opinion, [it's scientific fact.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8768475/) Research studies about everyone from [medical students](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6416111/) to [teachers in training](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10649-021-10141-1) have shown with great consistency that, qualitatively\\* and quantitatively\\*\\*, shame isn't just ineffective in teaching and communicating; it's actively harmful, [even when it makes people more likable/palatable.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22471849/)\n\nBut I don't think you need science to tell you that. Most people have, after all, experienced shame as a teaching technique firsthand through past teachers, 'friends,' and/or 'mentors.' Personally, I stopped pursuing math of any kind, not because I wasn't capable of doing so, but because people shamed me so much for my mistakes that I stopped engaging with the subject. I'm sure many people can relate, lol.\n\nTelling people that their perspectives and experiences are less valid than yours doesn't teach them. It shames them. Telling people that they are doing too much/caring too much/wanting too much doesn't teach them. It shames them.\n\nTo be clear, this isn't me saying that you're a bad person by default (or in general, but philosophical discussions of morality are insane and idcrn, lol) for engaging in this, either intentionally or unintentionally. [Shame is most people's default in many types of situations, especially situations where we're communicating potentially negative information.](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1514699113)\n\nThat said, while intent =/= impact, that doesn't mean the impact isn't real. Regardless of your intent, your post comes across in a way that made me, at the very least, feel bad about myself. If that wasn't your intent, it might be worth investigating why your words didn't say what you intended them to say.\n\nLike many wise people and a plethora of therapists have said, [it's not the thought or the truth that counts. It's what you do with that thought and/or truth once you have it.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/smarts/201303/truth-matters-less-what-you-do-it)\n\nAnd an important addendum-- this doesn't mean that people can't be mad at you. If there are people on this sub that don't want to engage with you again, I would personally find that understandable, especially from people who's lived, empirical experience deviates from the rules you have laid out above.\n\ntl;dr Your post about \"bad\" technique made me feel like I'm a \"bad\" person, and that's not cool.\n\n\\---\n\n\\*Qualitatively: Refers to research done based on things other than numbers (i.e. interviews).\n\n\\*\\* Quantitatively: Refers to research done based on numbers (i.e. counting survey responses).\n\n\\---\n\nSome examples of beauty education done in very effective and engaging ways by scientific professionals:\n\n* [Science-y Hair Blog](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/)\n* [Lab Muffin Beauty Science](https://labmuffin.com/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd some examples of technique correction/education from non-scientific professionals (at least, I think so lol):\n\n* [This post about shaving technique](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/dwcjs9/why_your_lather_is_terrible_even_though_you_think/) (u/ItchyPooter)\n* [This video on \"bad hair habits\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5ep-upmHJA&t=382s) (Manes by Mell)\n* [This video that is just one of an entire series on makeup technique mistakes/corrections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdcRNqQkNbg) (Alexandra Anele)",

It will even work better in humid areas. If its cold and dry where you live, you have to make sure your lips dont dry too much in between steps and also between this treatment and whatever you use next on your lips. Personally i do this, wipe everything off then apply my preferred lip balm or lip products. I've heard of people running into the same issue with the leneige (?) Lip mask and they fix it by going near steam or get a room humidifier. You could also do this treatment before showering so you can wipe off all the gross joocy ded skin when you get out, ive done that before.",

    "body": "Happened upon a guide from a dermatology magazine from ye olde days of circa 2004 which outlined in laymen's terms the core principles of cleansing and moisturizing for different skin types and conditions. These basic key points haven't changed in well over several decades, despite all the gimmicks and new breakthroughs. Thought it'd be an interesting read for both skincare newbies just embarking on their journey and enthusiasts alike. \n\n \n\n# Making the Choice\n\nEvery patient needs to cleanse and moisturize skin properly using suitable cleansers and moisturizers containing the appropriate ingredients. In patients with compromised or sensitive skin, proper cleaning and moisturizing is even more critical. Using too harsh a cleanser or an inappropriate moisturizer can, in many cases, exacerbate certain conditions and can cause contact dermatitis and other problems. \n\nThe plethora of cleansers and moisturizers available today makes it difficult to keep current with new ingredients and their actions — or to guide patients in the selection of these products. In addition, few trials have looked at cleansers and moisturizers and their therapeutic value. \n\n“Dermatologists must understand the ingredients in the products their patients use and what they do to or for the skin. However, the market changes quickly and it is very difficult to keep up,” says Zoe Diana Draelos, M.D., P.A., Clinical Associate Professor, in the Department of Dermatology at Wake Forest University. “They need to keep abreast of this as much as they keep abreast of any aspect of their medical practice by reading journals and going to meetings This aspect of the dermatology practice is just as important as any other since cleansers and moisturizers have a dramatic impact on the skin.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What to Look for in a Moisturizer:**\n\nXerosis occurs when the water content in the skin is less than 10% to 20% — depending on the measurement method, and there is a loss of continuity of the stratum corneum. While moisturizers cannot repair skin, they can help restore the skin barrier and protect the skin as it heals. \n\n“Moisturizers need to stop water loss, decrease itching and burning, and make the skin feel smooth and soft,” says Dr. Draelos. “This creates an optimal environment for healing. Because the skin turns over every two weeks, healing can occur rapidly.” \n\nA good moisturizer should also be hypoallergenic, non-sensitizing, and non-comedogenic. The ingredients in moisturizers are often divided into occlusive agents, humectants, and emollients. \n\nOcclusive agents physically prevent or retard water loss. The most effective occlusive moisturizer is petrolatum. Lanolin, mineral oil, and silicones, such as dimethicone, are also very effective occlusive moisturizers. Applying an occlusive moisturizer immediately after bathing may be an effective way to trap additional water in the skin. \n\nHumectants attract and bind water and can improve the hydration of the stratum corneum. Effective humectants include propylene glycol, glycerin, urea, hyaluronic acid, and pyrrolidone carboxylate (NaPCA). However, high levels of humectants can draw water from surrounding cells and can actually dry the skin further. if not trapped by an occlusive agent. \n\nEmollients soften or soothe the skin by filling spaces between skin flakes and creating a smooth skin surface. They are usually light oily substances, such as octyl octanoate, sesame oil, grape seed oil, or cetyl stearate. Some emollients can also function as occlusive moisturizers. When combined with an emulsifier, the oily emollients are thoroughly mixed with the other water-soluble ingredients in the moisturizer. Emollients are probably the most important consumer ingredient in moisturizers since they provide the smooth skin feel associated with well-moisturized skin. \n\nMoisturizers may contain additional additives such as vitamins E, A, C, niacin, panthenol, peptides, polyphenols, aloe vera, and others. Alpha hydroxy acids, such as lactic acid or glycolic acid, may also be added to decrease cohesion of the excess stratum corneum cells, reducing roughness and scaling. The special ingredients are designed to function as cosmeceuticals imparting unique attributes to standard moisturizer formulations.\n\n Their final efficacy depends on how much of the ingredient is in the moisturizer and how the final formulation interacts with the skin. Despite their benefits, many patients resist using the most effective moisturizers since they often have unappealing characteristics. \n\n“Petrolatum is actually the very best moisturizer available, but it stains clothing, smells bad, and is greasy,” says Dr. Draelos. “Every other moisturizer on the market is trying to achieve the benefits of white petrolatum without the bad aesthetic effects.” \n\nAccording to Dr. Draelos, a good moisturizer should start with an occlusive agent, such as petrolatum or mineral oil, which is not as thick or greasy. It should also include occlusive ingredients that reduce greasiness, such as dimethicone, a type of silicone. \n\n“You might add grape seed, sesame, or some other lightweight oil and emollients, such as cetearyl alcohol,” says Dr. Draelos. “These are oils that can fit between the dry skin cells and make the skin feel smooth and soft.” It is also now possible to synthetically produce ceramides, which are some of the newest occlusive agents to enter the marketplace. \n\nDr. Draelos is excited about some of the newer developments in moisturizers. “The next generation of moisturizers are moisturizers used in a shower. Patients put the moisturizer on in the shower, and then rinse off. This novel technology effectively moisturizes the skin with long-lasting effects and is known as a new category of skincare products known as moisturizes.” *(These are available to us now.)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What to Look for in a Cleanser:**\n\nExcessive cleaning can damage the skin by washing out the natural humectant agents, change the pH value of the skin, and cause irritant contact dermatitis. \n\n“Cleansing damages the skin because the soap cannot distinguish between unwanted dirt and intercellular lipids,” says Dr. Draelos. “Synthetic detergents known as syndets are not as effective at removing dirt, but they do not remove as many intercellular lipids and are pH adjusted. A good alternative is the newer body washes that remove dirt, but leave behind a thin layer of petrolatum, especially if used with a puff.” \n\nWhen cleansing, all patients should use warm — not hot — water and bathe for not more than 10 minutes. Cleansing agents should be spread sparingly on the wet skin and, after briefly taking effect, completely rinsed off. \n\n“When looking for a cleanser, most patients should avoid cleaners with parabens, fragrances and detergents. Patients should also avoid detergents such as sodium lauryl sulfate,” says Leslie S. Baumann, M.D., Director of Cosmetic Dermatology at the University of Miami. “Ingredients to look for depend on the skin type, but acne-prone patients should look for cleansers with salicylic acid, while those with rosacea would look for sulfacetamide.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Acne** \n\nSome people with acne may try to stop outbreaks and oil production by scrubbing their skin and using strong detergent soaps and rough scrub pads. However, scrubbing will not improve acne; in fact, it can make the problem worse. Astringents are not recommended unless the skin is very oily, and then they should be used only on oily spots. \n\nPatients with acne should use a mild cleanser (5% benzoyl peroxide wash), once in the morning, once in the evening, and after heavy exercise. Acne suffers generally have oily skin, but the skin barrier can be compromised by treatment, leading to flaking and itching. \n\n“I recommend skin lubricants in the silicone family like cyclomethicone and dimethicone, which soften and hydrate without oils,” explains Mary Lupo, M.D., a dermatologist in private practice in New Orleans and professor of dermatology at Tulane University Medical School in New Orleans. “Cleansers should be mild if on treatment, but high surfactant cleansers or those with salicylic acid are good for oily and acne-prone skin.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Eczema & Other Dermatoses** \n\nAny skin disease will benefit from a moisturizer that strengthens the stratum corneum barrier, even blistering bullous pemphigoid. Moisturizing with a good moisturizer is also very important for a disease such as psoriasis. \n\n“Since this is a disease characterized by hyperkeratosis, keratolytics can play an important role in its treatment. Propylene glycol and lactic acid can be sole, or integral parts, of treatment regimens by effectively removing adherent scales,” says Andrea Trowers, M.D., a pediatric dermatologist who has completed a fellowship in pediatric dermatology at the University of Miami. \n\n“Plastic wrap, plastic gloves or plastic shower caps can be used to occlude the affected area after application of a keratolytic, resulting in increased efficacy.” Patients with eczema usually have an impaired stratum corneum barrier so they can benefit from a moisturizer that will help replace cholesterol, ceramides, and fatty acids. The only skin diseases that generally do not benefit from a moisturizer are conditions that are skin manifestations of internal diseases such as skin cancer. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Photoaged Skin** \n\nPhotoaged skin is generally treated with retinoids, which can dry the skin, especially during winter. For these patients, applying a moisturizer is helpful. The best moisturizing agent is petroleum jelly, but it is too greasy for most people, though a creamy version is available that is almost as moisturizing as the original. If other moisturizers are used, they should be the cream versions of the moisturizer. \n\n“Patients with photo-aged skin should avoid detergent cleansers with lots of surfactants. And they should look for added emollients like petrolatum to soothe,” explains Dr. Lupo. “Sodium laurel sulfate and many polysorbates can be very drying. Moisturizers with safflower oils and ceramide complexes are good. Humectants like glycerin are good as well.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Ethnic Skin** \n\nPatients with darker skin tones, often referred to as “ethnic skin,” have special concerns. “Ethnic skin is generally no more or less sensitive than lighter skin and all the same precautions apply,” says Heather Woolery-Lloyd, M.D., Director of Ethnic Skin Care for the University of Miami Department of Dermatology. “However, ethnic or darker skin is subject to certain conditions not usually associated with lighter skin, such as hyperpigmentation following irritation.” \n\nIf a cleanser or moisturizer causes an irritation on a fair-skinned person, any redness heals and the skin returns to its normal appearance. However, a darker-skinned individual may be left with dark brown patches on their skin, which is especially bothersome if it occurs on the face. E\n\nExcessive scrubbing and harsh cleansers in patients with conditions such as rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis heighten susceptibility to irritation that can lead to hyperpigmentation. Those patients should use the mildest cleanser and least irritating moisturizers. \n\n“While it is difficult to specifically predict which individuals will be irritated by a particular ingredient, a dermatologist should make sure that patients use products with fewer known irritants,” says Dr. Woolery-Lloyd. “Soapless cleansers are generally milder than traditional soaps and are especially useful in patients with sensitive skin prone to irritation. Additionally, traditional soaps combine with minerals in hard water and can leave an unwanted residue on skin and hair.” \n\nPatients with pseudofolliculitis barbae may find that cleansers with glycolic acid offer some relief. In addition, shaving gels with salicylic acid can be effective against in-grown hairs. However, these products can be very irritating and should not be used for individuals with sensitive skin. Another issue with darker skin is the ashy appearance of the skin when it becomes dry. While not necessarily a medical issue, it is still of concern to darker-skinned individuals. \n\n“Patients with dry, ashy skin will find products with lactic acid or urea to be effective,” says Dr. Woolery-Lloyd. “Because they not only moisturize and hydrate the skin, but they also exfoliate the superficial dry scale.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Elderly Skin** \n\nSince elderly patients do not produce a lot of sebum, their skin is dry and prone to itchiness. As a result, the elderly need to be especially careful about skincare. They should wash less frequently and should avoid cleansers as much as possible, relying almost exclusively on warm, not hot, water to rinse away surface dirt. Mild soap, such as glycerin soap, should only be used for local cleaning of, especially soiled areas. The elderly should moisturize frequently, especially after bathing when the skin is still moist. Bath oil can also be used, but patients must be careful about slipping. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Young Skin** \n\nMoisturizing is very important in pre-pubescent children since they do not produce a lot of sebum, and they generally get dirtier and require frequent bathing, which dries the skin. “As far as moisturizers, individuals with healthy skin can use most of the products. Just pick a product that leaves skin smooth, not tight or greasy,” says Dr. Lupo. “A combination moisturizer and sunscreen is an excellent choice because you can hydrate the skin and have the added benefit of preventing aging skin and skin cancers.” \n\n“Young children with ethnic skin who have dry skin — especially those living in colder climates — can relieve the dryness and alleviate the ashy appearance by using products like petroleum jelly or even vegetable shortening that has been refrigerated for a cooling effect,” says Dr. Trowers. \n\nOlder children often resist this approach because of the greasy feel, but products such as Cetaphil emollient cream can be almost as effective, with better cosmetic tolerance. According to Dr. Trowers, children of all skin types who suffer from atopic dermatitis often have more bacteria on the surface of the skin. More severe cases can be cleansed below the neck with chlorhexidine, or in milder cases with a product such as Cetaphil anti-bacterial soap, then bathed in a solution of Alpha Keri bath oil. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Understanding the Ingredients:**\n\nConsidering the difference that proper cleansing and moisturizing can make to dermatology patients, it is essential that every dermatologist understand the ingredients that go into moisturizers and cleansers — and the impact that those ingredients have on a patient’s skin. \n\n“Good practice in cleansing and moisturizing can make a significant difference for patients with certain skin conditions and as a therapeutic response to the side effects of medications used for treatment,” says Dr. Baumann. “It is very important for dermatologists and their patients to become familiar with the individual ingredients in moisturizers and cleansers and to know what they really do. Without this knowledge, you may not be able to respond appropriately because your patient has come in with an unfamiliar product, and you are unable to offer sound medical advice.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n   \n*Source: The Dermatologist Volume 12,  Issue 6,  June 2004*",

After being chronically ill for five years severely, I had developed thin old lady skin, and wanted to reverse that\n\n4) reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles \n\nFor the first 30 days, I used red light and NuFace daily. I did 2 1/2 minutes on the left side of my face, 2 1/2 minutes straight on, and 2 1/2 minutes on the right side of my face. I was 14” away from the panel. However, after a few weeks I noticed baby hairs sprouting in my “deep M widows peak” hairline. This was shocking, particularly because I had severe postpartum hair loss and it never grew back (my oldest is almost 7). I tried every single supplement known to man, and even went on hormone replacement therapy. The hair never ever grew! After one month and seeing the new hair growth, I added a five minutes alongside either of my hairline, <6” away from the panel. \n\nThen I read an article about cumulative dose issues, and realized I needed to start taking rest days. I started a three days on, one day off protocol, and that’s what I continue to do now. \n\nI’m really happy with the results!! I’m using a HOOGA HG300 I got on Black Friday sale for $127. Other things I believe have contributed to my results— I apply Corsx peptide serum and a glycerin based green tea extract (St Croix brand on amazon) twice a day before my moisturizer. ",

The next model up does have a 630 setting.\n\nIt's good to know that you're getting amazing results, but since you're doing the Trinity too, just hesitant. Ty",

    "body": "I woke on my back, spine pressed into a surface that mimicked grass—pliant yet unyielding, like memory foam carved into blades. Above me stretched a sky that defied language. Clouds hung frozen, their edges unnaturally crisp, as if cut from bleached felt and glued to an abyss. The void behind them was not mere darkness but *erasure*, a vacuum that gnawed at the edges of perception, like staring into the static between radio stations. Only the clouds tethered me to reality, their faint bioluminescent glow suggesting some alien photosynthesis, pulsing in slow, arrhythmic waves.\n\nThe field stretched infinitely in all directions, a fractal nightmare of uniformity. Each blade of grass was identical—chartreuse at the base, fading to citrine at the tip, precisely three millimeters wide. No soil nestled between them; they sprouted from a seamless mat of dull silver, like AstroTurf woven by machines. When I pressed my palm down, the stems didn’t bend. They resisted like plastic bristles yet emitted a faint organic musk—sweet and cloying, like rotting lilies. The air hung thick, devoid of humidity or temperature, as though the atmosphere itself had been vacuum-sealed.\n\nTime dissolved. Seconds bled into hours. My hand drifted to my chest—no rise, no fall. I clawed at my throat, fingertips sinking into gelatinous flesh that reknit instantly. Panic flared briefly in my mind but dissipated just as quickly; my body remained inert—a marionette with severed strings. When I raised my arm, the non-light of this place seeped through my skin, revealing a lattice of veins like cracked porcelain. My “flesh” was vellum soaked in glycerin; the grass beneath was visible as smudged impressions—a Magic Eye painting gone wrong. I waved a hand. No shadow followed. No proof I existed at all.\n\nA scream tore through my skull—silent and airless—a vacuum-sealed eruption that left no echo in this sterile void. My jaw unhinged grotesquely, tendons straining against their limits, yet no vibration troubled the stagnant air. Fear metastasized in my gut—a tumor with teeth—but my face stayed slack: a wax museum replica of terror.\n\nMovement flickered at the edge of my dead-aquarium vision. Three figures sat on the grass in the distance, their nudity neither provocative nor obscene—as if gender and modesty had been scrubbed from them entirely. Their skin mirrored mine: semi-opaque with a faint opalescent sheen, like soap bubbles moments before bursting. The oldest (or perhaps merely the most eroded?) rose first, his feet levitating a micron above the grass. Each step left no imprint or whisper of friction; he seemed to traverse a hologram rather than solid ground. Up close, his face resembled a Botticelli angel—flawless symmetry marred only by eyes without lids or lashes and lips that moved a half-second out of sync with his words.\n\n“Don’t worry.” The voice emanated from everywhere—the grass beneath me, the air around me, the inside of my molars. It resonated like a bow dragged across cello strings, vibrating deep in my marrow. “Everyone feels this way at first.”\n\nHe gestured toward the others: The woman hugged her knees tightly to her chest; her hair was frozen mid-sway—a cascade of liquid mercury caught in time. The teenage girl plucked at grass blades with fingers that passed through them like mist; her face was a mask of automated boredom. Their bodies flickered faintly as if buffering—edges pixelating like corrupted JPEGs struggling to render fully.\n\n“Come,” the old man intoned softly but firmly. “Sit with us. We’ll answer what we can.”\n\nTerror should have petrified me—but without cortisol or catecholamines coursing through me here in this place where biology had no dominion—fear became nothing more than an abstract concept: theoretical and distant.\n\nI floated forward instead—legs moving with marionette autonomy—and sank cross-legged beside him when commanded to do so. The grass beneath us remained preternaturally stiff: jabbing needle-tip precision into my thighs yet leaving no marks behind.\n\n“You must have many questions.” His voice rumbled through the ground beneath us—a sub-bass growl that vibrated up through my bones until it reached my teeth.\n\nTheir eyes pinned me: pupils dilated into black holes surrounded by faintly bioluminescent irises that pulsed faintly like dying embers in milk-glass sockets.\n\n“Where am I?” My voice startled even me when it emerged hollowly—reverberating oddly—as though spoken through an ancient tin-can telephone stretched taut between dimensions.\n\n“You’re in *Anamoní*,” he replied evenly while his lips stretched into something resembling a smile but not quite human enough for comfort—it didn’t crease his marble-smooth face naturally either way.\n\nThe name slithered off his tongue like syrup-thick vowels from some archaic dead language resurrected momentarily just long enough for its meaning alone to haunt its listener afterward indefinitely…\n\nI blinked. “So I’m not in heaven?”\n\n“Not yet.” His gesture swept toward the horizon, where the grass fused seamlessly with the anti-sky. “Anamoní is… a purgatory of patience. A sieve.” The others tilted their heads in unison, their necks creaking faintly like unoiled hinges. “We are the residue. The unworthy sediment.”\n\n“Waiting to get into heaven?”\n\n“Yes.” His finger traced the air, painting invisible sigils that dissolved as quickly as they formed. “Sixty-three years for me. Fifty-eight for her.” The woman’s nod was robotic, her hair frozen mid-sway like a suspended waterfall. “Nineteen for the child.” The girl mimed plucking grass, her fingers phasing through blades as static as plastic ferns. “Time here is not time.”\n\n“Why aren’t we *in* heaven?”\n\nHe leaned closer, his pupils glowing faintly—twin embers in milk-glass eyes. “The soul must… *molt*. Shed its husk—regret, greed, the rot of living. Until it’s weightless. Pure.” His gaze dropped to my chest. “But yours—yours already *burns*.”\n\nHe tapped my sternum with a sound like a dull *thud*, wet clay struck by a fist. “Look.”\n\nI glanced down.\n\nA glow pulsed beneath my wax-paper skin—not the sickly, guttering flicker of the others but a relentless white radiance, as if I’d swallowed a neutron star. The old man recoiled slightly, his own chest dimming like a bulb on a dying circuit.\n\n“You won’t linger here,” he whispered, his voice tinged with venomous envy.\n\nI squinted eastward, where the void blurred into a silver smudge on the horizon. “How do I *leave*?”\n\n“The angel descends for the ready.” The others stiffened at his words, their translucent faces contorting—mouths twitching, eyes narrowing—as if struck by invisible blows. “You’ll see the gate. The rest of us…” His voice frayed and unraveled into silence.\n\nThe girl resumed her pantomime, fingers raking through grass that refused to yield. The woman hugged her knees tightly to her chest, her chin resting on spectral joints. None spoke. None *needed* to.\n\nI followed the old man’s gaze eastward again, straining to see what he saw—or perhaps what he only hoped to see. But the void stared back at me with indifference.\n\nA shudder passed through the group like an electric current rippling through their forms. The woman’s hum sharpened into a whine; the girl’s fingers froze mid-pluck.\n\nI pressed forward with the question clawing up my throat: “If heaven’s real… is *hell*?”\n\nThe old man laughed—a dry rasp like beetles scuttling over dead leaves. “*Hell* is a fairy tale. A scarecrow.” He spread his arms wide, encompassing the frozen field around us—the waiting, the *nothing*. “Souls linger here until the angel comes to get them. I don’t think there’s a hell—it’s only this for us.”\n\nThe others blurred at their edges, their forms pixelating like corrupted film frames struggling to hold shape. The girl hissed softly, her voice frayed and brittle: “He’s been here longest. He *thinks* he knows. He *doesn’t*.”\n\nThe old man ignored her entirely. His gaze latched onto the horizon again, ravenous and unblinking. “You’ll learn the truths in heaven,” he said softly but firmly. “Ask God about hell. About us. About why your first breath mattered.” A pause stretched taut between us before he added: “Then come back and *tell* us… if you can.”\n\nSilence smothered the group like an oppressive fog.\n\nThe woman resumed rocking in place, her hum now tuneless and arrhythmic—a sound that gnawed at my nerves without rhythm or melody.\n\nAbove us, the void deepened further still—the clouds glowing whiter now—or was it my chest-light bleeding into this faux-sky?\n\nI opened my mouth—\n\n“Enough.” The old man raised a single finger sharply to silence me before I could speak further. “Save your breath,” he said flatly but not unkindly. “You’ll need it… *there*.”\n\nTime thickened around us like syrup poured over glass.\n\nWe sat together in silence—an excruciating stillness akin to holding one’s breath indefinitely—as though someone had pressed pause on existence itself. The old man’s quartz-like eyes drilled into the eastern void with unwavering focus while my questions curdled inside me, unspoken yet unbearably heavy—their weight crushing against my ghostly ribs.\n\nThen—  \n\nA tremor fissured the air—not a sound, but a *frequency*, a subsonic drone that vibrated the marrow of my translucent bones. The grass remained petrified, unyielding, but *we* shuddered, our forms rippling like oil on water. Above the eastern horizon, the void tore open with a soundless scream, its edges bleeding molten gold. From the rift poured light so pure it seared my ghostly eyes, etching afterimages of prismatic static onto my vision. And then the *thing* emerged.\n\nIt unfolded like an ancient star exhaling its first breath—a colossal orb armored in segmented plates of bone-white and gilt, each joint humming with celestial harmonics that resonated in my chest like the tolling of cathedral bells. Wings wider than cityscapes arched from its flanks, but these were no feathered limbs. They writhed with thousands of eyes—human pupils dilated in terror, goat-slitted irises glowing sulfur-yellow, compound insect lenses fracturing light into rainbows. Each eye blinked in discordant rhythm, their depths swirling with dying galaxies, newborn nebulae, and the cold fire of quasars being born.\n\nThe group jerked upright as one, their limbs snapping taut as if yanked by invisible strings. The old man wheeled toward me, his lips contorting soundlessly, his face a mask of raw hunger and venom. The angel’s wings beat once—a thunderclap that compressed the air into a diamond-hard wall—but not a single blade of grass quivered beneath us. It hovered there, suspended in its incomprehensible majesty, every eye swiveling to pin me in a kaleidoscope of gazes.\n\nThe voice impaled my skull:  \n\n**DO NOT BE AFRAID.**  \n\nIt was not sound but *sensation*—the taste of copper and burnt honey on my tongue; the smell of glaciers calving into arctic seas; the pressure of a supernova’s shockwave flattening my form into nothingness. My knees buckled under its weight, yet my terror dissolved into a narcotic haze—thick as opium smoke—coating my mind in velvet oblivion.\n\n**COME TO ME.**  \n\nI moved without volition—a marionette tugged skyward by invisible strings. The angel’s carapace peeled open with mechanical precision, its segmented plates retracting like the petals of some obscene metal flower. Within lay a core of liquid light that churned and writhed like molten plasma. It cascaded over me in a torrent, dissolving my translucent flesh in layers: first skin (cold and sharp, like alcohol evaporating), then muscle (a sigh of release), then bone (the snap of a shackle breaking). I should have screamed—but instead, I *unraveled*.  \n\n**YOU WILL DO PERFECTLY.**  \n\nThe light was neither warm nor cold—it was *revelation*. It flayed me to my essence, stripping away doubt, memory, fear—everything—until only a single radiant thread remained: pure and untainted by thought or form. My disintegration was not agony but *surrender*, the relief of a marathoner collapsing at the finish line: lungs heaving, soul singing.\n\nI ascended. The eyes on the wings tracked my rise with unblinking precision, galaxies spinning in their depths like cosmic clocks ticking down to some unknowable end. Below me, the figures dwindled: the old man’s mouth twisted into a silent curse; the girl’s half-raised hand trembled as though fighting an invisible leash that bound her to this place. Then the rift sealed itself with a wet, organic *snick*, and Anamoní winked out of existence.\n\nThe light swelled—a supernova in reverse—its brilliance contracting inward until it dimmed to a dying ember.\n\nDarkness.\n\nNot the hungry void I had seen before but something softer—a velvety oblivion dense with possibility. Somewhere in its depths, a faint hum resonated, the echo of a heartbeat… or perhaps the birth-cry of a star.\n\nConsciousness seeped back like ink spreading through oil. I blinked, and the sterile void of Anamoní had been replaced by a gilded nightmare. The field around me teemed with grass that *moved*—blades rippling in a breeze that carried no scent, no warmth.\n\nBeyond stretched a city that defied physics, spires of molten gold twisted into fractal patterns, bridges of translucent crystal arcing between towers like frozen lightning. The structures pulsed faintly, as though breathing, their surfaces crawling with hieroglyphs that squirmed when stared at directly.\n\nFar beyond it all loomed a throne the size of a mountain range, its edges blurred by distance and the sheer impossibility of its scale. Upon it sat a figure of pure radiance, its form shifting between humanoid and geometric abstraction, a head like a dying star swiveling slowly to survey its domain. The light from it pressed against my vision—not blinding but oppressive, like standing too close to an open furnace. I spun, searching for the old man, the girl—but I was alone.\n\nUntil I wasn’t.\n\nThey appeared without sound—two men carved from wax by a deranged sculptor. The taller one’s hair gleamed like polished brass; his companion’s was obsidian-black. Their features were mirror-symmetrical to the millimeter, too perfect to be human. No pores marred their alabaster skin; their eyelids didn’t flutter when they blinked. They moved in staggered unison, the shorter one always half a step behind.\n\nTheir robes shimmered with false humility, threads of light weaving through linen that hissed faintly, like radio static caught between stations. The shorter one tilted his head, eyes swallowing the light—pupils flat and depthless as event horizons. When he smiled, his teeth were slightly too large, slightly too sharp, slightly too white.\n\n“Hello, James.” The taller one’s voice was a wind chime made of bone. “Welcome to heaven’s… *workshop*.” He spread his arms wide, sleeves billowing to reveal wrists jointed like doll limbs. “Ask your questions. We do love fresh perspectives.”\n\n“What’s going *on*?” My voice echoed oddly in the space around us, as if the air itself resisted sound.\n\nThe shorter one buzzed—a locust’s rattle trapped in a human throat. “Tell me, James—” He tapped my chest with his fingertip, freezing cold against my translucent flesh. “—does it itch? The light inside? Like a trapped moth battering your ribs?”\n\nI staggered back instinctively. “What *is* it? Why does it feel… *alive*?”\n\n“Because it *hungers*.” The taller one began circling me like a predator stalking prey. “Most souls are clotted with prayer—diluted by millennia of groveling to imaginary gods. But you—” His breath smelled of burnt wiring and ozone. “—you starved yours. Let it grow *feral*. Untamed. A perfect battery.”\n\n“Battery? For *what*?” My voice cracked under the weight of his words.\n\nThe shorter one giggled—a sound like breaking glass underfoot. “The gears of paradise, James! The engines that spin the stars!” He gestured toward the distant throne with mock reverence. “Even *He* needs fuel. Especially now—with so few pure souls left to burn.”\n\n“But I didn’t *believe*! Why me?” My words tumbled out in desperation.\n\n“Belief is a *contaminant*.” The taller one’s smile stretched unnaturally wide, lips splitting at the corners without bleeding. “You’re a virgin wellspring: no saints, no sins, no tainted dogma—just raw, screaming *potential*.”\n\nI backed away further this time, my heels sinking into grass that gripped like tar. “You can’t just *take* it—”\n\n“Can’t we?” The taller one purred as if savoring my resistance. “But we’re so *generous*. We’ll even trade: a gift for a gift.” His pupils dilated until they swallowed his irises whole. “What does your mortal heart crave, James? Wealth? Power? Wings to flutter about like some songbird?”\n\nThe question curdled in the air between us.\n\n“Do I… have a choice?” My voice was barely above a whisper now.\n\nThe shorter one leaned in close enough for me to feel his breath—a dry rasp against my skin. “Choice is a *fairy tale*,” he hissed through teeth too sharp for his mouth. His tongue flickered briefly—forked and serpentine before retreating behind his grin. “But we’ll pretend you do. Play along! It’s more *fun*.”\n\nMy mind scrabbled for leverage as panic clawed at me from within. The throne’s light pulsed in my peripheral vision—a migraine wrapped in majesty—and I blurted out the first thing I could think of: “I—I want to fly! To be an angel.”\n\nThey froze.\n\nThen the shorter one *howled*, laughter shredding through the air in dissonant harmonics that made my ears ache. “*Fly?* You think feathers and harps? Oh, James—” He clutched his sides as if he might split open from amusement; his ribs creaked audibly under the strain. “—you’ll fly alright! Straight into the furnace!”\n\nThe taller one raised a hand sharply, silencing him with an almost imperceptible gesture. His expression softened into something resembling pity—or perhaps mockery disguised as mercy.\n\n“If flight is your desire…” His fingers snapped once.\n\nThe air tore open.\n\nA portal bloomed before us—a gyre of cobalt and magnesium-white light whose edges gnawed at reality itself like acid eating through fabric. The shorter one seized my arm with talons disguised as fingers; his grip burned cold against my spectral flesh.\n\n“Come, fledgling!” he hissed gleefully. “Let’s clip your wings!”\n\nI resisted instinctively—but the light inside my chest betrayed me: it tugged toward them as if magnetized by their presence or their willpower alone.\n\nMy body lurched forward without consent.\n\nThey stepped through first—their forms unraveling into shadow-puppet silhouettes as they disappeared into the portal’s swirling depths. It hummed ominously—a dentist’s drill amplified through infinite black holes—and then it was my turn.\n\nI followed.\n\nThe air turned gelid, thick with the sterile stench of formaldehyde and ozone. The room’s whiteness wasn’t just light—it was *absence*, leaching color from my vision until the world blurred into a nauseating void. Then I saw them: *a thousand eyes,* bulging from every surface like tumors. Their lids peeled back wetly, irises kaleidoscoping between reptilian slits and human pupils, each gaze drilling into me with predatory focus. The floor undulated faintly, a living carpet of eyeballs rolling beneath my feet, their viscous tears pooling around my ankles.\n\nThe golden slab dominated the room, sculpted into a gargantuan hand frozen mid-*reach*, fingers curled into talons. Its surface writhed with glyphs that squirmed like tapeworms, their edges glowing faintly bioluminescent, as if fed by rot. The air around it warped, humming with a subsonic frequency that vibrated my teeth.\n\n*“Lie down.”*\n\nThe shorter one’s voice wasn’t a sound—it was a command etched directly into my skull.\n\nI stumbled backward, but the eyes on the floor *shifted*, their collective gaze herding me toward the slab. My chest-light flickered erratically, casting jagged shadows that slithered up the walls like sentient stains.\n\n*“Lie. Down.”*\n\nHis words splintered into echoes, each syllable sharper than the last.\n\nLight-ropes lashed out—serpentine tendrils of liquid nitrogen, hissing and steaming as they coiled around my limbs. Their touch *burned* with a cold so absolute it felt like fire, searing through my spectral flesh into the core of whatever passed for my soul. I screamed, but the sound fractured into static, swallowed by the room’s insatiable whiteness.\n\nThe slab throbbed beneath me, its vibrations syncing with my unraveling pulse. The glyphs squirmed faster now, forming patterns that made my mind recoil—a language of tumors, of broken bones, of starved things chewing through the walls of reality.\n\nThe taller one raised a *prismatic shard,* its edges fracturing light into colors that *hurt*—ultraviolet, infrared, hues no human eye should perceive. *“Painless,”* he lied as he drove the shard into my shoulder blade.\n\n**My memories hemorrhaged**.\n\nFirst to go: my mother’s voice singing lullabies, dissolving into radio static. Then my first kiss—lips turning to ash; the taste of strawberry gum replaced by bile. The sting of a skinned knee; the thrill of a childhood bicycle ride; the warmth of a dog’s fur… all siphoned into the slab’s ravenous glow.\n\nVoices (mine? Theirs? *Others’?*) gibbered in a guttural tongue:\n\n*“Sclépius… Voré… Aphanízesthai…”*\n\n**The wing was a living blasphemy**—feathers of rusted iron, membranes veined with pulsating maggots, talons dripping viscous black fluid. The taller one rammed it into my shoulder blade. It *writhed*, burrowing into me with a sound like teeth grinding on bone. My back arched as the wing fused to my spine, tendrils of rot spreading through my veins like ink in water.\n\n**A flicker beyond the void**:\n- - -\n*Beep… beep… beep…*\n\nA hospital ceiling.\n\nA defibrillator’s crack.\n\n*“Clear!”*\n\nMy corpse jolted on the gurney.\n\nA nurse’s glove gripped my face:\n\n*“James! Stay with me!”*\n\n**Back in the white hell**, the shorter one sawed into my other shoulder blade, his serrated blade screeching against spectral bone. *“Hurry!”* he spat as the taller one slammed the second wing into me—this one chitinous and iridescent, its edges sharp enough to split atoms.\n\nMy chest-light dimmed further now, its radiance siphoned into the slab like blood draining from an open wound.\n\n**Another flicker**:\n- - -\n*Beep-beep-beep-beep.*\n\nA needle’s bite.\n\nCold fluid flooding my veins.\n\n*“V-fib converting! Don’t stop compressions!”*\n\nThe shorter one flipped me onto my stomach**, pinning me as the wings twitched to life—their grotesque sinews knotting themselves into muscle and bone. He plunged a scalpel deep into my sternum. Light—my light—gushed out in torrents, pooling on the slab before evaporating into hungry glyphs.\n\n*“TAKE IT!”* he howled, claws raking at my chest.\n\nThe taller one’s hands melted through my ribs like liquid mercury, grasping for the core of my soul-light. *“It’s rooted—he’s fighting us!”*\n\nThe shorter one’s face unraveled**—jaw unhinging; teeth splintering into glass shards; tongue elongating into a proboscis that stabbed toward my eye. *“You’ll crawl back,”* he hissed through his disintegrating grin. *“We’ll carve you out of that meatsack—we’ll—”*\n\n---\n\n*Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep.*\n\nSteady now. Relentless.\n\n*“Pulse stabilizing!”*\n\n*“James? Squeeze my hand!”*\n\n---\n\nThe white room shattered**.\n\nEyes burst like overripe fruit.\n\nWings crumbled to carcinogenic dust.\n\nThe men’s screams faded—not into silence but into something more human, the wail of a heart monitor.\n\n---\n\n**Darkness**.\n\nThen—\n\n**Weight**.\n\n**Heat**.\n\n**A throat raw from screaming**.\n\nFingers gripping mine tightly now—a tether pulling me back from oblivion.\n\n*“Welcome back James”*\n\nA face swam into focus—a man in blue scrubs, his features softened by the halo of fluorescent lights above. His stethoscope gleamed cold against his chest, and his breath smelled of spearmint gum and exhaustion. Behind him, monitors chirped arrhythmically, their screens casting jagged green shadows over the walls. My tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth, cotton-dry, as I tried to speak.\n\n“You’re a miracle!” The doctor’s voice cracked with a mix of awe and sleep deprivation. His pupils dilated slightly as he said it, as though even he didn’t believe his own words. A nurse hovered behind him, adjusting an IV bag with hands still trembling from the adrenaline of revival.\n\nReality seeped back in layers. The beep of the heart monitor synced with my pulse—*alive, alive, alive*. The starch-stiff sheets chafed my arms. The scent of antiseptic burned my nostrils. I clawed at the neck of my gown, gasping, expecting wings to burst from my back or golden ropes to snake around my wrists. But there was only the drip of the IV, the flicker of a muted TV in the corner, and the distant wail of a code blue over the hospital PA.\n\nWeeks dissolved into a haze of needle sticks and midnight panic attacks. ICU nights blurred into rehab mornings; my legs trembled like a fawn’s as I relearned stairs that now seemed to warp like Anamoní’s horizon. The cardiologist’s words played on loop during treadmill sessions: *“Ventricular fibrillation… chaotic electrical impulses…”* He traced my EKG with a manicured nail, oblivious to how its glyph-like squiggles made me vomit into biohazard bins. *“No blood flow for 10 minutes—miraculous you’re here.”* I nodded absently, fingering the new scar on my sternum—a raised star-shaped keloid no surgeon could explain.\n\nI never spoke of the eyes. The throne. The thing that called itself an angel.\n\n*They’d lock you up,* whispered shadows pooling beneath fluorescent lights during sleepless nights.\n\n*They’ll say it’s hypoxia,* hissed MRI machines as they scanned me for damage they couldn’t see.\n\nSo I let them chart my “PTSD” and “ICU delirium,” swallowing pills that made everything gauzy and dull.\n\nTo anyone reading this:\n\nHeaven is not what they told us.\n\nIt’s not gates or gold or glory—it’s machinery.\n\nAnamoní is its waiting room.\n\nIf you see the throne… if you see wings… if men with oil-slick eyes whisper your name—\n\n**Run.**\n\n**Fight.**\n\n**Let your soul burn out before they can siphon it dry.**\n\nBetter to fade into purgatory’s static than fuel their gilded eternity.\n\nI know how it sounds.\n\nI know what you’ll say.\n\nBut lean close—I’ll show you the scars where they tried to carve me open…  \n\nhow they glow in the dark at 10:00 PM. \n",

    "body": "Summer of 2010.  I was in AIT at Ft. Huachuca.  I was counting down the days until graduation and this Guardsman could go home to his family.\n\nAs a \"taste of home\", my wife would ship me a six pack of my favorite drink, Ale-8, about once a month.  Ale-8 is a local soft drink from central Kentucky, basically a local ginger ale with a little hint of citrus flavor, that comes in distinctive green glass bottles (that in retrospect, DO look a lot like beer bottles).\n\nDuring routine barracks fuckery, apparently some of my fellow trainees had been in my barracks room, peeked in my mini-fridge, and saw a few of those green glass bottles with \"Ale 8\" prominently on the label.\n\nBeing the Blue Falcons that most of my classmates were, they apparently narc'ed on me to the Cadre.\n\nSo, one evening in the barracks, not too long before lights out, we get word that the Platoon Sergeant on duty was coming by for a surprise barracks inspection.  Everyone out in the hall, by your door, at Parade Rest.  \n\nShe walks all the way down the hall to my door, demands to be let in. . .walks straight up to the mini-fridge, opens it, and goes into theatrics as she sees the green glass bottles and pulls one out.\n\n\"Well lookee here!  Beer in my barracks!  MyUsername has brought beer into MY barracks!\"  \n\nShe picks up one of the bottles, raising it over her head, brandishing it around as she starts to scream.\"\n\n\"MyUsername has brought beer into the barracks!  I'll have your rank for this!  I'll have your time for this!  I'll have your security clearance for this!  I WILL ***destroy*** your career for this!   MyUsername has dared to bring beer into MY barracks!. . .\"\n\nI sigh.  Roll my eyes, and shout. . .\n\n\"SERGEANT!  SOFT DRINK, SERGEANT!\"\n\nHearing me shout this snaps her out of her little song and dance number long enough to pause, stop holding that bottle up high, pull it down, look REAL close on the label, and sure enough, in small print below \"ALE 8\" is the words \"Soft Drink\".  She spins the bottle around in hand and there on the back are the ingredients \"Carbonated Water, Sugar, Vegetable Glycerin, Natural and Artificial Flavors. . .\"\n\nShe gets a disgusted and disappointed look on her face, and without saying another word just puts the bottle down on my desk and storms silently out of the barracks.\n\nI swear, it played out like a scene from a movie, or maybe a commercial.",

I just watched a video where a dude talked about someone snitching over some equally dumb shit during WOCS. Like y’all are so fucking bored that you have to fuck over someone else and probably by extension everyone else in the vicinity?\nIn OSUT we had dudes get in fights, show up with bruises, get asked about it, and even the losers didn’t say anything. Even if they didn’t so much as prompt the fight breaking out.\nAnd you got some nerd telling on grown ass people for drinking soda or sitting on beds lmao.\nNot sure how much of WOCS classes are street to seat types, but I’d like to think a bunch of prior enlisted would be less prone to snitching over dumb shit. \nI get AIT to some extend because kids are stupid and have yet to figure out that sometimes having someone’s back is more important than doing the “right” thing.",

    "body": "I'm running my first full marathon (26.2 miles) in October to commemorate my 50th birthday and raise money for the adoption agency that united me with a little boy in 2018. I decided to treat myself to a pair of \"real\" running shoes from Hanson's Running Shop in Royal Oak, MI (USA).\n\nAn associate brought out a pair of Brooks Glycerin GTS 20 (iirc). After I walked up and down the store aisles, she tells me I can try them on the treadmill at the back of the store, to which I reply, \"Really?! That would be AWESOME!\" (Note that I do not typically run on \"dreadmills\" due to my admittedly irrational hatred of them.) I cranked up the machine to 8.5 (whatever that means), realized that was a bit too fast, and pressed the [Off] button. After ~30 seconds, it was still g-r-a-d-u-a-l-l-y slowing down. 8.3.....8.1.........7.8......wtf -- just stop already! So I'm thinking to myself, \"Really experienced runners must have a cool way to just ride off the back of these things.\" And so... I tried 😑\n\nI slowed my pace just a little so I was running almost at the back of the treadmill deck. Then I tried like a 90-degree turn, expecting to casually complete the 180 as I glided onto the floor. Uh, WRONG. Instead, my feet were thrown off the back while my upper body slammed down onto the treadmill deck. As it pushed me toward the end, I tried to regain my balance to stand. But that made me roll over back onto the treadmill, which triggered my reflex to balance, which made me roll over... And repeat. Like an old rag in the dryer.\n\nAs this was happening, I felt compelled to call out \"It's me! It's me!\" As though the store associates might be wondering \"What was that banging sound? Perhaps I should investigate.\" But, upon hearing my assurances of \"It's me,\" would go back about their business and spare me the embarrassment of acknowledging what I had done.\n\nA few seconds after I stood up, the associate appeared and asked if I was okay. I said yes, and then noticed a line of blood on my baby blue shorts, and realized my left little finger was bleeding. I quickly cupped my hand to catch (and try to hide) the blood from dripping. As the associate tried to remount a Running magazine cover I'd knocked off the wall, she asked if I liked the shoes. I told her \"I think I need a wide.\" And later, when she asked if I wanted to try a different pair of shoes on the treadmill, I answered, \"You know, I just don't think I run the same on a treadmill as I do outside.\"\n\nTo exit as coolly as possible, I purchased a full price pair of Hoka Clifton 8, 10.5 wide. And no, they don't fit properly. And HELL-to-the-NO, I ain't goin back!\n\nTL;DR\nI fell off a treadmill at a fancy running shop, bled onto my shorts, bought a pair of $140 shoes just to exit with a tiny amount of dignity, the shoes don't fit, and I refuse to go back to the store.\n\n\nEdit: love the 💀 award 👌🏻 thank you!",

    "body": "This might get removed for low account karma. I don’t care. I need to get this out of my head, and to warn you all. \n\n\nA few months ago, I found an archived forum through a Tor mirror. Mostly dead links, old files, weird diagrams. It read like a cross between a survivalist message board and a metaphysics cult. One thread was titled “SOURCE LOCATION / YOUTH ZONE / MN-X GRID,” posted by someone with a username that was just a string of numbers and slashes.\n\n\nIt was about the Fountain of Youth. An actual place. The instructions were a mess: broken English, bad formatting, but one phrase came up over and over:\n\n“It doesn't matter where you start. Walk due True North. Do not drift. If the needle drifts, you’ve already passed it.”\n\n\nPeople in the thread argued about it. Some said “True North” meant geographic, others said it was an induced flux in the Earth's magnetic field, still others argued a \"cosmic north.\" \n\n\nOne guy said you needed a special kind of compass that could “attune” to local fields. Someone else posted a DIY schematic. No explanation, just a blurry photo of what looked like a needle floating in oil with some kind of stone casing around it. Hematite, maybe.\n\n\nIt was probably bullshit. But it hit something in me. I was in a weird place. Burned out, disconnected, jaded. The idea that there was a place, a zone you could walk into, and just be... undone. I couldn’t let it go.\n\n\nI built the compass myself. I followed the diagram with materials I barely understood. A quartz vial, thickened saline, glycerin maybe? Hematite ring as the outer shell. The needle floated, suspended, and every time I set it down, it didn’t just drift—it snapped into place. Like it knew where to point independent of where it was.\n\n\nI planned a solo trip into the northern Rockies. I packed light: mostly MREs and some small nonperishables. I brought a tent, backup compass (which I swore I wouldn’t use), a journal, a flare gun, and a map just in case. My only rule: follow that compass. Exactly. No rerouting. No detours. Just walk where it pointed.\n\n\nThe first week was peaceful. Cold, but manageable. Nights were long, and I could see every star. I slept in a bivy sack, kept my boots outside to avoid frost, and cooked with a tiny alcohol stove. Every morning, the compass needle would be waiting, pointing that same fixed direction like it never moved. It felt... obedient. Almost helpful.\n\n\nI walked maybe ten to twelve miles a day. Sometimes I napped in the shade, stretched my legs. I made camp when the sky shifted violet. There were no markers. No signs of other hikers. It felt like I was being led, like something was unfolding just for me.\n\n\nAround Day 11, I passed a rock shelf split down the middle: clean, vertical, like a knife wound. I remember stopping there, eating a chicken and rice MRE, writing in my log, staring out over a dry gulch. It felt important, so I marked it on my paper map.\nFour days later, I passed it again. Same rock. Same split. But this time, I was approaching from the opposite side.\n\n\nI checked the compass. Still pointing “north.” Still steady. But the angle felt... wrong. Not broken. Not reversed. Just slightly off, like a half of a degree to the west.\nI told myself I must have looped accidentally. Terrain does that. Hills pull you off course. But something in me knew.\n\n\nI kept going.\n\n\nBy Day 17, I passed a stacked pile of stones I swore I built myself. Same pattern. Same flat top where I’d laid a ration to cool. But I didn’t remember coming back this way. And the compass hadn’t changed. Still forward. Still locked-in.\n\n\nThat night, I made camp under a gnarled pine. I woke up once to pee and saw the compass needle twitch. Just once, like it was adjusting itself mid-dream.\n\n\nDay 19, I found an old fire pit with a burned can in the ashes. Same brand I’d eaten days before. I looked down and realized my bootprints were already in the soil.\nThat was the moment I remembered the post:\nIf the needle drifts, you’ve already passed it.\n\n\nI don’t remember making the decision, but I started walking faster. Not toward anything, just away. My food was running low. My hands were shaking. I hadn’t seen wildlife in days. Just the needle, pointing with more confidence than I had.\n\n\nBy the time I reached a frozen stream I’d definitely crossed before, the compass had turned completely. Still locked-on, but now pointing directly behind me.\n\n\nThat was the worst part. Not that it was broken. But that I never noticed it change.\n\n\nI camped again, in the same spot where I’d found my own note in a plastic bag under a high-branched cedar. I don’t remember leaving it.\n\n\nThat night, I left the compass on a rock next to my bag. I swear I didn’t sleep, but when I looked again, the needle was pointing at my chest. I stood up in a start, and the needle quivered in response. \n\n\nI made it out. Somehow. I followed the stars. The sun. Anything but the compass. I don’t remember hiking back. Just blinking, and being on the edge of a ranger station with cracked lips and dirt in my teeth. I got home three days later.\n\n\nThe compass is still in my apartment.\nI keep it on my desk. I’ve tried putting it in drawers, closets, boxes. It doesn’t matter. When I take it out, it points at me. Every time.\nI’ve spun it. Walked around the room. Held it upside down. The needle always finds me. Sometimes it moves before I do.\n\n\nAt first, I thought it was a trick of the gel, or magnetism. But I haven’t been sleeping well. And when I do, I wake up feeling different.\nNot sick. Just... off. \n\n\nMy handwriting’s cleaner. My joints don’t pop. I think my eyesight’s better.\n\n\nBut I forgot my sister’s birthday. I always remembered her birthday.\n\n\nYesterday I had a memory of my third-grade teacher, clear as day. I haven’t thought about her in decades. But I couldn’t remember my last job interview. Or my apartment number.\n\n\nI used to crave simplicity. I used to want the freedom of childhood—the lack of stress, the quiet inside my own head.\nBut that quiet is creeping in now.\nAnd it doesn’t feel like peace.\nIt feels like forgetting.\nI don’t think I found the Fountain.\nI think I passed it.\nAnd I think something followed me back.\n\n\nThe compass isn’t drifting anymore.\nI am.\nAnd I don’t know how far I’m going.\nOr who I’ll be when I get there.",

    "body": "Timeout muna sa review ng mga serum lotions dahil isang panibagong sunscreen na naman ang irereview ko ngayong araw. Ito ang Kagayaku Premium Tinted Sunscreen SPF 70 PA++++. Ang tagal kong hinintay nitong sunscreen na ito bago mai-deliver: inorder ko ng week ng April 21, dumating ng May 3. Uuriratin ko itong sunscreen na ito at titingnan kung worth it bang bilhin o waste of money lang. \n\nTLDR:\n\nHindi dapat tawaging premium ang sunscreen na ito. Tadtad ng errors ang ingredient list. Halatang di dumaan sa review bago i-mass print ang box at tube. Aside sa errors, magkaiba ang IL na nasa tube at nung nasa box. Plus, sobrang sakit sa mata basahin nung text na nasa back panel ng box, dahil sa white font na ginamit. And walang SPF test report. Sayang lang pera nyo sa product na ito. \n\nNabili ko itong sunscreen na ito sa halagang 295 pesos sa Tiktok. Out of the box, ang itsura ng tube nito ay reminiscent sa tube packaging ng SKIN1004 na sunscreen. From the tube, pump, pati na din sa cap nung pump. Pero walang silbi yung pump nito, hindi nadidispense yung laman kahit na makailang ulit na akong nagpump. So, no choice na ako kundi alisin ang pump cap at i-squeeze yung tube para lumabas yung laman. Apparently, masyadong viscous yung laman para lumabas sa pump. Halatang may mis-match sa characteristics nung content sa packaging na pinili. \n\nThe bulk product itself, sabi ko nga e viscous, pero nagbebreak ang emulsion upon skin contact. Yung binili ko e kulay brown, and ang appearance ng product is parang chocolate mousse. Yung amoy nito ay may chocolate gourmand notes, as well as konting floral notes. Lightweight ang product, madaling mag-spread sa balat, may light to medium coverage, walang whitecast, at kapag nag set na sa balat e wala akong nafi-feel. \n\nTumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list ng product na ito. Pinasakit ng IL ng product na ito ang mga mata ko. First, dahil ang hirap basahin ng text sa likod ng box dahil sa white font on top ng light beige background. Kinailangan ko pang i-edit yung contract settings nung pic para lang mabasa yung IL ng box. Second, dahil magkaiba ang IL na nasa box at nung nasa tube.\n\nIngredient list ng nasa tube:\n\nWater, Disodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate (and) C20-22 Alcohols, PEG-100 Stearate (and) Glyceryl Stearate, Polysorbate 60, Octocrylene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diisopropyl Adipate (and) Diisopropyl Sebacate (and) Propylene, C15-19 Alkane, Dimethicone, Titanium Dioxide (and) Alumina (and) Methicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate, CI 77491, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance\n\nEto naman ang IL na nasa box:\n\nWater, Disodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, C20-2 Alkyl Phosphate (and) C20-22 Alcohols, PEG-100 Stearate (and) Glyceryl Stearate, Polusorbate 60, Octocrylene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diisopropyl Adipate (and) Diisopropyl Sebacate (and) Propylene, C15-19 Alkane, Dimethicone, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate (and) Zinc Oxide (and) Polyhydroxystearic Acid (and) Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Titanium Dioxide (and) Alumina (and) Methicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate, Copolymer (and) Isohexadecane (and) Polysorbate 60 Iron Oxides (C.I. 77491) (and) Diisopropyl Dimer Dilinoleate (and) Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate (and) Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone (and) Hexyl Laurate (and) Perfluorohexylethyl Triethoxysilane, Titanium Dioxide (and) Diisopropyl Dimer Dilinoleate (and) Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate (and) Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone (and) Hexyl Laurate (and) Perfluorohexylethyl Triethoxysilane, Phenoxyethanol (and) Chlorphenesin (and) Aqua (and) Glycerin, Water, Gosypium Herbaceum (Cotton) Seed Extract (and) Punica Granatum Seed Extract (and) Glycerin (and) Trehalose (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Fructoligosaccharides (and) Water (Aqua) (and) Phytic Acid, Parfum (Fragrance) \n\nWhoo! Inang yan, ang sakit basahin at ilista nung IL. Sa dami ng mali sa IL nito, hindi ko alam kung ano uunahin ko. Pero dahil nasimulan ko na, sasagarin ko na:\n\n1. Dahil karamihan ng mga ingredients na ginamit dito ay complex mixtures (mapapansin nyo yung mga ingredient na tadtad ng (and) sa pagitan), either tinamad yung gumawa ng IL or just plain incompetent. Ang siste kasi kapag gumamit ng mixtures as ingredients sa isang formulation, kailangang alamin ang % composition nung mixture, then imutiply yung % ng every component ng mixture sa % nung ingredient mixture na ginamit sa formulation. Either tinamad na alamin at i-compute yung exact % nung mga components nung ingredient mixtures or hindi ito alam kung pano gawin nung gumawa ng IL. \n\n2. Hindi ko din alam kung anong trip nung gumawa ng IL at bakit inilagay as 2nd ingredient ang Disodium EDTA (chelating agent) at 3rd ingredient ang Triethanolamine (pH adjuster / neutralizing agent). Ang typical usage rate ng Disodium EDTA is usually below 1% (0.05% - 0.1%), samantalang ang Triethanolamine ay may maximum allowed use na 2.5% according sa Annex III ng ASEAN Cosmetic Directive. \n\n3. Sa tube IL, walang Zinc Oxide. Pero pagdating sa box IL, meron na. So, ano ba talaga, meron o walang Zinc Oxide sa sunscreen na ito? \n\n4. Since tinted sunscreen ito, expected ang presence ng Titanium dioxide, Iron Oxide Red (C.I. 77491), Iron Oxide Yellow (C.I. 77492), at Iron Oxide Black (C.I. 77499). Pero bakit sa IL ng tube at box, wala ang Iron Oxide Yellow at Iron Oxide Black? Yung totoo? \n\n5. Sa IL ng tube, Phenoxyethanol lang ang preservative. Pero pagdating sa IL ng box, may Chlorphenesin na.\n\n6. Sa IL ng box: Polusorbate 60. Polysorbate 60 dapat yan. Pero weirdly, tama naman nung naulit sa Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate, Copolymer (and) Isohexadecane (and) Polysorbate 60 (pero wala dapat comma after Taurate:   Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer ang tama) \n\n7. Sa IL ng box: entry should be Fructooligosaccharides, hindi Fructoligosaccharides. \n\n8. Sa IL ng box: Diisopropyl Adipate (and) Diisopropyl Sebacate (and) Propylene.  Propylene ano? Wala kaming time hulaan kung ano yan. \n\nIto na ata ang pinakamaraming mali na nakita ko sa IL ng isang product na na-launch sa Market. Sa dami ng pera (daw) ng brand owner nito, di man lang naisip mag-hire ng regulatory consultant man lang para ma-check yung IL ng product nya. \n\nNgayon, punta naman tayo sa product claims. \n\n* SPF 70 PA++++ UVA/UVB Protection\n\n* Tone Adapt Technology\n\n* Lightweight\n\n* Anti Aging\n\n* Whitening\n\nSa SPF claims, wala pa akong makita na SPF test result nito from the brand owner, kaya di ko muna paniniwalaan itong claim nila na ito. \n\nSa claim na Tone Adapt Technology, kalokohan yan. Marketing term lang yang tone adapt technology na yan. \n\nIn terms of being lightweight, yes lightweight naman ito nung sinubukan ko. For anti aging, pwede naman, since sunscreens helps with aging, specifically sa photoaging. But since wala pa akong makita na SPF test report ng product na ito, di muna ako agree sa claim na ito. In terms naman ng whitening, wala akong makita sa IL na skin whitening actives sa product na ito. \n\nFinal words:\n\nDi ko alam kung saan kumuha ng tigas ng mukha yung brand owner na tawaging \"Premium\" itong sunscreen na ito. Ni hindi nga nagawa ang bare minimum na i-check ang mga nakasulat na text sa packaging bago magproceed sa mass printing. Sa dami ng pera (daw) ng brand owner, mano man lang na nag-hire ng consultant para i-check yan. Tapos wala pang SPF test report. Sana nagpa-conduct sila ng 3rd party in-vivo SPF test, meron naman nag ooffer nyan dito sa Pilipinas. Afford naman nung brand owner, mayaman naman (daw) sya e. E di sana solid yung claim nyang SPF 70 PA ++++.\n\nHindi ko alam kung seryoso ba talaga yung brand sa paglaunch nitong product na ito o nagpapapansin lang, kasi sa buong pagwowork ko sa cosmetics industry, ngayon lang ako naka-encounter ng ganitong klase ng product na hindi ko mawari kung pinag isipan ba o napagtripan lang. \n\nSorry, pero first time ko sasabihin to sa pagrereview ko: Wag kayo magpabudol sa product na to. Masasayang lang pera nyo, marami pang ibang sunscreen jan na mas maganda. \n\nAyun lang. Maraming salamat sa pagbabasa. At laging maging mapanuri sa mga binibili at balak nating gamitin na products.

    "body": "\"Next!\" Called the officer \n\n\nA squat, mostly hairless biped approached the counter. It hefted a bag onto the countertop.\n\n\n\"Do you have any produce or food products?\"\n\n\n\"No.\" Said the biped.\n\n\n\"Any animals or controlled substances?\" The officer went through the list by memory, having asked it hundreds of times a cycle for the last 10 anums.\n\n\n\"None that I know of.\" Came the response.\n\n\nDid you pack your own bag, and has it been in your possession the whole time since you packed it?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah. Well, my wife put some socks and stuff in, but I saw her do it. Does that count?\"\n\n\n\"That's fine. Do you have any object, substance, or material known to the GLQ to cause harm to any member species?\"\n\n\n\"Don't think so.\" The biped said.\n\n\nThe officer spun the bag around so he could access the closure. \"Planet of origin?\"  He placed his hand on the button.\n\n\n\"Earth.\"\n\n\nThe officer snatched his hand away from the bag. His skin turned a slightly green color.\n\n\n\"Human?\"\n\n\n\"Uh, yes.\" The biped replied, somewhat confused.\n\n\nThe officer reached over and picked up a comm device. He pressed a quick dial key, and held the device up to speak into it, turning away from the human on the other side of the counter.\n\n\n\"Sir. One of THEM is here. No, sir. I stopped before I opened it. He says no. Ok. Ok. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.\" The officer deactivated the device and turned back to the human. \n\n\n\"Sir, you need to go with these officers here.\" As he spoke, two large Gorilla-noceros looking guards stepped up behind the man. He looked confused.\n\n\n\"This way, sir.\" One of them said, pointing towards a door in the wall some distance away. \"Leave the bag.\"\n\n\nThe man turned to go, but before he walked away, he saw his original customs office spraying down his hands, the counter, the comm device, and the man's bag with some sort of mister.\n\n\n***** --- *****\n\n\nAn alien in a full bio containment suit was slowly lifting every item out of the man's bag. Each item was placed under the scope of some sort of scanner, which would hum for a moment, and then ding. The item was then placed on a plastic tote.\n\n\nThe man sat as each garment was processed. The last thing the alien pulled from the suitcase was a small toiletries kit.\n\n\nThe man said \"It's just, like toothpaste and soap and stuff. Snothin' dangerous.\"\n\n\nThe bio contained officer slowly opened the bag, and began to lay out items, one after another. A clear green bar of soap, a tube of toothpaste, a small bottle of shampoo, and a stick of deodorant. A toothbrush and electric razor were the last items placed on the table, and the first to go into the scanner. Each was followed by a ding.\n\n\nNext, the deodorant was tested, another ding.\n\n\nThe toothpaste was tested.\n\n\nThis time, there was a loud buzz.\n\n\nAfter a moment, the officer in the containment suit placed the whole tube into a plastic jar and sealed it.\n\n\nThe bar of soap met the same fate, being sealed in another separate jar.\n\n\nFinally, the shampoo was tested. The scanner hummed for what seemed like an eternity, and finally, a bell started ringing.\n\n\nThe man looked around, confused. \n\n\nThe officer pulled a pair of tongs from somewhere, grabbed the shampoo, and put it in another jar. Then, the jar was placed in a clear bag, which was sealed, and then finally, the bag was placed in a metal case, which was again sealed. \n\n\nThe officer went to a corner of the room, and reached up to pull a ring hanging near the ceiling. A bluish liquid showered down on the bio containment suit. After several minutes. The officer walked out of the room, taking the specimen jars and case with him.\n\n\nMoments later, another customs officer came in. This one was human. She was smiling.\n\n\nThe man looked at her for a moment, and then said \"Am I in trouble?\"\n\n\n\"Probably not. Most of the time, these are just run of the mill, accidental breaches. As long as your shampoo is really shampoo, you'll be fine.\" She sat opposite the man, and leaned forward onto the small table where the tote with his belongings was.\n\n\n\"Turns out, things like glycerin and fluoride are on the 'special access' list. Meaning you need a permit. Some of the stuff in shampoo is considered… well, it's not allowed. Highly toxic to about 85% of the flaura and fauna of non earth planets. As long as it isn't just straight toxins, you'll get charged a shipping fee to send it back to earth. It's technically a controlled substance in the rest of the galaxy. Most humans who go out of system for the first time don't know. \"\n\n\n\"I was just trying to go see my old navy buddy. I didn't mean to cause problems.\" The man said, clearly nervous and apologetic. \n\n\n\"It's fine, that's why we have these protocols in place. That aside,\" the office pulled a sheet of paper out of her uniform pocket, \" here's a list of suitable alternatives you can find on most GLQ planets to replace the items we confiscated.\"\n\n\n\"I really am sorry about this.\" The man said, glancing over the list.\n\n\n\"No worries. Just be glad you didn't bring any food with you. We had a chef come through once with a whole case of herbs and spices. He dropped a jar of thyme. We had to close a whole terminal until it was decontaminated.\"\n\n \n\nThe officer stood up and turned to go. \"Enjoy your trip!\"\n\n*****---*****\nHope you enjoy!",

    "body": "Hello all! So I was answering a question on r/AsianBeauty, but I thought maybe it will help some other people out who is dealing with dehydrated skin.\n\nSeveral years ago, I was a dumbass and used vitamin c crystals and mixed with water and used that for my \"vitamin c serum\" and completely overexfoliated my skin/got a chemical burn basically. And before and after that too, I thought exfoliating more was better (using AHA/glycolic acid/lactic acid), and did that everyday, which caused my skin barrier to get reck'd.\n\nIt took me a good year/year-and-a-half to fix my skin. This is what worked for me personally:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what I do is use a very gentle, non-foaming cleanser (I use [LRP Gentle Hydrating](https://www.amazon.com/Roche-Posay-Toleriane-Hydrating-Gentle-Cleanser/dp/B01N7T7JKJ/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538877830&sr=8-1&keywords=la%2Broche%2Bposay%2Bhydrating&th=1)) and while my face is still wet, put on all my hydrating toners and serums. Then go into lotions and creams RIGHT AWAY. Putting on occlusives right away after you wash and put on humectants is super important. Otherwise they can actually dry your skin out more.\n\nWhen my skin was SO full of pain, from extremely dry, tight skin and irritated acne-like cysts everywhere, the only thing that didn’t hurt like a mf was Vanicream. It took me hundreds of dollars and tons of trial and error and babying my skin to get it back to normal. Now I can use AHA, azelaic acid, vitamin c, and even tretinoin and hydroquinone without a problem!!!\n\nNo one or two products fixed my dehydrated skin. It took a TON of research over the years learning which ingredients were the most healing, moisturizing, how they work, etc.. And an entire routine around hydrating and moisturizing as much as possible. \n\n**I always make sure to include ingredients like:** panthenol (derivative of vitamin b5), allantoin, urea (a HUGE factor in getting my skin back to normal), hualuronic acid, glycerin, aloe, colloidal oatmeal, ceramides (important!!!), niacinamide (especially useful for brightening and healing your skin), petroleum (studies show that there is NOTHING out there that reduces transepidermal water loss like petroleum can. I tried to be all \\~natural is better\\~ for a while, but realized it wasn't doing anything to help fix my skin), etc.\n\nAnd not just adding these helped fix my skin, but **leaving things out** was a YUGE step in finally letting my skin heal. I avoid these like the plague: fragrance, natural (essential oils) or synthetic, alcohol anywhere other than sunscreen, sodium lauryl sulfate (sodium LAURETH sulfate is the gentler one, but I avoid that for my face too anyways. Surfectants can be aided to be milder by adding cocamidopropyl betaine), **LAY OFF all acids** until my skin could handle them (interestingly enough, vitamin c serum actually helped my skin hold more water instead of hurting me), and things that I know irritate my skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Things that were/are biggest contributors of keeping my skin moist and hydrated, in no particular order:**\n\n[**Thayers Unscented Alcohol-Free Witch Haze**l](https://www.amazon.com/Thayers-Alcohol-free-Unscented-Witch-12-oz/dp/B0045PCAI6/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871279&sr=8-1&keywords=thayers+unscented) \\- the first thing that goes on my skin after washing. It's just water, aloe, glycerin and witch hazel. It's so simple but idk why my skin likes it so much, lol. It's HG for me.\n\n[**Hadalabo Premium Lotion**](https://www.amazon.com/Hadalabo-Skin-Institute-hyaluronic-solution/dp/B013HHJV0C/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871410&sr=8-1&keywords=hadalabo+premium) \\- HG, must have. **Hyaluronic acids**, urea, algae. This is my one non-negotiable skin care item.\n\n[**Aveeno Eczema Therapy Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Eczema-Therapy-Moisturizing-Sensitive/dp/B003O7IBZC/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871429&sr=8-3&keywords=aveeno%2Beczema&th=1) \\- Super moisturizing. **Colloidal oatmeal**, glycerin, panthenol, petrolatum, a ceramide, dimethicone. (People demonize silicones, but they are not bad ingredients. They are actually really helpful in keeping in moisture, providing slip, and smooth feel for skin and hair. And no, they don't prevent other things from reaching the skin. [More on silicones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXHA7_dBRJY&t=12s).) And [Aveeno Eczema Therapy Night Time Balm](https://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Baby-Nighttime-Colloidal-Dimethicone/dp/B01HI7VY84/ref=sr_1_4_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871429&sr=8-4&keywords=aveeno+eczema) for something heavier but has same ingredients. You can use both.\n\nAnd of course, [**CeraVe Moisturizing Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Cream-Daily-Moisturizer/dp/B00TTD9BRC/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871829&sr=8-3&keywords=cerave+cream) \\- **ceramides, cholesterol, must have skin-identical lipids** that dehydrated skin lacks, hyaluronic acid, petrolatum, dimethicone. This by itself didn't help a whole lot, but with an army of all the different gentle, soothing things, it helped tremendously. There are lots of other \"golden ratio\"/fragrance-free ceramide stuff out there, CeraVe isn't the only one. Some of them are: [Stratia Liquid Gold](https://www.stratiaskin.com/products/liquid-gold), [Meishoku CeraColla gel](https://www.ebay.com/itm/JAPAN-MEISHOKU-CERACOLLA-MOISTURIZER-CREAM-50g-FACE-SKIN-CARE/173351832927?epid=1541103247&hash=item285c930d5f%3Ag%3AjbkAAOSweEFbFoJ-&LH_BIN=1) (they have toners as well), [Superdrug Hydrating Serum](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face-Skin-Care/Face-Serums/Superdrug-Simply-Pure-Hydrating-Serum-50ml/p/342700), [Curel Fragrance-Free lotions](https://www.amazon.com/Cur%C3%A9l-Fragrance-Comforting-Lotion-Sensitive/dp/B00171ETM6?th=1), [Ziaja Med Atopic Dermatitis Regenerating Face Cream](https://yanca.co.uk/product-eng-16098-Ziaja-Med-AD-Atopic-Dermatitis-Regenerating-CREAM-oiling-the-skin-atopic-for-infants-children-and-adults-50ml-5901887027942.html), among many others.\n\n[**CeraVe PM**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Facial-Moisturizing-Lotion-Lightweight/dp/B079H99466/ref=sr_1_1_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1538872080&sr=1-1&keywords=cerave+pm)\\- same as the cream, but much, much lighter and has 4% **niacinamide** I believe. Niacinamide has been key to helping my dry-ass skin. It does SO many things. Heals and mends, fades spots,etc. etc. I DIY 6% niacinamide and 5% **n-acetyl glucosamine** to boost the niacinamide even further. (Commercial version [Skinlex 10% Niacinamide Serum](https://www.skinlex.com/product/10-niacinamide-serum-60ml/)) But you can find this ingredient in loads of Asian Beauty things and Olay products. Make sure the Olay stuff is fragrance-free if you get them. I like the [Olay Anti-Aging Face Cream](https://www.amazon.com/Olay-Anti-Aging-Moisturizer-Micro-Sculpting-Fragrance-Free/dp/B007M81B4M/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872043&sr=8-3&keywords=olay+fragrance+free) a lot. It really helps refine texture, as well. You can use the CeraVe moisturizing lotion if you for some reason can't tolerate niacinamide, but want something lighter than the cream. Really, any one of CeraVe products is good, they have loads.\n\n[**Aquaphor Healing Ointment**](https://www.amazon.com/Aquaphor-Advanced-Therapy-Ointment-Protectant/dp/B0107QPFBU/ref=sr_1_5_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872144&sr=8-5&keywords=aquaphor) \\- SLUG LIFE is a MUST if you have dehydrated skin. You can use Cerave healing ointment too, but it's redundant if you use the cream or lotion. It's not as occlusive as aquaphor. Aquaphor isn't just a more pricier Vaseline as people suggest. It does have white petrolatum that is oh-so helpful, it also has healing ingredients like panthenol and bisobolol, and also lanolin alcohol and glycerin for humectants.\n\nIf you wanna go a step further and go super saiyan, and you aren't sensitive to lanolin, you can use [**Lasinoh Lanolin**](https://www.target.com/p/lansinoh-hpa-lanolin-tube/-/A-92544) before or after Aquaphor. I can't stand the smell of lanolin, but this one is medical-grade and doesn't have a smell. Lanolin is SUPER helpful because of it's crazy humectant properties but it also acts as an occlusive.\n\nFor just uber **Panthenol** healing, you can get something that stars it as the main star ingredient, like [**DML Forte Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/DML-Forte-Panthenol-4-Ounces/dp/B000052YN6/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872923&sr=8-3&keywords=forte+cream) or [**Timeless Skin Care Vitamin B5 Serum**](https://www.timelessha.com/products/vitamin-b5-serum-1-oz)**.** I don't use the cream anymore, but I do still use the serum. It looks expensive, but if you get the refill sale, it's about $7/oz (this is the price for me in the U.S.). I HIGHLY recommend their [vitamin c, e, ferulic acid serum](https://www.timelessha.com/products/20-vitamin-c-e-ferulic-acid-serum-1-oz) as well when your skin can handle it. It works out to **about $8 an ounce** if you get it during refill sale. It stays good for a while in the fridge. I wrap it in foil to keep more light out and transfer some to a 1 oz dropper bottle for using it in my bathroom. It gives glow to your skin like ***NOTHING ELSE***, and boosts your sunscreen (the antioxidants slow the degradation of sunscreen ingredients) and has helped me with water retention. If you can't get it on refill sale, use the HotandFlashy (I also recommend her Youtube channel) code hf5off to get $5 off. It's a forever coupon code.\n\n**Urea** is **SO, SO,** **SO** helpful for healing dehydrated skin. It's an amazing humectant but also a mild exfoliator if you have a high enough %. [**Eucerin 5% Urea Face Cream**](https://us.feelunique.com/p/eucerin-dry-skin-replenishing-face-cream-night-5-urea-50ml?utm_source=googlebaseus&utm_medium=gen&gclid=eaiaiqobchmi4cftgp3z3qivc39-ch3qhgiheakyaiabegjud_d_bwe&gclsrc=aw.ds&curr=USD) is awesome for this. I don't use that anymore simply because it's more of a hassle to get (not available in the U.S.). My skin looks AMAZING with the [**TriDerma MD Eczema Fast Healing Cream**](https://www.walmart.com/ip/TriDerma-MD-Eczema-Fast-Healing-Face-and-Body-Lotion-with-Bonus-Tube-4-2-oz/21656991) used as a sleeping pack. It's full of skin-healing goodies, like urea (of course), 1.5% Colloidal Oatmeal, aloe, allantoin, arnica extract (a flower thingy that helps heal wounds), beeswax (beeswax and lecithin have great skin-identical components much like ceramides), shea butter, zinc and sodium PCA, and squalane.\n\n**Squalane** is another skin-identical ingredient that you can incorporate into your skin care. I use [this](https://www.timelessha.com/products/squalane-100-pure) one for now, but you can also get the oil at [gardenofwisdom.com](https://gardenofwisdom.com) or [lotioncrafter.com](https://lotioncrafter.com). The GoW one is a little bit more thinner more astringent-feeling to me for some reason than Timeless's.\n\nAnd while you're at it, mix in some other healing oils that help heal skin. Linoleic acid is very important in skin health and wound healing. Oils that tend to be high in these go off faster, however. So you may want to keep them in the fridge. Add in 1% mixed tocopherols (vitamin e) to extend the shelf life of your oils. I like hemp seed, wheatgerm, chamomile/calendula, rosehip oils (can aggravate acne if you're acne-prone). My choice of oils for my facial oil serum: 50% borage seed oil (the best healing), 29% squalane oil, 10% seabuck thorn BERRY oil (very different fatty acid profile to the seed oil), and 10% pomegranate (filled with antioxidants), 1% mixed tocopherols.\n\nSomething that really helps is layering a ton of humectants/watery steps in my routine. You can experiment with this, but right now I'm using the Thayers witch hazel, my vitamin c serum, timeless vitamin b5 serum, [**innisfree aloe gel**](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Innisfree-Aloe-Revital-Soothing-Gel-300ml/302699871225?epid=4002960484&hash=item467a517bf9:g:gy4AAOSwsTday~0A) (unscented, aloe, centella stuff), CosRX Snail, and Hadalabo Premium. I plan to get [Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495) (way cheaper on eBay- like \\~$12).\n\nYou don't **need** a shit load of expensive things to heal dehydrated skin. In fact, a lot of the expensive stuff I see are filled with tons of unnecessary, possibly skin irritating plant extracts and essential oils, super fragranced. Many people go, oh it's fine bc it doesn't irritate my skin, but it's not just \"I'm sensitive to this\" vs \"I'm not\". It's likely that you can develop an allergy or sensitivity to a certain ingredient the longer you use it.  Like how some people develop sensitivity to latex after using eyelash glue with it in it for a while, or people developing sensitivity with lavender after prolonged exposure to the essential oil or something.\n\nAnyway, I hope that was helpful to anyone out there who struggled like I did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: Also, I realized throughout my journey and research, a lot of things that look like \"break outs\", pimples, acne, aren't actually acne. Yeah, you can have acne due to bacteria or fungus or whatever else, but the stuff I'm talking about isn't really acne. Inflammation doesn't just manifest as rashes and thelike. A lot of things that look like acne are actually your skin saying \"no, this is irritating! Get it off me!\", like after you try a new thing for example. But that doesn't mean it will irritate it forever. You can use things that used to irritate your skin after your barrier heals. But some things you may be sensitive to forever..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDITED TO ADD 06/26/2019: AMINO ACIDS are also very important! They make up 40% of our stratum corneum (according to Susan from swiftcraftymoney)! If you want to fix your barrier, you want ingredients like amino acids, sodium PCA, sodium lactate, urea, and sugars like glycerin, fructose, what-have-you! For fatty acids, you want things like linoleic acids, oleic acids, and linolenic acids. Beeswax, lecithin, and lanolin are all great for rebuilding your barrier.\n\nI have not tried this, but The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA is a really good product with all of these NMFs. A pricy one is Paula's Choice Omega+ Complex (the serum, the moisturizer is okay too, but the serum has a lot more skin rebuilding goodies).",

Hydroquinone is not \"banned\" in other countries. It's just prescription-only because it's a very strong active so governments decided that people will need to use it under a doctor's supervision to avoid abuse.)",

I picked up some vegetable glycerin to mix with the honey and I'm going to try that tomorrow. But as I've been trying to research this stuff, I've read some things about how using too much glycerin can make your skin drier? Honestly, I'm so overwhelmed and confused.\n\nI'd love to incorporate more moisture layers into my new routine, because I definitely feel like my moisture barrier is damaged and I'm trying not to freak out. I'm hoping it won't take me super long to recover, since it's really just the past week that I went overboard and hurt my skin. But who knows, maybe I have made my skin upset over time with fragrances and actives over time :/\n\nhow did you go about introducing new products when your issue started? I want to start using the cetaphil moisturizer if possible, and other products with ceramides, urea, etc etc BUT i can't seem to find any that are totally free from the ingredients that seem to be irritating me now... I dont want to buy products that will just sting and irritate me further, but I also don't want to prolong healing by not giving my skin everything it needs?\n\nsorry this is so long ashdsgkhflj thank you if you read this far\n\nEdit/update: I can tolerate the cetaphil Moisturizer now and it helps me feel hydrated, but I’ve started breaking out with some whiteheads, which is atypical for me (usually I get cystic pimples and CCs)",

It had been over a year since my husband and I had sex (shoot, I just recently began using tampons again) but after much stressing about it and talking about it (and failed attempts), we had sex last night! We took it very slowly and used a looot of Astroglide (natural - no glycerin or paraben), but we were able to have sex, and it wasn't horrible! I didn't have any tearing or burning (major problem in the past), and this morning I don't feel like I have a brand new yeast infection!  In fact, my lady parts feel totally normal! I'm sorry if this is TMI, but I had to tell SOMEONE because I'm so excited!  Both my husband and I were beginning to worry if we'd ever be \"normal\" again and have an ok sex life, and last night was proof positive that we CAN get that back!  I'm not so afraid of sex now and I have a wonderful, supportive partner.\n\nI feel like a huge weight has been lifted, and you guys are such a great support system, even though I don't know any of you!  I just needed to share :)  \n\nP.S. We're probably going to give it a go again tomorrow. :)\n\nEDIT: WHOA! Thank you guys so much for the support and kind words! THIS is why I love this subreddit. You guys are awesome!\n\nEDIT 2: I am shocked to hear how many of you suffer/have suffered from similar things. I'm so glad we can, as a community, help each other out and trade information, because it seems like a lot of women suffer from the same things, but silently. There is SO MUCH information out there regarding UTIs/BV/Yeast/medications, and I'm so glad all of this good info. is being exchanged. I wish we talked about it more, honestly, because these problems can feel so isolating and baffling. ",

Ease back into the pool, so to speak. (Like, maybe wait a few days in between encounters, for the first few weeks at least.)\n\n\n(b) Get up and go pee immediately after sex. Urine is sterile, and taking a good hard piss right after sex is the best and most natural way to clean out the bacteria that got banged up into your urethra during the act.\n\n(c) Drinking sugar-free 100% cranberry juice is the best stuff to prevent a UTI, but it tastes like crap.

        "body": "I am so happy for you! I know how difficult it can be to feel normal after problems in that area. I was on Cipro for a nasty Kidney stone ordeal earlier this year, and was lucky enough to suffer the same side effects. I'm just now beginning to even out, much thanks to my urologist. He's a magician.\n\nAnywho, I feel like I should share some of the tips he's been giving me to stay healthy down there because I want you to keep your sex life in-tact!\n\nAvoid cranberry juice. The quantity you have to drink for it to be effect is too high for it to be healthy for you. Stick with the capsules if you can find them, and if you can't, it's no sweat. It's not *that* effective to begin with.\n\nHave a beer sometimes. The darker, the better. Beer helps prevent calcium deposits from forming in your kidney/bladder. So no sediment in your urine, which means no irritation and no scraps that bacteria can hold onto and grow in. Remember moderation, because too much alcohol is a bladder irritant and will do more harm than good.\n\nBlueberries! They help restructure your urinary tract and bladder walls, in a way that won't let bacteria grab hold of. Think like super slippery, just kind of bounces off and flushes when you pee.\n\nAnd peeing. Do it often. If you're near a bathroom, try going pee. I know it may sound silly but the more you flush the urine from your bladder, the less time bacteria has to grow. And never, never, never hold it in. If you have to pee, you have to pee. \n\nAnd of course, water. Drink a lot. I had a hard time with this at first, but I don't regret it now. I haven't had a UTI in months, my skin has been so clear, and I've lost little chunks of fat around my body. Urologist said to always have a full glass/bottle of water near myself. If I'm hungry and it isn't meal time, drink water until you aren't hungry, but I say if it's around 3-4pm between lunch and dinner, have a little snack with that water.\n\nAt first with the water, I'd feel sick to my stomach since I was so used to feeling hungry for part of the day. I wasn't used to having that full feeling a lot, and my body wasn't used to actually having to digest something all day long. But I feel better now, I have more energy and don't crash randomly during the day.\n\nAnd lastly! Foods to avoid in high quantity. Dairy, alcohol, and red meat. Dairy and red meat are very acidic foods and will help bacteria grow. Try and ditch the caffeine and soda, too.\n\nOkay, I'm done. I'm sorry if that was overwhelming, but it's all helped me keep my urinary system healthy and working as intended.\n\nAnd again, I'm super happy for you two! A thriving sex life can make your relationship feel like new, and I'm excited for you to experience it again.",

Tampons seriously mess with the natural environment (moisture, pH, etc) of the vagina because of their absorbency and abrasiveness, and their use can carry an increased risk of yeast infections and of course the danger of toxic shock syndrome! Menstrual cups are *not* absorbent, are completely inert, and are therefore much friendlier to the vaginal environment. They are made of medical-grade silicone. They take a bit of practice to get the hang of, but once you get used to it most women are hooked.\n\nAnyway....congratulations on sexytime!",

My doctors think they are close to figuring out what's wrong with me but I've heard it before. At first I was told it was nothing and all my pain issues would pass and I accepted that for a year because I was younger. Changed my doctors and they thought it was UTIs and yeast infections but it wasn't, so they next thought ovarian cysts and I had some but that wasn't it.  They moved on to endometriosis and did the surgery to take a look and found mild signs of it but recent inspections indicate that wasn't it.  They've moved on now and looked at my spine since I've been in several intense car accidents (not my fault, gotta look for positives) and have recently ruled that out but think they may have found a possible cause from those scans.  My next one is this coming Friday but I won't know the results for a week.  I've been dealing with this for 3 years now but the worst of it has been about a year and a half.

You may still want to check out the video for Part 2 because it  covers the international giveaway of the winning sunscreen!\n\nI've  been testing sunscreens for the better part of three years, trying to  find that elusive combo of next-gen organic (\"chemical\") filters and  elegant texture. I try to avoid drying alcohol and fragrance whenever  possible, and I have extremely sensitive eyes, so that colors a lot of  my reviews. I have combination skin (oily t-zone, especially in the summer, but my cheeks and chin are dry as hell) and I live in a very cold, dry climate (Northern Alberta)\n\n**THE WORST**\n\n***42) TONYMOLY BCDation Multi-Use Sun Oil SPF 50+/PA++++***\n\nFilters: Octinoxate, Homosalate, Octisalate, Uvinul A-PlusThis  utterly fails as a sunscreen- it's an oil that advertises needing \"just  one magic drop\" to provide sunscreen coverage, which is a dangerous  lie. You'd need at least one milliliter to get the coverage advertised,  and when I tried to put a full milliliter of oil on my face, the results  were... not pretty. Also has rose essential oil in it, and I hate rose  perfume.\n\n***41) LaRoche-Posay Anthelios XL Dry-Touch Gel Cream SPF 60/UVA-PF 20+***Filters: Homosalate, Octocrylene, Octisalate, Avobenzone, Mexoryl XL (0.5% Boooo!)This  was absolutely disgusting. Stank like poisonous robot farts, stung my  eyes unmercifully, pills everywhere so it's useless under makeup, and  worst of all it has a whitecast! There's so much silica in it (the  \"dry-touch\") that an all-chemical sunscreen actually has a whitecast.  Hilariously, Allure magazine voted it \"Best Chemical Sunscreen,\" proving  once and for all that those fuckers don't actually test the products  they hype. This belongs in hell, whence it came.\n\n***40) Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Suncream SPF 50+/PA++++***Filters: Tinosorb S, Uvinul A-PlusThis  was nicely moisturizing, no whitecast, didn't sting my eyes, but it did  BURN ALL OF MY FACE. I'm pretty sure it's the pine essential oil in it,  which is on me for not catching it on the ingredients list. It also  behaved really oddly with a makeup primer (the Milk makeup Hydrogrip),  which caused the sunscreen to peel off my face in a filmy, mebranous  layer. So weird.NOTE:  I'm not worried about this sunscreen and the rest of the 2020 releases  from Korea only having two filters, because one of them is Tinosorb S,  which works really well at low concentrations.\n\n***39) Canmake Mermaid Skin UV Gel SPF 50+/PA++++***Filters: Tinosorb S, Octinoxate, TiO2, Uvinul A-PlusGoes  on really nice, feels lightly moisturizing, plus makes for a great  makeup primer. Slight white cast. Then, midway through the day, it  causes a sweeping wave of dehydration that sucks every last drop of  moisture out of my face. I've scoured Reddit for reviews to find that  I'm not the only person who has this problem with it. As my skin is  naturally dry, this is intolerable. I actually bought a second bottle of  the stuff just to see if I'd gotten a bad batch the first time. Alas,  no.\n\n***38) Altruist Sunscreen SPF 30/UVA-PF 39***Filters: Avobenzone, Octisalate, Ensulizole, Octocrylene, Tinosorb S, Tinosorb A2B, Uvinul T-150This  may be a controversial opinion amongst sunscreen nerds, but FUCK THIS  SHIT. First impressions: slight whitecast, pills horribly, but at least  it doesn't sting my eyes, right? NO. 15-30 mins after applying it (if  you apply it anywhere higher on your face than your \\*chin\\*) it burrows  into your eyes and lays eggs. Then the eggs hatch. The eggs are made of  PAIN. I had to literally claw this off my face to get it to stop burning  my eyes. The only virtue of this sunscreen is that it's cheap.\n\n***37) Altruist Sunscreen SPF 50+/UVA-PF 54***Filters: Avobenzone, Octisalate, Ensulizole, Octocrylene, Tinosorb S, Tinosorb A2B, Uvinul T-150See  #38 for details. This is the same, but worse. I ranked it slightly  higher because it has higher protection and is also cheap. I had a hard  time using this up on my body because it pills there too. Blech.\n\n***36) Garnier Ombrelle Complete Lightweight Lotion SPF 60/UVA-PF 20+***Filters: Homosalate, Octocrylene, Octisalate, Avobenzone, Mexoryl XL, Mexoryl SXIt  stinks, it pills, it stings my eyes. Total chore to use it up, even on  my body. Ranked at the top of the Worst because it makes use of two  next-gen chemical filters, and it's cheap.\n\n**THE BAD**\n\n***35) Country&Stream Honey UV Water Gel SPF 50+/PA++++***Filters: ZnO, TiO2, Octinoxate, Uvinul A-Plus, Tinosorb SSticky,  and expensive for not very much (45 ml) and it's hard to get ahold of,  apparently even in Japan. The worst part, though, is the fragrance. I  assume it would smell like honey. I WAS WRONG. It reeks of lemon pledge,  and the smell does NOT go away. I don't want to smell like I'm cleaning  my floors.\n\n***34) Avene Very High Protection Cream (Fragrance-Free)***Filters: Tinosorb M, Tinosorb S, Uvasorb HEB, AvobenzoneDecent  texture, moisturizing, sinks into the skin easily. Stings my eyes  (avobenzone! Aughhh!) but the real issue is the whitecast. This has so  much Tinosorb M in it that the whitecast rivals that of an all-mineral  sunscreen. Gives me total undead vibes.\n\n***33) Vichy Ideal Soleil Dry-Touch Lotion SPF 60/UVA-PF 20+***Filters: Homosalate, Octocrylene, Octisalate, Avobenzone, Mexoryl XL (0.5% Boooo!)Vichy  is owned by L'Oreal Brands, (as are LaRoche-Posay and Garnier) and this  has the exact same formula as #41. However, there are some serious  differences between all three products in this review that have the same  formula. This version is better than the LRP because it's less stinky  and doesn't pill. It does, however, have an even stronger whitecast  (how??) and still stings my eyes. I'm grumpy with L'Oreal because they  hold the patents to the Mexoryl sunscreen filters, which are really  good- and yet they don't ever seem to use them, especially not at higher  concentrations. Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.\n\n***32) Innisfree Aqua Water Drop Sunscreen. SPF 50+/PA++++***Filters: Octinoxate, Homosalate, Octisalate, Uvinul A-Plus, Uvinul T-150I  initially purchased a version of this that was discontinued, so I got  the updated version, which is what I'm reviewing here. The OG version of  this sunscreen didn't have Octinoxate, which was rare for an asian  sunscreen. It also had some citrus extract, probably for fragrance  purposes, but it didn't irritate my skin, so whatever. This version put  Octinoxate in! They took out the Avobenzone, but then added a bunch of  stuff that stings my eyes. Plus there's a new fragrance that's really  strong. The texture of this sunscreen is nothing like what I'm used to  with Korean sunscreens- before it was greasy and sticky, now it's just  extra greasy. Reformulations are supposed to be an improvement,  Innisfree!\n\n***31) Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF(?)/PA(?)***Filters: Uvinul A-Plus, Uvinul T-150This  sunscreen probably has lower levels of effectiveness than what is  advertised because it is made in the same factory (NOWCOS) as the Purito  and Banobagi sunscreens (which come later in the rankings). However, I  would've given it a low rating anyway because of the fact that some  brain donor at Klairs decided the best thing to put into a sunscreen  would be a citrus essential oil. This is one of the stupidest things  ever. Why? Because citrus essential oils contain chemicals called  psoralens (or furanocoumarins) which absorb the suns UVA rays, go into  the cells of your skin, irreversibly bind to their DNA and KILL THEM,  leading to all manner of nasty complications including  phytophotodermatitis (google with a strong stomach) and melanoma.  MELANOMA. Sweet orange oil has \\*fewer\\* psoralens than bergamot oil, the  worst offender, but it still has them. Someone started a rumor that it  doesn't and I'd like to slap them silly. I can link sources if anyone  needs them. Anyway, just on the principle of \"don't put PHOTOTOXIC  CHEMICALS into something that is supposed to be sun-protective\" this is a  complete fail. It does have a nice texture, though, so maybe they'll  reformulate with no fragrance and more filters? We can but hope.\n\n***30) Bioderma Photoderm MAX Milk SPF 50+/UVA-PF 42***Filters: Avobenzone, Octocrylene, Tinosorb S, Tinosorb MAnother  potentially controversial opinion, but this stuff sucks. It's got great  protection, but so what? It burns my eyes like hellfire and it has a  whitecast, probably from the Tinosorb M.\n\n**THE MEH**\n\n***29) Garnier Ombrelle Face Anti-Shine Cream SPF 60/UVA-PF 20+***Filters: Homosalate, Octocrylene, Octisalate, Avobenzone, Mexoryl XL (0.5% Boooo!)This  is the third of the L'Oreal brand sunscreens with the exact same  formula, and definitely the best. Unlike #41 and #33, it actually does  what it advertises: mattifies. This sunscreen is amaaaaaazing for  mattifying and pore-blurring. It's better than most silicone primers  I've tried. The issues are, of course, the eye-stinging, the whitecast,  and the stink (this is the second stinkiest of the three). However, it  lies beautifully under makeup and doesn't pill at all. I wouldn't ever  recommend this as an everyday sunscreen, but if you wear makeup and need  to mattify certain areas like the T-zone, this would be perfect for  that. I found it to not be dehydrating, but it will accentuate any dry  or flaky patches of skin.\n\n***28) Derma Sun Lotion SPF 50/UVA-PF 16+***Filters: Tinosorb S Lite Aqua, Uvasorb HEB, Uvinul A-Plus, Uvinul T-150This  is a product of Denmark, and I thought because it had only 2nd gen  chemical filters it would be perfect. LOL NO. It still managed to sting  my eyes, though less so than other sunscreens. (Maybe the different  version of Tinosorb S? I know it irritates some peoples' skin...) The  main problem is that it is so shiny IT CAN BE SEEN FROM SPACE. Not  greasy, just shiny. Insanely so.\n\n***27) Ultrasun Face Anti-Aging Gel SPF 50+/UVA-PF 20/PA++++***Filters: Tinosorb S, Tinosorb M, Octisalate, Uvinul A-Plus, Uvinul T-150, TiO2Feels  nice when applied, but it has a whitecast, and while it's advertised as  water and sweat-resistant, it sweat right the hell off my face during a  very slow-moving nature walk. What the hell? It never dries down  completely. Also pretty expensive for just 50 mL.\n\n***26) Isehan Sunkiller Perfect Strong Moisture SPF 50+/PA++++***Filters: Octocrylene, Octinoxate, Uvinul A-PlusNo  whitecast, water-resistant, but really stung my eyes. I found the  texture to be very moisturizing and pleasant. Took a little long to dry  down. It is fragranced, but the scent is barely noticeable. My main  issue with this is that you only get 30 mL. If this were advertised as a  sunscreen specifically to travel with, okay, but that doesn't seem to  be the case. WHAT IS THIS, A SUNSCREEN FOR ANTS???\n\n***25) Bioderma Photoderm MAX Family Milk SPF 50+/UVA-PF 42***Filters: Homosalate, Uvinul A-Plus, Tinosorb S, OctisalateA  much-improved version of the regular Photoderm MAX. This has no  whitecast at all! It does however, burn my eyes like crazy (Homosalate,  grr!), is ridiculously shiny, and it devours any makeup, so it's useless  on the face for me. What I actually recommend this for is use outdoors  on the body. It doesn't sweat off easily, and the excessive shine looks  great on my collarbones and on top of my boobs, on my legs, etc. Also it  comes in a gigantic 250 mL tube, so the price works out to be pretty  good. Great body sunscreen \\*especially\\* for people with dark skin.\n\n***24) Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel SPF 50+/PA++++***Filters: Homosalate, Tinosorb S, Tinosorb M, Octisalate, Uvinul A-Plus, Polysilicone-15I  had such high hopes for this! No whitecast, and it's very moisturizing,  what with the EIGHT molecular weights of HA. Unfortunately, the  inclusion of Homosalate guaranteed that it would burn my eyes, which it  did. Le sigh. Also, while my skin can handle low-molecular-weight HA, I  know a lot of people have trouble with it clogging their pores and  causing skin irritation, so be wary of that.\n\n***23) Anglamark Sun Face SPF 50/UVA-PF 16+***Filters: Tinosorb S, Uvinul A-Plus, Uvinul T-150Looks  great on paper, what with the all-next-gen filters. It didn't burn my  eyes and it doesn't have a whitecast! Yayyy! Then what's the problem?  The texture. It's not the worst in the world, but I just didn't like it.  It never really dried down and I could feel it sitting on my skin.\n\n***22) SVR Cicavit+ Creme SPF 50+/UVA-PF 20+***Filters: Tinosorb S Lite Aqua, Uvinul A-Plus, Uvinul T-150, Uvasorb HEB.Another  European sunscreen with all next-gen chemical filters that I thought  would be perfect. No whitecast or eye stinging. I didn't like the  texture, though- it just wasn't right. Plus there's a weird smell to  this. Some people have compared it to almonds, but to me it smells like  \"generic cleaning product sweetness,\" which I definitely do not want to  be smelling all day. Plus you only get 40 mL and it's not the cheapest.\n\n***21) Isehan Kiss Me Mommy! UV Aqua Milk SPF 50+/PA++++***Filters: Tinosorb S, Octinoxate, Uvinul A-PlusIt's  waterproof, doesn't have a white cast, and didn't sting my eyes despite  the octinoxate (This only seems to be a thing with Japanese  sunscreens). However, the texture was kind of unpleasant, much heavier  and greasier than the Japanese sunscreens I'm used to.\n\n***20) Aderma Protect Cream Very High Protection (Fragrance-Free) SPF 50+/UVA-PF 20+***Filters: Tinosorb S, Tinosorb M, Avobenzone, Uvinul A-PlusYET  ANOTHER Euro sunscreen with pretty good filters that didn't quite hit  the mark. There's a very, very faint whitecast that goes away quickly,  plus minimal eye stinging that also faded away. It leaves a nice, dewy  sheen on the skin rather than sitting there heavily. But at 40 mL, it's  another sunscreen for ants, and at 65 cents (USD) per milliliter, it's  the most expensive sunscreen on this list! Aderma makes value-sized  sunscreens, but not for this one. Weird.\n\n***19) Verdio UV Moisture Gel SPF 50+/PA++++***Filters: Tinosorb S, Octinoxate, Uvinul A-Plus, Uvinul T-150, TiO2Decent,  but kind of greasy/heavy in terms of texture. It's water and  sweat-resistant, not -proof. Very faint whitecast. Didn't sting eyes.  Just wish I liked the finish of it better.\n\n***18) New Layer High Performance Sunscreen SPF 50+/UVA-PF 20+***Filters: Tinosorb S, Uvasorb HEB, Ensulizole, Octisalate, Uvinul A-Plus, Uvinul T-150I  pretty much loved this sunscreen with one reservation: the fragrance.  It has a very strong \"refreshing sea-breeze\" scent that I find  overpowering and it doesn't go away, either. Aside from that, it's got  great filters, no whitecast, is waterproof, doesn't sting my eyes, and  has a very light, pleasant texture. Seems expensive at first glance, but  since you get 200 mL, it works out to a pretty low price. I BEG OF YOU,  NEW LAYER, MAKE A FRAGRANCE-FREE VERSION AND I WILL PUT IT IN THE TOP 5  OF MY NEXT LIST.**THE GOOD**\n\n***17) Biore UV Kids' Milk (old version) SPF 50+/PA++++***Filters: Octinoxate, Tinosorb S, Uvinul A-Plus, Uvinul T-150It's  got pretty much everything: no whitecast, no eye stinging (again  despite the Octinoxate), a beautiful texture, waterproof, and you get a  ton of product (90 mL). Why is it ranked so low? BECAUSE IT'S BEEN  DISCONTINUED. SOB. Biore has replaced this with an all-mineral version.  BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! The old version (just discontinued this year) is still  available around the internet, so that's why it's on the list at all.  Old bottles will be good for at least another year, so get your hands on  it before it disappears forever.\n\n***16) Purito Green Level Centella Unscented Sun SPF 16-19(?)/PA+++(?)***Filters: Uvinul A-Plus, Uvinul T-150Everyone  in this subreddit has probably heard the story: sunscreen with no  whitecast, no eye-stingery, no silicones, great texture, high protection  from only next-gen chemical filters turns out to be too good to be  true, internet erupts. The original ranking for this sunscreen was at  #6, in the \"Great\" tier of products for all of the reasons stated above.  Controversy time: I STILL THINK THIS PRODUCT HAS VALUE. Yes, it sucks  that the SPF is much lower than originally rated (great filters, but the  concentration is too low), but that doesn't mean people should throw  out any remaining tubes. This sunscreen was never advertised to be  waterproof or sweatproof, or for use in outdoor sports. I always used it  for when I'm mostly indoors and go out for just a few minutes at a  time. It still works for that. SPF 16 isn't nothing. It's 93% UV  coverage. The texture was the reason for the high rating and it's why  this sunscreen is still good enough to be in the Good tier.  Dermatologists have a saying that \"the best sunscreen is the one you'll  actually wear,\" and this one is one of the most wearable. So my  recommendation is use it as a light-coverage, indoor sunscreen (perfect  for winter time!) and use something stronger if you'll be out in the sun  at peak times doing strenuous physical activity. Or, if you have a  powerful face sunscreen that stings your eyes, this would be perfect for  around the eye area. I'll be curious to see what Purito does going  forward!\n\n***15) Banobagi Milk Thistle Repair Sunscreen SPF(?)/PA(?)***Filters: Uvinul A-Plus, Uvinul T-150Same  as #16 (made in the same factory as the Purito and the Klairs) except  that I find the texture to be even better. It's wonderfully light,  moisturizing, and soothing on the skin. I wore this on my (indoor!)  wedding day and it sits beautifully under makeup. Don't throw it out if  you've got it- just be wary of using it outdoors!\n\n***14) Omuchi's Nothing to Hide Sunscreen SPF 50/UVA-PF 16***Filters: Tinosorb S, Neo Heliopan APA  product of Finland, this would be great for anyone who lives in the EU  and wants something as cheap and abundant (100 mL tubes) as that  Altrusist garbage. The filters here are first-class, both  broad-spectrum, and this has no whitecast and doesn't sting my eyes. The  ingredients list is heavy on the emollients: shea butter, cocoa butter,  grapeseed oil. Surprisingly, this was not greasy, and had more of a  satin finish. It's a bit heavy, but not too bad. Not the easiest to get  ahold of outside the EU.\n\n***13) Garnier Ombrelle Face Ultra-Light Cream SPF 60/UVA 20+***Filters: TiO2, Avobenzone, Octocrylene, Mexoryl XL, Mexoryl SXA  western (Canadian) sunscreen that doesn't suck! Hallelujah! Despite the  Avobenzone, it was only minimally stinging to my eyes, and despite the  TiO2, the whitecast was minimal. What amazed me was 1) how moisturizing  it is. This sunscreen is packed with glycerin, which is amazing for the  wintertime, but can make your nose and forehead shiny by the end of the  day unless you mattify, and 2) it's the only sunscreen I've ever seen  where L'Oreal uses both Mexoryl filters at decent concentrations,  meaning the UVA protection is stellar. Check this out if you want good  protection that comes with a hefty dose of healing, protective moisture.\n\n***12) Hyggee Relief Sun Moisturizer SPF 50+/PA++++***Filters: Tinosorb S, Uvinul A-PlusAs  stated previously, I'm not unnerved by this latest crop of Korean  sunscreens with only two filters, because one of them, Tinosorb S, works  really well at very low concentrations. This is a pretty good  sunscreen: no whitecast, no eyestinging, moisturizing. The only  downsides are that it's pricey and a bit hard to find, and it sits more  heavily on the skin that I would usually like. Turns out it's very nice  for the winter, though.\n\n***11) EVY Sunscreen Mousse SPF 50/UVA-PF 16+***Filters: Octocrylene, Avobenzone, Tinosorb S, Uvinul A-Plus, Uvinul T-150This  is an aerosolized mousse from Sweden, with a very light texture and no  whitecast. Also highly water-resistant. The problems are two-fold: the  vast quantities of Avobenzone sting my eyes like nobody's business and  it's ludicrously hard to purchase outside the EU. I found two websites  that ship outside the EU and one of them mandates that you purchase SIX  TUBES at a time. No thank you, as this stuff isn't cheap.\n\n***10) Frezyderm Second Skin Sunscreen SPF 50+/UVA-PF 20+***Filters: Octocrylene, Octinoxate, Octisalate, Uvinul A-PlusThis  sunscreen does sting my eyes, though not too badly. It's texture,  though, is nothing short of amazing. It's like a gorgeous silicone  primer that gives a velvety feel to the skin. Did I mention that it goes  on TRANSLUCENT??? Because it does. Comes out of the pump with a very  faint yellow tint that blends away. If you have dark skin and want a  sunscreen that absolutely won't look ashy on you, this is the one! It's  also water-resistant. Made for a day on the beach in Greece. The  packaging isn't the most environmentally-friendly and it's a bit pricey,  but worth it for the texture and lack of whitecast.\n\n***9) Uriage Bariesun Fragrance-Free SPF 50+/UVA-PA 20+***Filters: Uvinul A-Plus, Uvinul T-150, Tinosorb S, Octinoxate, OctisalateI  really wanted to love this- it has a texture closer to a Japanese or  Korean sunscreen than a French one. No whitecast, goes on light and  airy, pleasantly moisturizing. Unfortunately it has Octinoxate in  concentration high enough to give me the eye-stabs, so it's a no-go.  Freaking tragic.\n\n***8) Evermere Cosmetics Moist-Tec UV Gel SPF 50+/PA++++***Filters: Uvinul A-Plus, OctinoxateI'll  say it right away: this sunscreen has the best texture I've ever  encountered. Truly beautiful, it manages to be light but also deeply  moisturizing. The best analogy I have is that this is like little kawaii  raindrops bursting all over your face while they sing happy little  songs of moisturization. Unfortunately, the relationship had to end in  tears, literally, because it's got a lot of Octinoxate in it, which  makes me cry. I almost don't care. Maybe I should use this plus the  Purito for my eyes? Anyway, amazing texture aside, it has no whitecast,  but it's also very difficult to purchase outside Japan. Totally worth  it, though.\n\n***7) Keep Cool and Soothe Bamboo Sun Essence SPF 50+/PA++++***Filters: Uvinul A-Plus, Tinosorb SAnother  really good sunscreen from the class of 2020, this sunscreen has a  lovely, if slightly heavy texture. The birch juice and other botanicals  do contribute to a soothing sensation on the skin. Only real downsides  are the price and the packaging. Because of the way the tube is  structured, it can't stand up without falling over every 5 minutes,  which I found extremely annoying. Otherwise, it's a solid choice- as  long as you don't try to use it for strenuous outdoor activities.\n\n***6) Anessa Perfect UV Mild Milk (2020 version) SPF 50+/PA++++***Filters: ZnO, TiO2, Tinosorb S, Uvinul A-Plus, Uvinul T-150Now  here's a sunscreen that absolutely \\*is\\* rated for outdoor sports! This  does not budge throughout the day and it definitely requires a 2-step  cleanse at night to take it off. It has a gorgeous finish, with a  satin-matte texture and a noticeable pore-blurring effect on the skin.  Doesn't dry out my skin any further, but will accentuate any dry or  flaky patches. It does have a whitecast that \\*almost\\* entirely  disappears, but not completely. I love it under makeup because it  mattifies my shiny t-zone and blurs the look of my pores. It is really  freakin expensive, though, and that plus the whitecast made me like it,  but not love it.\n\n**THE GREAT**\n\n***5) Ultrasun Extreme Sensitive Skin SPF 50+/UVA-PF 20/PA++++***Filters: Tinosorb S, Tinosorb M, Octisalate, Uvinul A-Plus, Uvinul T-150, TiO2Apparently  this sunscreen is made for use on the body rather than the face, but I  didn't notice. It has a similar texture (light with a hint of greasiness  that dries down) to the other Ultrasun product I reviewed, but unlike  that one, this doesn't sweat off! It's great for outdoor activities!  Works well under makeup, too. The only downside is a light whitecast  from the Tinosorb M and TiO2, but it dies down almost completely after a  few minutes. Plus, you get 100 mL for less than half the price of the  Ultrasun Face Anti-Aging Gel, which is 50 mL. TWICE THE PRODUCT FOR HALF  THE PRICE.\n\n***4) Verdio UV Moisture Milk SPF 50+/PA++++***Filters: ZnO, TiO2, Uvinul A-Plus, OctinoxateYes  yes, this is another sunscreen for ants (36 mL) but hear me out! It's  rated for outdoor sports, and unless you're an athlete, you won't need  to use this as often as you would a regular sunscreen. I like this one  for traveling as well, because it's so small and the tube is squared off  at both ends so it fits into a bag really easily. It doesn't sting my  eyes, despite the Octinoxate, and has a whitecast that disappears so  quickly I always think I hallucinated it. It's lightly moisturizing and  gives the skin a pleasant glow. It's true strength, though is in how  water- and sweat-proof this is. I used it to spend two days working  outdoors in 43 C weather with like, 8 million percent humidity and it  did not budge \\*at all.\\* It helped keep my makeup on all day, and I'm  pretty sure that the combination of soothing botanicals calmed down some  acne that I had. Also, this is like, 10 \\*Canadian\\* dollars right now on  dokodemo, so it's something that could be purchased in bulk. I'm on my  second bottle of the stuff because I like traveling with it so much.\n\n***3) Rohto Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Milk SPF 50+/PA++++***Filters: ZnO, Uvinul A-Plus, OctinoxateIt's  a classic for a reason! I love this sunscreen so very much that I've  followed it across multiple repackagings. It's moisturizing, but not  greasy, has no whitecast, despite its zinc-based formula, and no  eye-stinging despite the Octinoxate. I find it to be pretty water and  sweat-resistant, too (it's rated for outdoor sports). It's only 40 mL,  but because it's so ubiquitous and cheap (even in the benighted west)  that I don't really care. Some people have expressed concern about the  UVA protection because of the way this sunscreen photographs with one of  those UV cameras. HOWEVER, the primary filter here (highest  concentration) is zinc oxide, which in addition to covering the entire  UV spectrum DOES NOT PHOTOGRAPH WELL UNDER SUNSCREEN CAMERAS. No mineral  filters do. According to Lab Muffin Beauty Science, the only thing  those cameras can reliably show is where on your face the sunscreen is.  So use this without fear! Or at least, without excessive fear.\n\n***2) P20 Suncare for Kids SPF 50+/UVA-PF 50+***Filters: Tinosorb S, Tinosorb M, Tinosorb A2B, Uvinul A-Plus, Uvinul T-150, OctisalateWow,  what a combination of filters. This is the only truly high-protection  sunscreen on the list that doesn't suck. Not sure what dark wizard  skills the formulators used to make something so stuffed with filters  that its UVA score jumps the 50 hurdle, that \\*also\\* has a nice texture,  but they did. It has a faint whitecast that disappears almost  immediately, and doesn't sting my eyes. Plus it's designed to be worn  for 10 hours at a stretch, or 3 hours in the water. It goes on a little  greasy and heavy, but that dies down too and leaves a beautiful, dewy  sheen on the skin. It's kind of hard to get outside the EU; I used  Amazon UK. I'm definitely going to repurchase this for days when I'm  recovering from a chemical peel.And now we come to...\n\n**THE BEST**\n\n***1)*** ***B-LAB i am sorry just suncream SPF 50+/PA++++***Filters: Tinosorb S, Uvinul A-PlusA dark horse contender, I just spotted this on [Jolse.com](https://jolse.com/)  and thought it looked really nice. Boy was I right. This has a texture  that comes pretty close to the Evermere sunscreen, but it doesn't sting  my eyes! No whitecast, either. It's very light and elegant, but also  moisturizing and glowy, WHILE ALSO MATTIFYING OILY AREAS. Yes, that's  right, this sunscreen is a genuine C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER, perfectly  evening out combination skin. I love it under makeup, I love it by  itself. It sparks joy. Would I use this for outdoor sports? No. But I  don't do outdoor sports every day, or even most days. Plus, it's almost  always on sale on Jolse. I paid $7 for it. My recommendation is to try  it once, and if you like it (and I suspect you will) to wait for a sale  and buy it in bulk. This is the \\*perfect\\* everyday sunscreen, and thus,  it gets the crown.\n\nI'm  giving away a tube of this wonderful stuff, and if you're interested,  just go to Part 2 (linked in the description bar of this video) the  instructions are there. This is an international giveaway, so no matter  where you live, I'll find a way to get it to you! Thanks for  reading/watching!",

By the end of the tournament (6 hours later), I was laying down in my UPF tent with my eyes closed with tears streaming down my face (from irritation and actual tears) just praying for my boyfriend to lose so I could go home and wash my face. The burning was awful. I still have probably 1.5 tubes left of this demon cream and I'm upset about it.\n\nWe also have the same favorite! I bought my first tube for like $5 on Jolse just to try it out after I didn't really like the Purito one and I was amazed. I then went and bought 4 more tubes the next time it was on sale. I'm really surprised more people aren't talking about it. \n\nI really enjoyed the videos! You're really funny and I now have new outdoor sunscreens to try!",

I haven't worn it with makeup because of masks though but it wears well with all my moisturizers once i let them settle and wash my hands of any leftover lotion residue.\n\nI have more normal skin in winter, maybe leaning oily still.

I'll still go to my grave hating essential oils on my face lol\n\nThanks for taking one for the sensitive-dry-skin team! My personal favorites are the EltaMD UV Replenish, EltaMD UV Physical, TROIAREUKE ACSEN UV Protector Sun Essence, and Shigaisen Yohou Non-Chemical UV Cream SPF50+ PA++++. None of these ever irritate my skin no matter how damaged my skin is, although the Japanese one has the slightest white cast.",

When I see orange oil I think about needing to dust and polish my dressers and nightstand, not slap it on my face. To list that it has natural ingredients as a marketing quirk like they do with other products to allow for pictures of the ingredients shown on the product or website, or maybe to strip oils intentionally or something to make it feel less greasy on the skin?\n\nWhat do you think of Mexoryl XL? Seems it's only not approved in the US, but is approved in every other major market. Is that potentially just trade protectionism because L'Oreal is French?",

It has new gen filters, doesnt burn my eyes, a tolerable texture, marketed as waterproof, difficult to remove (so it's definitely suitable for outdoor activities) but unfortunately the scent is so strong it hurts. It smells a bit like a cross of the Black Opium fragrance and the Alien fragrance so if you like it and don't mind fragrance in your face, go for it. Otherwise the scent is insufferable. The first time I wore it, it burned my face, probably because of the fragrance so beware. The 2nd and 3rd time I wore this in my face my skin didn't react and I didn't break out.

If not shaken it should be separated. I measure everything else by heart but don’t over do the oil too much. I usually put this in my hair and leave it for 45 minutes. I do no oiling after this in my hair routine because this will leave your hair pretty oily as is. It works for me and I hope this also works for you. :) ",

    "body": "Warning this will be a long post, it has everything I've learnt in the past couple of years from hair growth, to styling, to weightloss, to nervous system regulation and more.\n\nI'm in my early 30s, I have 3B hair, tall, two years ago I was obese, prediabetic, I had anxiety problems, now I'm just a tall \\[seemingly ;) \\] effortlessly pretty black girl and I want all my beauties on here to have my beauty secrets.\n\nTopics discussed:\n\n* Haircare\n* Style\n* Makeup \n* Teeth\n* Skincare\n* Weight loss vs Fat loss\n* Healthy Fat loss\n* Body Recomposition \n* Inflammation\n* Gut Health\n* How to lower androgen/testosterone levels\n* Nervous System Regulation/Stress Management \n* Tea Cycling\n* Seed Cycling \n\n# Hair\n\nI have PCOS so it affects my hair growth and causes hirsutism, basically male patterened facial hair and male patterned baldness.\n\n**Hair Growth:** Here is the true secret sauce to hair growth, stimulating your scalp. I do daily scalp massages with a bamboo brush (even the bristles are made of rounded bamboo) very gentle. This is the one I use: [Golab Beauty](https://golabbeauty.com/products/organic-bamboo-scalp-massager-hair-brush)  I do short strokes which prevents any tangles. Morning and Night. I then go in with a scalp serum, I use The Oui scalp serum but it costs a pretty penny. In the first yearish I used (The 'Ordinary' Haircare Growth Set Multi-Peptide Serum For Hair Density) which worked wonders and was cost effective. At nights I seal with any scalp oil that has rosemary oil. Sadly Mielle's formula no longer works for me, but As I Am rosemary oil has been working, I also like the Camille Rose Rosemary Oil Strengthening Hair and Scalp Drops. For Washing my hair I suffer from sebaceous dermatitis which causes scaliness. Paradoxically my scalp is so oily which is what triggers the ezcema and develops the dry patches. Reversing my PCOS symptoms fixed this but what also helped was the Nizoral shampoo with 1% Ketoconazole. It's harsh so I do it once to twice a month at most and I always follow up with a moisturizing shampoo, and of course finish with a wash out conditioner & leave in conditioner.\n\n**Hair Retention:** This is the info we all know about preventing breakage but I'll include just in case. Hair growth happens in the scalp like said before but to retain that growth it's important to wear protective hairstyles (especially while asleep), a silk/satin bonnet or wrap, silk/satin pillowcase, do not let your hair air dry at night. There is debate about this but I've seen hair specialists and scientists say our hair is especially fragile when wet (especially curly/kinky hair). Therefore, we are much more prone to snags and breakage while our hair is wet. So going to bed make sure your hair is dried. If you're air drying your hair during the day try not to touch it too much  - as little manipulation as possible. Personally choose to diffuse/blow dry my hair and this has prevented most of the breakage I was previously experiencing. Lastly, moisturize and oil your ends. I won't pretend like I know which order is best or even if it's important but I've found that using hair moisturizer/diluted leave in conditioner then hair oil works best for me.\n\n**Hirsutism/Facial Hair:** Spearmint essential oil. I add 1-2 drops of the oil to my moisturizer each time I put on my moisturizer and it helped A LOT with reducing my facial hair. I also drink a lot of spearmint tea. Spearmint specifically has been proven to lower androgen/testosterone levels which is why it helps. I also took supplements which I'll include at the end because they served multiple purposes. Be sure not to add the oil to the entire bottle because that will ruin your moisturizer's formula. Just add the drops in your palm/finger tips and mix in your face cream each time you moisturize your jawline, chin, underneck. Also, do this after moisturizing the upper part of your face without the oil because it's harsh and the scent can be irritating to your eye area.\n\n**Body hair:** Personally I sugar wax my arms and legs, the hair has grown back so thin now. I make it myself and follow tutorials from abetweene on youtube.\n\n**Hair colour/Hairstyle:** This will depend on your face shape and color season. I'm a dark winter colour season and I have a heart face shape. I used the Dressika app to discover my color season before I could afford to get myself professionally assessed and I got the same results. Just be sure to use natural lighting, like by a window. Once you have your colour season you can choose hair colours that work best for you (although natural almost always works best). For my hairstyle I try to choose styles that compliment my heart shaped face. I used the youtube channel Dear Peachie to help me with figuring this out.\n\n# Style\n\nI think most of us know about **Kibbe and colour seasons.** This was how I upgraded my wardrobe. I'm a soft dramatic so I wear things that work for my tall height and accentuate my waist.\n\nThis was the game changer with colour seasons. Most of us know about our true seasons, but it can get restrictive. Sister seasons and colour dissonance is also helpful to know.\n\nMy colour season is dark winter, so my sister seasons would be dark autumn and true winter. Thid gives me more wiggle room to style myself.\n\n**Dissonance** are colours that are outside your true season and your sister seasons, you sprinke this in to add interest. Think of an outfit that is extremely matchy and cohesive but has that one accessory or item that stands out and adds interest. It's really fun in art and in fashion.\n\nFor my **shoes** I've started wearing dancing heels which help my flat feet lol and look stylish. Heel insoles help too, as well as the product Shoe Gummi. I still can't last more than 2, 3 hours at most but it's definitely bearable compared to before.\n\nMatching pajamas and loungewear. You just feel so luxurious dressing up at home and they can (should) be comfy :)\n\n**Accessories:**\n\n* I wear glasses that work with my heart shaped face.\n* I have a neutral leaning warm undertone so I wear gold jewelry, if I wear pearls or other gem stones I mix in gold to provide more harmony with my skin.\n* Perfume, wear what works with your body chemistry. Some smell delictable on people I know and icky on me, and vice versa. Wear what works for you.\n* Nails, press ons. So convenient, so cheap.\n* Hair accessories, bows, barretes, clips, scrunchies, a ribbon, you could be wearing jeans and a t shirt but a simple hair accessory upgrades the look automatically.\n\n# Makeup\n\nI used the youtube channel Dear Peachie to help me with finding eye looks, brows, blush placement for my face shape\n\nI have a low visual weight face and I am a romantic ingenue, because of this I go for more subtle looks that emphasis two facial features maximum at a time (eyes, lips, cheeks).\n\nDon't get me wrong I love glam bold makeup but soft and subtle makes me glow, I turn heads when my makeup is done like this.\n\n# Teeth\n\n* Wax free floss (Cocofloss $10 expensive but I love it 😅, Burst black floss, Moon graphite floss, Twice floss, Dr. Jen’s silk floss)\n* Oil pulling (coconut oil with clove & tea tree oil, or Guru Nanda oil pulling product)\n* Brush teeth\n* Tongue scraper (not everyday, couple of times a week and not too hard)\n* Alcohol free mouthwash (TheraBreath)\n* More so related to my lip area but I try to use wrinkle preventing straws or when I do use regular straws, I place it on the side of my mouth. The reason this works is because puckering the lips excessively causes smokers lines/wrinkles around the mouth. \n\n# Skin\n\nSkincare. This was something that took me a while to work on because of my PCOS, age, weight and etc.\n\n**Facial Care:** The basics includes chemical exfoliation, retinol, moisturizer/recover. I cycle my nightly skincare routine with this in mind and always keep the same morning routine. Mornings look like this (Jojoba oil to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, vitamin c/peptide serum, moisturizer with a drop or two of glycerin, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, finish with sunscreen).\n\nMy nights I alternate these routines in this order\n\nNight 1 - Chemical Exfoliation (Oil cleanser to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, glycolic/lactic acid, moisturizer with a drop or two of glycerin, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, castor oil on lashes and brows)\n\nNight 2 - Retinol (Oil cleanser to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, retinol, moisturizer, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, castor oil on lashes and brows)\n\nNight 3 - Moisturizer/Recovery (Oil cleanser to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, retinol, moisturizer with a drop or two of glycerin, rosehip oil as sealant on entire face, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, castor oil on lashes and brows)\n\n*Repeat Night 1 - 3 (sometimes I need more days to recover if my skin is sensitive or acting up, do what works for you personally)*\n\nOther things that I've done/used to help: red light therapy (helps with both hair growth, so I use it on my scalp, and with stretch marks so I use it on my face and body), Microcurrent device (helps with collagen production and stretchmarks) - I use the brand NuFace & NuBody, Volufiline (a skin serum I mix with eye cream that helps with hollowness under the eyes, Kigelia Africana Skin Cream (I use the brand Maelys B-Perky which contains this ingredient and helped to tighten my chest area and my loose skin on the area),  face yoga and myo fascia face massage, these help with the tautness of my face (basically everything else helps with wrinkles, these exercises and the microcurrent helps and prevents, sagging especially jowls). I follow tutorials I search for from youtube.\n\n**Body Care:** Similar to facial care body care includes exfoliation, retinol, moisturizer/recover\n\nNight 1 - Physical Exfoliation (Dry brush/Body Scrub, Hydrating lotion with a few drops of glycerin, rosehip oil as sealant on entire body)\n\nNight 2 - Retinol (Jojoba oil to help while I use my gua sha, retinol body wash, retinol body lotion)\n\nNight 3 - Moisturizer/Recovery (Jojoba oil to help while I use my gua sha, Hydrating lotion with a few drops of glycerin, rosehip oil as sealant on entire body)\n\n*Again, repeat Night 1 - 3 use more days for recovery if needed*\n\n**Stretch marks/loose skin:** Whether due to weight gain, pregnancy, etc. we can't ever truly get rid of loose skin or stretch marks but moisturizing the skin and derma rolling can help with the appearance. Especially derma rolling. Do NOT derma roll while pregnant but you can do so after when you’ve recovered and talk to your doctor (if you've had a c section you have to wait before derma rolling). I used this video as motivation [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChG8aSvEU6A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChG8aSvEU6A)\n\nFor the body I never went beyond 1.5mm it worked for my deepest stretch marks. If this is too aggressive 1.0mm still works just as well. Make sure you use 70% alcohol as this is what experts say is better at disinfecting. It has more water, which helps it to dissolve more slowly, penetrate cells, and kill bacteria. The disinfecting power of rubbing alcohol drops at concentrations higher than 80%-85%. Make sure you disinfect the derma roller before and after use, and make sure you disinfect your area of contact before rolling as well. Do not do heavy workouts workout or sweat inducing activities for at least 3 days after and avoid harsh products.\n\nI started derma rolling while working on losing weight (at the beginning of my journey while still obese) and continued a year after losing 130lbs. Derma rolling works by causing micro tears, the skin heals the area and in the process of doing so develops more collagen - leading to thicker skin, lighter stretch marks and tighter skin. Since I did this before losing the weight it helped my skin adapt a lot. I won't pretend like I have 0 loose skin or stretch marks but it's barely visible. Someone has to be intimately close to notice. Obviously genetics, how slowly you lose the weight, diet, and moisturizing the skin helps but my PCOS contributed to low collagen (thin skin) and so the derma rolling really helped.\n\n# Weight loss vs Fat loss\n\n**Tons of info here but I promise if you read through it helps to know this stuff.**\n\nWeightloss comes down to calories in versus calories out. I know that's rudely simpliflied and not that easy, but it truly is the answer to **weightloss** (which may be fat, water, or muscle). This is why people can eat barely nothing, lose weight but their shape stays the same (basically skinny fat). It's also why fasting or going low carb works so fast (water weight is the first to go).\n\nFatloss on the other hand is more complicated. This involves our TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure).\n\nTDEE includes: Resting/Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), Metabolic Equivalent of Task or Exercise activity thermogenesis  (EAT), Non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), Thermic Effect of Food (TEF), and Adaptive Thermogenesis (AT).\n\n**BMR (\\~70% daily energy)** the energy taken to exist, so tasks like breathing. Your sex, body composition (muscle to fat ratio), age, and genetics play a role in this  \n**EAT (\\~5% daily energy)** the energy taken for exercise weight lifting, swimming, high intensity walks, etc.  \n**NEAT (\\~15% daily energy)** the energy taken for non exercise movements like walking, fidgeting, showering, standing, etc  \n**TEF (\\~10% daily energy depending on the macronutrients of your meal)** the energy taken to digest, protein has the highest TEF of all the macronutrients, Carbs have a TEF of around 5-10%, while Fats have the lowest TEF, around 0-3%.\n\n**Adaptive Thermogenesis (AT)** is the changes in energy expenditure (energy used) that occur in response to changes in energy balance. For example when you eat more food than you need, your body may increase energy expenditure to prevent weight gain eg. move more, eat less the next day, etc.. On the other hand, when you eat less food than you need, your body may decrease energy expenditure to conserve energy and prevent weight loss eg. less movement, eat more the next day.\n\nOther things that affect AT include diet composition (eg high/low protein, high/low carb, calorie dense foods, etc), physical activity (eg. weights vs. cardio), and environmental factors such as temperature and altitude.\n\nThings that influence AT can make weight management challenging, as it can lead to plateaus or rebounds in weight loss efforts. This is why lack of sleep, hormonal issues, aging, etc. makes weightloss harder.\n\n*Here is a clearer example of this*\n\nThings that affect calories in:\n\n* 8-9 Hours of sleep (Maintains metabolic homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, hormonal processes). Compromised sleep lead to:\n   * Increased Gherlin (hunger hormone - feeling hungrier & therefor eating more)\n   * Decreased Leptin (sensation of satiety - needing to eat more to feel full)\n* Insulin resistance: This is when the cells in your muscles, fat, and liver don't respond well to insulin and can't easily take up glucose from your blood. This results in excessive sugar in the blood & as a result the body produces more insulin in order to try to help the cells obtain the energy from glucose. This leads to weight gain as the insulin increases hunger. Also, since the body is insulin resistant, the excess glucose is converted to fat for long-term storage.\n   * Things that can cause insulin resistance: PCOS, Inactivity/sedentary lifestyle, family history of diabetes, gestational diabetes, hypertension, alcohol abuse, poor sleep habits, high cholesterol levels, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, high bodyweight, acromegaly\n\nThings that affect calories out:\n\n* Body Composition (Fat to muscle ratio) \n* Gut health\n* Compromised sleep affects our energy levels which leads to\n   * Decreased NEAT (Non exercise activity thermogenesis)\n* Hypothyroidism (lowered levels of T3 and T4)\n   * Thyroid hormones T3 and T4 affects every cell and all the organs in your body by regulating the rate at which your body uses calories/energy which is known as our bmr, meaning this affects your metabolic rate.\n* Too few calories lowers daily NEAT\n   * By eating below your BMI (calories needed to perform basic biological processes), your body makes up for this through energy conservation by lowering your NEAT (non exercise activity thermogenesis). Basically you lack the energy to perform your normal daily activities. This also affects your body composition and cardio health as you become sedentary (stop moving as much).\n\n# Healthy Fat loss\n\nSo to lose fat in a healthy way you need to:\n\n1. Get enough sleep (8-9 hours per night)\n2. **Manage your stress levels/nervous system regulation**\n3. **Look after your gut health**\n4. **Manage inflammation**\n5. Increase your daily steps (8-10k per day)\n6. **Weight lift**\n7. **Eat high protein (protein takes the most amount of energy to digest).**\n8. **Manage your insulin resistence**\n9. **Eat in a caloric deficit (make sure your calories in do not exceed calories out).**\n\nFuther information about the bold items in the list is included below. Also, I know this all seems overwhelming but keep in mind you are creating a lifestyle change. This is not a quick fix. \n\nTo **manage your insulin resistance** (info from the book Glucose Goddess by Jessie Inchauspé):\n\n* Eat within an hour of waking up\n* Protein with breakfast\n* Tablespoon of apple cider vinegar before each meal (diluted in a glass of water)\n* Eat foods in this order, veggies -> protein -> fat -> starches -> carbs -> sugar\n* Never eat sweets/dessert/carbs on an empty stomach (dessert after dinner)\n* Keep refined carbs and added sugar at a minimum.\n* Minimize alcohol intake\n* Try to minimize sodas, fruit juice and sweet drinks (this is because there is no fiber to help with the glucose spike or at least try to have these drinks after eating something fiberous)\n* Only eat fruit whole, not transformed eg. eat the orange instead of having the orange juice, again fiber makes a world of a difference\n* Put clothing on your carbs. Eg. have protein/fats/fiber with your carbs\n* A short walk after carb heavy meals\n* Fasting - this is controversial and I should add a disclaimer, if you in any way shape or form have or had an eating disorder, especially restrictive eating, I highly recommend against fasting. Intermittent fasting has a lot of studies out there that were done on men. The book Fast Like a Girl by Dr. Mindy Pelz includes a nuanced view of fasting that takes into account our hormones and our monthly cycle. She also has a free app 'Fast like a girl', you log your period and it tells you how long to fast. However, bioindividuality is key here, genetics, etc. Please if you are considering fasting make sure you get bloodwork done first. Manage your electrolyte levels, do not neglect iron and protein levels. Personally, I prefer using the other methods since fasting can also inadvertently worsens insulin resistence due to increased stress/cortisol which cause higher hunger cues. Some with insulin resistence found fasting to be helpful. So make sure you do what works for you and always consult your doctor. \n* Supplements:\n   * Vitamin D paired with Vitamin K1 & K2\n   * Magnesium Biglycinate (I take this before bed)\n   * Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n   * Turmeric\n   * Coenzyme 10 (Take with Clomid & Vitamin E)\n   * N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)\n   * Inositol\n   * Zinc (Important to Note: It works inversely with testosterone - raises testosterone if your levels are low and lowers it if your levels are high)\n\nTo eat in a **caloric deficit**, calculate your TDEE and subtract 200-500 calories from that number. I like using this calculator.   \n[https://tdeecalculator.net](https://tdeecalculator.net)\n\nEg. If it's calculated to be 2000 calories, you subtract 200, so 1800 should be your daily calorie intake. For the activity levels make sure you do not oversell yourself. Here is a general guide:\n\n* Sedentary: Office job sat all day or less than 3000 steps per day\n* Lightly Active: Exercise 1-3 times per week or 3-10k steps daily (up to 3-4 miles daily)\n* Moderately Active: Exercise 3-5 times per week or 10-15k steps daily (up to 4-7 miles daily)\n* Highly Active: Hard exercise 6-7 training days per week or 15-20k steps daily (up to 7-10 miles daily)\n* Extremely Active: Intense daily exercise/hard physical labour 7 days a week or 25k+ steps daily (up to 10 miles daily)\n\nAs you lose weight your body adapts so after a while you may need to recalculate your TDEE and deficit. Once you are at your ideal weight, you no longer subtract the 200-500, you simply eat the TDEE amount to maintain but you do this gradually. After I lost the weight I came out of the deficit by adding 50 calories to my daily intake per week, till I was at maintenance/my TDEE. This prevented me from gaining fat or water weight.\n\nLastly, muscle mass (increase in muscle raises your metabolic level, meaning you burn more calories at rest). This is ideal and is also how you'll see someone who is short, seemingly small but weigh more than you imagined. Muscle density weighs more than fat. Think of a 50 pound dumbbell versus 50 pounds of feathers, you would need a whole lot of feathers to match the weight. Same difference, you need a larger volume of fat to equal to the same amount of muscle. Therefore, lifting weights is ideal because you will become more toned, burn more calories at rest, be able to eat more even when you've lost the weight to maintain your phisique, you'll be more insulin sensitive, and you will have stronger and higher bone density (really important for women, we lose up to 5% of muscle mass per decade after the age of 30).\n\n# Body Recompositon: Weightlifting for health (and aesthetics), lose fat & gain muscle\n\nIt is possible to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time. I followed Huskular Goddess and and LexiiGettingFit for inspiration and they were really the ones that opened my eyes to the concept of body recomposition (gain musle while losing fat). \n\nThe benefits of this is as you're getting smaller your TDEE is increasing. This means by the time you lose the weight you'll still be eating an adequate amount. The other benefits include insulin sensitivity versus insulin resistence, higher metabolism, and a improved body composition like I mentioned before in the dummbell versus feather example. The downside is the number on the scale won't have a dramatic shift while your clothes will be fitting looser. Again, weight density plays tricks on us and it's easy to get caught up in body dismorphia but I promise it works. \n\nIn order to sustain and build muscle while losing fat, you need to be consuming enough protein while remaining in a caloric deficit. So 60-80g of protein per day minimum to lose 1-2lbs per week. Ideally it should be 0.8-1g of per pound of lean body mass. Eg, someone is 300lbs and they want to get down to 150lbs. They would eat 120-150g of protein per day. If this is too much, try to get at least 60-80g like I mentioned before. Remember even though 1-2lbs per week sounds small, the changes are significant because of the muscle gained. You will look and feel smaller.  \n\n**Weightlifting for a rounder booty** (I reshaped my glutes by weightlifting. Hormones can actually affect the shape and my PCOS did a number on me. I developed a V shape over the years. Round, square, heart, A shapes are all based on your bone structure and fat placement. Some of us just have those stubborn fat deposits in certain areas that are genetic, even when we lose the weight, it's a smaller version but the same shape. V shape on the other hand is largely seen in older women post menopause and in younger women with hormonal disorders. This is becuase the hormonal imbalances also causes muscle imbalances. Regulating your hormones helps but it won't grow the muscles for you, so I used Fit With Emely's glute guide based on your glute shape (completely free, I watched all her videos to get this info and it took me two years to go from a V shape to a round shape.\n\nHere is the guideline for each shape:\n\n**Glute Maximus** - Everyone should be working on glute maximus. It builds the shelf and overall size. Step ups (all variations), hip thrusts (all variations), lunges, rdl, leg press, all squat variations  \n**Glute Minimus** - (V and Square shapes), this muscle fills in the middle between the top and lower glute. Hip abduction, single leg bridge, Standing hip abduction/cable raises  \n**Gute Medius** - (Heart, Round, and A-shaped) this muscles builds a longer hip for top portion of the glutes. Eg. Single leg squat, Single leg deadlift, Cable clamshells, Reverse lung, step ups  \n**Underbutt** - Everyone should be working on underbutt but this is especially useful for V shaped folks. It works the hamstrings and lower portion of glutes. Good mornings, single leg rdl (also works minimus), single leg hip thrust (also works maximus), hip abductors (also works minimus)\n\nHow to structure workout:\n\n* Warm up/Dynamic Stretches (specific to the muscle group you're working eg. lower body warm up or upper body warm up, etc.)\n* Compound exercises (2-3 exercises eg. single leg rdl, good mornings, leg press - for each exercise you do 3-4 sets, 8-12 reps, with 3-4 minute rest between sets). That probably sounds like a foreign language to some, so for instance:\n   * **Start excercise 1**\n   * Set 1 (repeat exercise 1 - rdl 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 2 (repeat exercise 1 - rdl 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 3 (repeat exercise 1 - rdl 8 times)\n   * **Move on to exercise 2**\n   * Set 1 (repeat exercise 2 - leg press 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 2 (repeat exercise 2 - leg press 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 3 (repeat exercise 2 - leg press 8 times)\n   * **Move on to exercise 3**\n   * Set 1 (repeat exercise 3 - good mornings 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 2 (repeat exercise 3 - good mornings 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 3 (repeat exercise 3 - good mornings 8 times)\n* Secondary Workouts (2-3 exercises eg. step ups, bulgarian split squats, lunges - for each exercise you do 3-4 sets, 8-12 reps, with 3-4 minute rest between sets)\n* Isolated/Accessory Movements: these exercises work one part of the muscle more than others, for example an overbias on the underbutt/hamstring like I mentioned before to help with the V shape ( eg. hip abductors, kickbacks, glute bridge, lying leg raises, etc. (1-2 exercises high repetitions, low weight 2-3 sets, 15-20 reps, 1-2 minute rest between sets)\n* Static stretch/cool down (specific to the muscle group you're working eg. lower body cool down or upper body cool down, etc.)\n\nKeep in mind that you only need to work on a muscle group 2-3 times a week. So I only do glutes Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Also keep in mind while I work the lower body I am also working my upper body (eg. while doing rdls I am lifting the weight with my upper body), which is why I don't have tailered upper body days, this is for aesthetic reasons, and because weightlifting more than 3 days per week is not feasible with my PCOS. \n\nMy full routine is:\n\n* Monday- lower body\n* Tuesday - Pilates/core\n* Wednesday - Rest (I still go for walks on these days)\n* Thursday - lower body\n* Friday - Pilates/core\n* Saturday - lower body\n* Sunday - Rest (I still go for walks on these days)\n\nI also used primarily resistance bands in the beginning because gym equipment intimidated me (not anymore :) ). I started with 25lb resistance and went up to 125lbs. I use the product BandBar which allowed me to use the resistance bands like a barbell at home. This isn’t the only option and you can definitely buy resistance bands and do it without the bar. [BandBar](https://shopbandbar.com)\n\nFor the ab separation from being obese, I did this workout 3 times a week (also helpful post pregnancy): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smiGsW-mQX0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smiGsW-mQX0)\n\nFor my chest to help with getting perkier boobs (the derma rolling was what made the biggest difference, but this exercise helped as well though it took 6+ months for the changes to be significant. Women tend to take longer to grow chest muscles): [https://youtu.be/hg7\\_R29jGIE?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/hg7_R29jGIE?feature=shared)\n\nI also did workouts to help with my posture and mobility 3 times a week (any I could find online)\n\nThe last thing I will say is be mindful that you may gain weight initially when you start lifting weights. This is due to slight inflammation/water gain from foreign tension, which will last about a month or two before you adapt BUT your body will adapt, I promise. Keep in mind if it's days before your period or if you are on your period. It's not if, but when, our weight fluctuates. As long as you are in a deficit and doing everything right, the number will go down. Do not get discouraged!!!\n\n***Here is the edit to this post which includes my supplements, how I managed my inflammation, and how I improved my gut health. I also edited the information I shared prior to include a few more tips and lifestyle changes I made, and included a few more details. I also rearranged things so there is a separation between style/hair/skin and health information. The post is getting really long so I may create a separate post for personal development/mindset tips.*** \n\n# Inflammation\n\nIn my case my inflammation was caused by my PCOS, insulin resistence and my obesity, but it can be caused by chronic stress, other autoimmune disorders like IBS, Crohn's disease, etc, smoking/alcohol, age related diseases, environmental toxins, diets high in processed foods, sugars, trans fats & high omega-6 fatty acids. \n\nIn my case the inflammation from the PCOS led to gut inflammation due to the high levels of coritsal (stress hormones) in reaction to the high testosterone and insulin resistence. I also experienced metabolic inflammation (non alcoholic fatty liver disease), skin inflammation (as I mentioned earlier the ezcema on my scalp, alopecia, and hirsutism), adipose tissue inflammation, chronic low grade inflammation (this led to edema or fuid retention -> insulin resistance and my high testosteron/androgen levels also exacerbated this).\n\nTo fix this these were the thin I added to my life:\n\n* Dry brushing 2-3 times a week\n* Body Gua sha\n* Face Gua Sha or Face Yoga or Myofascial Massage \n* Jump Rope\n* Trampoline/Rebounder\n* Vibration Plate (very useful for after a workout or while sitting down)\n* Acupressure mat\n* Arvigo (Mayan Abdominal massage) & Lymphatic drainage massage\n* Leg elevation, I sleep with a pillow under my knees. In the evenings I keep my legs up.\n* Massages\n* Sweat more (exercise/sauna/steam room)\n* Portable Infrared Sauna (reduce cortisol by 25%)\n* Microcurrent\n* Compression socks\n* Castor oil pack 3-4x per week\n* Eliminate inflammatory triggers (mine were gluten & dairy)\n   * Switch to sourdough\n   * Eliminate seed oils\n   * Avoid alcohol & smoking\n* Supplements\n   * Vitamin D paired with Vitamin K1 & K2\n   * Magnesium Biglycinate (I take this before bed)\n   * Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n   * Turmeric\n   * Coenzyme 10 (Take with Clomid & Vitamin E)\n   * N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)\n* Teas that helped\n   * Turmeric\n   * Red Rasberru Leaf Tea\n   * Fennel\n   * Chamomile\n\n# Gut Health \n\nYour microbiota needs the right bacteria in the right amount to perform its hormone regulating functions properly. When the type or number of bacteria gets disturbed by events such as stress, or poor diet, or your gut can no longer accomplish its job meaning you'll have inflammation, increased risk of chronic disease, skin conditions, mental health issues, weakened immune system, nutrient absorprion problems, and weight management challenges.   \n\n\nFor weight loss issues, gut microbiomes influence hormones in producing and signaling leptin and ghrelin (these hormones regulate hunger and fullness signals). Inflammation and insulin resistence is also associated with gut health problems as mentioned before. Energy extraction from foods, certain gut bacteria are more efficient at extracting energy from food, particularly carbohydrates. When there is an imbalance, more calories can be absorbed from food leading to difficulties gaining or losing weight. \n\nThings I did to improve gut health/intestinal permeability:\n\n* Ate foods rich in digestive enzymes (mangoes, pineapple, etc.)\n* Pre and probiotics (incorporate bifidobacterium and lactobacillus)\n   * Favorite brand: Seed Heath Probiotics\n* Pickles (without vinegar): Great source of prebiotics\n* Apple Cider Vinegar/Kimchi/Kombucha/Sauerkraut\n   * Beware of certain types of vinegar contain chemicals which kill bacteria, “the good bacteria”, and leave the yeast Candida albicans alone.\n   * Raw apple cider vinegar contains: Natural probiotics (friendly bacteria), which may help with your immune system and gut health.\n      * Tablespoon of apple cider vinegar (diluted in a glass of water) before each meal\n   * Balsamic vinegar: Acetic acid is the active compound in balsamic vinegar. This acid contains strains of probiotics that aid digestion. The probiotics found in acetic acid can help promote good gut health and digestion while supporting overall immune function.\n* Raw Carrots (has the type of fiber that binds and flushes out toxins in gut, good to have as daily hormone & digestion support)\n* Limit Processed foods and Sugar\n* No drinking or smoking \n* Stress managment (which I'll expand on just below)\n* Increase fiber intake\n* Regularly exercise\n* Supplements\n   * Ginger \n   * L-Glutamine\n   * Olive leaf extract (especially helpful if you have candida overgrowth)\n   * Turmereric \n* Teas\n   * Ginger\n   * Lemon Balm\n\n# Lower androgens/testosterone\n\n* Teas \n   * Nettle Tea\n   * Spearmint tea\n* Spearmint oil topically for hirsutism\n* Supplements\n   * Schisandra (adaptogen - stress management & hormone balance)\n   * Saffron (Also helps reduce testosterone, lower blood pressure and prevents bad cholesterol)\n   * Inositol\n   * Holy Basil\n   * Magnesium Biglycinate (I take this before bed)\n   * Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n   * Coenzyme 10 (Take with Clomid & Vitamin E)\n   * Zinc (Important to Note: It works inversely with testosterone - raises testosterone if your levels are low and lowers it if your levels are high)\n\n# Nervous System Regulation/ Stress Management \n\nStress is one of the things that age us the most, and people with PCOS already have higher levels of cortisol so these are the things I do to manage my stress levels:\n\n* Regulate circadian rhythm, direct sunlight upon waking up. I use a sunrise alarm clock lamp for this\n* Same bedtime everynight (pre midnight)\n* Invert screen colors at bedtime (red filter on screens)\n* Pillow under knees\n* No loud alarms\n* Magnesium biglycinate supplement before bed\n* Regulate circadian rhythm, view the sunset before bed. I use a sunrise alarm clock lamp for this\n* Spend a few minutes breathing through left nostril only\n* Epsom salt foot soak\n* Journal\n* Get back to using my coloring books (I even invested in alcohol based markers it's so fun). Regulates me and gets me in touch with my inner child\n* Time with friends, my puppy, and my family\n* Supplements\n   * Holy Basil (adaptogen - stress management & hormonal balance)\n   * L-Theanine\n   * Magnesium biglycinate \n* Teas\n   * Red raspberry leaf (adaptogen - stress management, also good for menstrual cramps)\n   * Reishi Mushroom\n   * Lemon Balm\n* Night time mocktail (have after dinner and not on an empty stomach due to the sugar levels in the tart cherry)\n   * Teaspoon of tart cherry (high levels of melatonin)\n   * Magnesium biglycinate powder\n   * Probiotic soda (good for gut health)\n\n# Tea cycling\n\n- On your period\n    - Nettle leaf: Increase iron levels\n    - Moringa: Increase iron levels\n    - Red Raspberry leaf: Helps with period cramps (best to drink throughout the month, especially at the end of the luteal phase\n    - Chamomile: Helps with wellness wind down routine when you're feeling extra tired\n- Follicular phase\n    - Focus teas: Peppermint, Spearmint\n    - Adaptogens: Lion's mane, Adaptogen latte, and Chaga mushroom\n    - Detox: Dandelion Root\n- Ovulation phase\n    - Detox: Dandelion root tea\n    - Bloating: turmeric tea latte/golden latte\n    - Estrogen dominance - symptoms (bad hormonal migraines, hot flashes, nausea): Schisandra berry, Lemon balm\n- Luteal phase\n    - PMS symptoms: Raspberry leaf, Schisandra berry, Ginger root (powder or tea)\n\n\nThe best teas for PCOS\n\n- Spearmint\n    - For reducing androgens & lowering hirsutism (facial hair)\n- Cinnamon tea (improves insulin sensitivity)\n- Chamomile tea (Adaptogen)\n- Nettle Tea (reduce androgens)\n- Red raspberry leaf (adaptogen/stress relief, also good for menstrual cramps)\n- Schisandra (adaptogen/stress relief & hormone balance)\n- Saffron (Also helps reduce testosterone, lower blood pressure and prevents bad cholesterol)\n- Ginger (ginger offers anti-inflammatory, fertility and hormone-balancing benefits, aides digestion )\n\n\n# Seed Cycling\n\nWhat is seed cycling? Seed cycling refers to the consumption of specific seeds at different times of the month in order to improve the production and levels of sex hormones, specifically estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone.\n\nSeed cycling divides the female menstrual cycle into two parts:\n\n1. During the first half of the menstrual cycle, or days 1 through 14, seed cycling encourages daily consumption of **flax and pumpkin seeds.**\n2. During the second half of the menstrual cycle, or days 15 through 28, seed cycling encourages daily consumption of **sunflower and sesame seeds**\n\n*Results from seed cycling will not happen overnight. Normally women observe improvements after approximately three months of seed cycling adherence. It took me about 4ish months.*\n\n**The Benefits of Seed Cycling:** Support hormonal balance, alleviate PMS symptoms, decrease hormonal acne, alter irregularity of menstrual cycles, and fight stomach bloating and fatigue.\n\n",

(June 2022)\n\nHair care routine: I wash my hair every single day with a shampoo with sulphates (right now I’m loving the Loreal Extraordinary Oil shampoo, it makes my hair feel full and light and it smells amazing!)\n\nSometimes I’ll do a pre-shampoo treatment with the Garnier Hair Filler Rinse Out Treatment, maybe twice a week?\n\nFor conditioner and leave-in conditioner I like something that contains silicones and glycerin within the first few ingredients. For conditioner, my ride-and-dies are the Garnier Moisture Repair conditioner (smells incredible too), and the Dove Intenser Repair conditioner. Right now I’m using the Tressemme Lamellar Gloss Cream as leave in, but if you prefer a higher end conditioner, the Redken All Soft never EVER failed me!\n\nThen I just let it air dry and put it up in a loose bun of top of my head to sleep in :p",

    "body": "I had a breakout from using an after sun gel. My skin was so sensitive it burned as I applied it. I have eczema and never had it on my face until now. The problems were dry patches, discoloration, pimples and tiny pustules of dead skin cells. So, I started researching ingredients that could work for me. While doing that I found out I had a broken skin barrier. My skin was reacting negatively to anything I put on it. And using the antibacterial soap totally dried out my skin. I started with the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Cream-to-Foam cleanser for sensitive skin. At first I wanted the La-roche Posay Lipikar gentle face wash but that was out of my price range and I didn’t want to wait for the order to come in the mail. I found the Neutrogena one at Walmart. The main thing that attracted me to the wash was its inclusion of CICA (Cantella Asiatica) aka BarrierTechnology™ which is an extract that helps soothe the skin and moisturize. Next, I got vegetable-based glycerin in the first aid department at Walmart. I mixed one drop in with my regular moisturizer to leave my skin feeling soft. Glycerin also penetrates deep into the skin because the molecular size/shape is similar to water molecules. Next, is using a 2% salicylic acid cream I got from dollar tree (yes it actually works) 2-3 times a day on the affected areas. I did this for 4-5 days and saw amazing results. This got rid of the bumps and deep-seated painful acne that stayed under the skin. Lastly, I got the La Roche Possy Triple Repair Face & Body Moisturizer. This leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated. So after all of that. Now I just use the Neutrogena cream to foam cleanser in the morning and at night then follow up with the La roche posay. I spot treat any white heads I see with the salicylic acid. I also started using the Black Girl Sunscreen kids version and it’s the only sunscreen that doesn’t hurt or cause reactions. \n\nThese photos were taken 9 days apart. \n\nTLDR: \nI had a breakout from over stripping my skin, had a reaction to an after-sun gel, and sunscreen. \n\nProducts used: \n-La Roche Posay Triple Repair Face & Body moisturizer. \n-Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Cream-To-Foam Cleanser \n-Dollar Tree 2% Salicylic Acid Acne Spot Treatment \n-Vaseline \n-Vitamin E Oil \n\nRoutine Now: \nNeutrogena Cleanser 2x a day\nLa Roche Posay moisturizer 2x a day\nVaseline 2-3x a week at night \nBlack Girl Sunscreen as needed\nSalicylic Acid Acne Spot treatment as needed",

        "body": "Your skin looks fabulous!! Congratulations! I have always found that consistently washing and moisturizing my face makes such a difference. Sometimes I get caught up in whether I'm using the right products or doing the right routine, but really 90% of the improvement is achieved just by washing and moisturizing every day. I've tried finding 'better' products or more complicated routines, but for me it's diminishing returns. \n\nI am very much not an expert, but as someone else who struggles with skin/hair picking, here is something that really helped me. If I don't do skincare, my skin gets like yours in the first picture. I call it congested, where it's flaky and sort of dull-ish. However, when my skin is flaky, it's fine to remove the flakes, it isn't like a scab and the skin underneath isn't raw or anything. If this isn't your situation, ignore this.\n\nI massage/exfoliate my skin with unscented mineral oil, and it gets all the flakes/dead skin off my face. It also gives me a way to 'smooth' things out without picking at anything. I let the oil sit for a few minutes before massaging everything. Little grits come out of my pores, but also the dead skin from any flaky areas comes off. Sometimes I'll try to massage it along with one of those lymphatic massage videos, but I rarely do that, it's nice but most times I can't be bothered. It's a physical process and it gets off/softens all the spots I would pick at, but also the slippery nature of the mineral oil makes it really hard to get in there with my nails and do any damage. \n\nI definitely do it when I've skipped a couple days, because that's when things get flaky/not as soft and I have the urge to pick at everything. Aside from that, maybe once a week if I feel like it. Mineral oil gets a bad rap, but it's actually a very safe/skin friendly ingredient. Just make sure you wash it off afterwards. Depending on how gentle your face wash is, you may need to wash it twice. \n\nOf course, right now your skin looks so glowing and smooth, I wouldn't change a thing. But if the compulsion to pick gets bad/things get more flaky, this might help.",

I typically average about 30-40 miles per week depending on where I am in the training block. I go through a pair every 3-4 months give or take.

    "body": "**Hello reddit!**\n\nAs some of us may already know, today is the day that the FDA regulations go into effect in the states. I, for one, don’t want these regulations to be the end of the vaping industry, or any of our local vape stores that we know and love. So, I decided to do something about it. \n\nMy name is Erik Chapman. My business partner and best friend is Patrick Dougherty. We're both 20.\n [We founded our company, Cloud N LLC,](http://i.imgur.com/adEf4qU.jpg) from our college dorm room, and later in [my basement](http://i.imgur.com/OVFA7pZ.jpg) with our friends, in response to the FDA regulations. We started with getting a provisional patent on our idea. Now, we’ve also already made inroads with the nascent medical cannabis industry in our home state, Maryland. We’re members of several legal affinity groups and the MDCIA (Maryland Cannabis Industry Association).\n\n[To read further about the FDA regulations, please follow this link.](http://vaping360.com/fda-ban-on-vaping-the-ugly-truth/)\n\nPatrick and I have designed, are currently testing, and intend to bring to market [the *Nebula*,](http://i.imgur.com/Ob1ft6Y.jpg) a device that uses novel, heatless technology to nebulize (not vaporize) e-liquids in an FDA compliant way.\n\n[That’s right - it’s a “vaporizer” that’s completely heatless.](http://i.imgur.com/XAu9NO6.jpg) No wicks, no coils, no ceramic plates: nothing. According to several compliance attorneys we've talked to, this means it’s not subject to the FDA regulatory packet, which defines an *ENDS* as a device that (among other things) uses heat as the operative method to aerosolize solutions of nicotine.\n\nOn top of this revolution, the *Nebula* brings two long overdue innovations to the nicotine vape market (and eventually to the cannabis and medical markets):\n\n* Heatless, healthy nebulization into mist\n* and precise dosage control\n\nLet's break down and explain each innovation that the *Nebula* brings to the table.\n\n**Heatless nebulization:**\n\nWhile the vast majority of current vaporizers use a combination of wicks, coils, and heat to convert juice into vapor, the Nebula accomplishes this using a [patented, solid state, electromechanical pore transducer to emit a cloud of 1-2 micron sized droplets of water containing the users desired agent](http://i.imgur.com/hzydRHW.gifv) (sorry for the poor quality gif) that contains a salt stereoisomer of nicotine (similar to [PAX’s JUUL](https://www.juulvapor.com/)). Along with bypassing the FDA regulations, this means:\n\n* No burnt hits EVER AGAIN\n* No wicks, no coils, no maintenance, no money going down the drain\n* Heatless, water based aerosolization allows for a cleaner taste profile - the first draw tastes like the thousandth draw: crisp, clean, and fully flavorful. \n* Even healthier than existing vapes - unlike previously, the resulting aerosol is literally just water mist nearly identical (phase-wise) to clouds and fog.\n\nAlso, due to our patented dual tank design, vape stores would be able to mix any e-juices they desire for our device, using the same equipment they already have, without violating FDA regulations regarding flavor. For anyone who’s interested in the specifics of this process and its compliance with regulations, please contact the email below.\n\n**Dosage control:**\n\nThe Nebula gives you more personalization and control over your device than anything else on the market; in addition to allowing vapers and B&M owners to continue their respective ways of life and business models, it gives the user direct control over the exact dosage of nicotine that he/she wants - down to a tenth of a milligram. If you’re trying to quit smoking (despite the FDA’s best attempts), this means you no longer have to make the leaps between different juice concentrations. Dosage control allows you to scale down the nicotine as fast or as slow as you’d like, a tenth of a milligram per session at a time.\n\nThe Nebula accomplishes this revolutionary feat of dosage control with a microchip computer that queries the user the following in order to create a personalized dosage profile:\n\n* Nicotine level of juice in the device (in mg/ml),\n* Desired dose in milligrams (mg) For reference, the average amount of nicotine in a single cigarette is 1.7mg.\n* Amount of time to complete the session, elected by the user (in minutes:seconds)\n\nWe’re working with our investors to start high-volume manufacturing and marketing, but seeing as the regulations for juice came into effect today, we need as much publicity as we can handle so that we can speed this process up and get our products into the hands of you and your local vape store owners. We CANNOT let vaping die - for the sake of every ex-smoker the FDA doesn’t care about. For all the smokers who want to quit but feel like they can’t. I’m trying to quit smoking myself, and Patrick’s dad has COPD from smoking for so long and is trying to quit. This is a personal battle for us.\n\nPlease, tell your vaping friends and local store owners about our product; we’re sending out promotional packages with educational brochures and demo/beta models ASAP, we’re starting low-volume manufacturing soon and will be transitioning to high-volume manufacturing not much later when we have the space and capital to do so.\n\nWe’re making this product for the market, so we appreciate any and all feedback from you - you can give us that by filling out this [short survey.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScelxEiV2kBzxjgDu8q2UF3jUFkwKTtiMXnuWxjOiUpFcnmGw/viewform) We really appreciate your contribution to our research.\n\nAlso, we're looking for interested stores to whom we can send promotional kits and units, so if you would like to see our beta model in your local store, please enter your or your store's contact information into [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScuVBJT4yobU2FgxVkIVP3loYb8IyUDL-qMcufTKLLyUxIRrg/viewform).\n\nYou can also follow us on social media for updates while we set up our website:\n\nfacebook.com/cloudnllc\n\ninstagram.com/cloudnllc (@cloudnllc)\n\ntwitter.com/cloudnllc (@cloudnllc)\n\nLastly, if you’d like to get in direct contact with us, please shoot us an email at cloudnebula.contact@gmail.com\n\nThanks for your time, and vape on.\n\n(link to full photo album with extras: http://imgur.com/a/VueY5)\n\nDisclaimer: All information disclosed in this post regarding possible agents (such as nicotine) that may be used in our device are purely illustrative and doesn't reflect the opinion of Cloud N LLC or disclose any intended or recommended uses for Cloud N devices.\n______________________________________________________________\n\nEDIT for clarity:\n\n/u/wbgraphic brought up a good point about compliance and FDA purview. I'll clarify this in the OP here:\n\n>Our compliance attorney (I just emailed her with your question) has been working with us to shape our business model and our products to comply with existing regulations.\n\n>The relevant literature pertaining to our device is in the section of the packet deeming regulations on all ENDSs. Our device doesn't fall under the purview of those regulations for the simple fact that the design of the Nebula doesn't conform to the FDA's description of an ENDS, nor does it have a remotely similar use profile. I can't give away too much information on the computer control/nebulization method because it's proprietary, although I encourage you to contact your store about getting a promo kit.\n\n>As for juices, my attorney advises me that because our device doesn't fall under the purview of an ENDS that needs tobacco specific approval, a juice designed specifically for that ENDS (which contains a different but still stereoisomeric form of nicotine) which will not work with existing ENDSs, is also outside of that purview.\n\n>Lastly, my attorney advises me to state that because our device doesn't explicitly deliver drugs (rather than agents) for therapeutic purposes, it isn't necessary to go through the FDA approval process until we breach into the medical cannabis market.\n\n>We're working with researchers around the state to prove a link between aerosol therapies of cannabis and cancer in order to get a grant for (and also speed up) our eventual FDA application.\n\n>...\n\n>I'm sorry this wasn't clearer before. The title of our provisional patent reads as follows: Precise portable aerosol agent delivery device\n\n>This is intentional. The device works with anything the user can dissolve in glycerin (organics) or water (alkaline/freebases), and can still output precise doses of the user's desired agent. Although the post here focuses on nicotine, (being a vape based sub) official sales and marketing materials carefully avoid explicit mentions of possible uses.\n\nAlthough I'm likely mincing her words, we're deferring to our attorney about regulatory compliance, and that information will be included in any promotional kit we send out.\n\nEDIT 2, more clarity:\n\n>Our device, in general, is a handheld nebulizer with dosage control. It's not designed for explicit, sole use with nicotine solutions or otherwise, and our PPA reflects this.\n\n>The device has two tanks to do dosage control - one is a vehicle solution tank, and the other contains the active agent (in this case, nicotine).\n\n>In the first tank, you can put in a dilution of nicotine salt in water without flavoring. In the other, you can put in a solution of flavor and water with no nicotine (this is literally juice - like apple juice).\n\n>When the computer combines the two at a certain rate (based on the user's desire taste/dose profile) the result is a flavored nicotine aerosol.\n\n>As far as I know, flavorless nicotine salt in water is a-ok to sell, and so is flavored water (Mio, anyone?)\n\nEDIT 3, grammar\n\nEDIT 4:\n\nAfter all of your feedback, we've created a new design!\n\nTake a look [HERE] (https://goo.gl/forms/5OGsCl13PpRm0d9L2)\n",

    "body": "Hello all! Before we begin, I would like to apologize for the length of this post. I must say that writing this was rather… cathartic for me, I suppose, and I guess I just sort of wrote my thoughts as they came. That being said, I’ll be highlighting certain sections that I believe to be salient in successful weight loss and dieting. And at the bottom of my story, I’ll go into more specifics Thanks for being a great community, and for taking the time to read this post.\n\nI suppose that the best place to begin would be the beginning: it all started a little over 18 years ago, in a small hospital in downtown Jacksonville……. But in reality, my “weight loss journey” began just over a year ago, on May 19th, 2014. That day, I woke up late in the morning with nothing to do. Classes had ended. I had no assignments to complete, papers to fluff, or tests to pretend to study for. Instead, I rolled out of bed, creaked along the floor to my desk, sat down at my computer, and began my reddit ritual: checking the first 100 posts on the frontpage and then seeing if anything else exciting was going on in the smaller subreddits. Somewhere in my glossy eyed scrolling, probably in some thread in /r/AskReddit,  someone posted a link to this subreddit right here. \n\nNow, I knew I was a [large guy](http://i.imgur.com/05CEXjR.png). More than that, I knew I was [fat](http://i.imgur.com/qDTAQI6.jpg). More than that, I knew that I was [clinically obese.](http://i.imgur.com/QuUtmPy.png) It’s not really something you can avoid noticing, or at least, it’s not something I could avoid noticing. I’ve never been good at lying to myself. I’d been cultivating mass, as Mac would say, since 3rd grade or so, growing “big and strong” on Totino’s Party Pizzas and McDonald’s french fries. Like everyday. But middle school is middle school, and if I hadn’t taken note of my abnormally high weight, the awkwardness that middle school instills upon people definitely would have.. So yes, I was constantly and painfully aware of my situation. In all honesty, I was probably more aware of it than anyone else in the world. My friends never actually treated me differently than they would others, I was thankfully never really bullied as a kid, and my family didn’t even really notice my unhealthy size. It was an ubiquitous fact of life: I was a paunchy, round person. It just so happened to be who I was. Nobody would say “Austin, my fat friend,” but they would say “you know Austin, right? Bigger dude, nice guy though.” And that description would usually suffice to jog people's’ memory. Being fat wasn’t some unfortunate affliction that I happened to be cursed with; it was a part of my personality, a descriptor that would identify me in a crowd, a remarkable trait that others took notice of, and something that I had just sort of come to accept as being myself for the rest of my life. And it wasn’t something I was particularly upset about. I was very much apathetic about the entire ordeal.\n\nStill, being the size I was, going in for regular checkups and just living around other people, I knew it was a problem. The doctors I went to in my life would always talk to my parents about fixing my diet, about trying to get my down to a healthy weight. It makes sense I suppose, because through all of middle school and a lot of high school, kids are dependent upon their parents for meals, but I still think it was a mistake for them to never come to me about it. **Ultimately, a person is in control of their own health and lifestyle**, even at the age I was at. I digress though, as the point is that I knew my obesity was an issue, a serious one at that. I knew roughly what I needed to do to fix the issue, not with any depth, but if you live in modern day America you’re constantly bombarded by healthy living advice, some good and most bad. And my parents had tried putting me on a diet before, but I simply wasn’t interested. I loved food, a lot. Still do, in fact. I wasn’t intrinsically motivated to do better for myself in life. The short term reward of eating an entire sleeve of Oreos completely outweighed the idea of shedding a few pounds.\n\nHowever, I did end up here, in /r/loseit one faithful morning. I guess you can say this is where my inspiration comes from. I still don’t really know why, but I was reading through the posts on this subreddit, seeing people transform into entirely different looking people, and decided to start. I vividly remember thinking to myself “well, I guess now is the time to give it a go.” The day before was a Sunday. I know that because I sat down in the morning with four waffles covered in a mixture of chocolate and maple syrup, topped with whipped cream and a cherry, and devoured the plate while watching something on Netflix, as I did every Sunday morning. The day after, on Monday, I spent the day on Reddit. The day after that, on Tuesday, I still spent the day on reddit, but I had MyFitnessPal app downloaded on my phone and was limiting myself to 1800 calories a day. So I don’t exactly know what made me make a change. It was partially out of boredom; the summer slump was on, and I needed something to change up the humdrum of normal life. It was partially out of being inspired by [posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1wy825/one_year_later_and_fat_girl_is_gone_progress_pics/) [like](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/16bq23/progress_pics_423_lbs_to_245_lbs_the_eulogy_for/) [these](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/21yxup/my_3_year_transformation_from_clinically_obese/#img9). Especially that last one, because I saw a person that started at a very similar weight to me and end up as he did. Shoutout to that dude, he has dedication. Ultimately though, I think that my cause for starting, and cause for continuing was just because I wasn’t happy with who I was. On the surface, I didn’t care much about being the fat guy. I was fine with it, because I liked my personality and I respected myself, both of which let me ignore the issue before me. But subconsciously, I think it was one of the only things I was unhappy with in life. I believe that it was a lifetime of buildup that led me to change my lifestyle for the better, and this subreddit served as a catalyst in setting me off.\n\nAnd I really set off. One of the things that I’m most proud about in my life is that **I won’t half ass something. If something is worth me doing it, I might as well actually do it.** So, like I said, I started out with MyFitnessPal and was extremely strict on myself during that time. 1800 calories a day. Weight check at the end of the week. Lost 2.4 pounds. Readjust calories. 1760 calories a day. Weight check at the end of the week. Lost 2.1 pounds. Readjust calories, 1740 calories a day. And so on and so forth, until eventually it had been 4 months and I had lost A little under 40 pounds. I was very happy with my results, despite not looking drastically different from before. The numbers that came off the scale became my motivation, along with the loosening of my shirts and pants. It is at this point that people began to take notice of my weight loss. At this point I was eating 1200 calories a day, the absolute minimum that MyFitnessPal would allow me to eat, as anything under would be considered dangerous. I lived the 1200 calorie life for two months, roughly, and I gotta say, it’s not bad. I don’t really remember being hungry at any given time, and at that point, **I saw food more as fuel than as something to be enjoyed.**\n\nI had started to visit weight loss and nutrition sites and subreddits more often. As a tangent, I believe simplesciencefitness.com to be one of the best sites out there for people that want to begin, but know nothing about nutrition or how any of this “fitness” stuff works. Anyways, at the beginning of September, I discovered /r/keto and the ketogenic diet. I begun reading up on it. “Oh, isn’t this that Atkins diet thing that was super popular with people in the 80s or something?” Yes, yes it is. but after reading through this document, compiled by the lovely folk on /r/keto, I decided to give keto a try. The thing about eating on 1200 calories a day is that you learn to eat lower calorie foods to properly fill your stomach. I hadn’t eaten anything sugary or desertlike for quite a while at that point, and I figured if I only had to cut bread and starches out of my diet, easy enough. \n\nSo I started on a ketogenic diet at the end of September, and man, you lose weight fast on keto. The first few weeks saw me lose close to 8 pounds, at a speed matched only by the initial massive rush of weight loss. After the first month it slowed down a bit, but I would still lose upwards of 2 pounds a week. One thing that I had been doing the entire time I was dieting was keeping quiet about it. I have a hard time admitting to people that I have my own weaknesses, because a lot of time I attempt to serve as a solid, stable rock to others. Because of that, I chose to tell no one of my diet changes and choices in the first few months. When people would bring up “oh hey, you look different? Did you get a haircut? You look slimmer,” or when my mother would query “Austin, are you on a diet? You’re eating differently than you used to,” I would always laugh it off with a “Me? Nah man, I haven’t been doing anything.” When you go on keto though, that option goes out the window. People definitely take notice, like when you hit up a McDonald’s with your boys and you order two cheeseburgers and eat the insides out. It’s actually how my mother first discovered my dieting, despite her suspicions previously: one night, a few days after I had started keto, she made spaghetti, one of my favorite meals in the whole wide world. It’s really hard to hide your diet when you sit yourself down with  a bowl of tomato sauce and parmesan cheese.\n\nIn any case, the ketogenic diet worked wonders for me. I was very stringent in the beginning, refusing to eat nuts or sauces of any kind, for their negligibly small carb counts. I subsisted on well seasoned meats, well seasoned veggies, and large volumes of cheese. At the beginning of January, I decided to loosen up a bit, adding in nuts and sauces and sugar free jello every once in a while to my diet. Also at this time I convinced one of my very close friends to come with me to the gym, under the guise of starting him on a New Year’s Resolution. Only two days a week, but weight and resistance training at the gym was fun and got me active. I can go into my routine at the gym, but it’s nothing special and there are honestly people in this subreddit that would be leagues better to use as a reference- I’ve even given the link to one of them. I also started drinking protein shakes and was tracking macros for a while, to supplement my exercise, but stopped because of the consistency of my diet. Honestly, on keto, I consistently reached all of my protein and fat goals for the day without trying whatsoever, It comes naturally on the diet.\n\nI went back to my doctor in March for bloodwork and a checkup, and she was nothing if not ecstatic. The first thing she said when she walked into my room was “So, did you find a magic shrinking machine sometime in the past few months, or what?” Which was honestly pretty cool, because I respect that lady a lot. I haven’t made too many changes over the past few months. I’ve been focussing on finishing strong in high school/ earning my dual enrollment degree, which is why I haven’t done anything radical or new. Because my [degree is finished](http://i.imgur.com/4Xb0W1y.png) though, I don’t have access to a gym over the summer, so I’m starting on the /r/C25K running plan over the summer. Probably gonna die in the Florida heat, but I’m looking forward to it.\n\nI suppose now is the part that I talk about how my weight loss has affected my life. A lot of people can list off really drastic changes in their life and talk about how everything is different for them, because they dropped a hundred pounds. I can’t exactly claim that, but I can say that just about everything in my life is better. To start off with, I feel tremendously better; hell, I feel tremendous in general, but this time not because of obesity. Everything feels great. Sitting down feels better. Standing feels better. Walking feels better. And now I can finally perform those tasks without difficulty breathing. And my god, breathing is excellent. Taking full breaths, releasing full breaths, not feeling like I need to gulp down more air all the time. Climbing stairs without getting just a bit winded doing it. I mean, I now feel just more suitable in general doing anything at all, because I don’t have a literal extra 100 pounds of weight holding me down. \n\nThe other part of that is that I don’t always feel like people are looking at me now. If you’ve ever been obese, or even larger than you’re comfortable with, then you know the feeling. You notice your own flaws caused by the weight, and you hone in on them because they become obvious to you, so whenever other people look at you, you feel as if they’re honing in on those same flaws, even if they’re not. I rarely feel that way nowadays. I still got some issues to work out with my stomach, but I’m pretty much totally comfortable being in public. Hanging out with friends is nicer, because I don’t feel out of place at all. I mean, I never really did before because I have an awesome group of friends, but it was always just an elephant in the room for me; something no one would acknowledge but something that I felt definitively separated me from them.\n\nClothes are really cool too. Before, the purpose of my clothing was to find something that could hide or shield away the flab and excess that I had, but now clothes are super cool. I feel like all the good clothes items are made in size medium, because there’s tons of cool shit that I never wore before that I’m wearing now. And as an aside from that, when I was losing weight, all my old clothes just got better before I had to get rid of them. Things loosening up, fitting better, and then getting too loose and fitting worse and then having to replace them… .But that first part, where they begin to feel better, more adequate, that’s really cool. And hell, realizing that you need to replace your current wardrobe because things are starting to hang off of you is a cool feeling too, and a massive confidence boost.\n\nIn the end, not much has changed. I may be about half the person I was before, but my personality is still the same: I still laugh way too much, love too strong, and bitch a bit too much. I still pride myself on being a good student, I still try to be supportive to the people I care about in my life, and I still can’t do a backflip. Not yet, anyways. But if I felt that my life was a 5 or 6 before, it’s a 7 on the worst days and and a 9 on the best now. I’m a much happier, healthier person than I was a year ago, and I’m not afraid to say that I’m proud of how far I’ve come, and excited for how far I’m going to go in the future. This isn’t so much the end of my journey as another turning point: I’ve still got plenty of work to do, in regards to fitness. But I feel that a year is a good amount of time for me to post this, and that I’d like to contribute back to this community that not only inspired me at the beginning, but continues to inspire me now. Anyways, that’s my story. [Thanks](http://i.imgur.com/VvM43Tb.png), /r/loseit.\n\n\n\nLet’s break it down now\n\nThese are a few things I’ve picked out from my story that I think were the most integral parts of me succeeding in my diet. Of course, there are others, but I feel like these ones need to be especially reinforced. These aren’t hard and fast rules, by any means, but they’re more like my opinion on my own success and what I think will translate to other people and help them succeed.\n\n1. Ultimately, a person is in control of their own health and lifestyle: I know that, for a while in my younger years, I would blame my parents for making me fat. It was, after all, their responsibility to teach me about nutrition and they provided me all my food for my youth, so it was their job to keep me healthy, right? Well, I can’t really argue with that, but at a certain point I realized that it was honestly as much my fault as it was there’s. Sure, they weren’t the healthiest folk on the planet during my childhood but I can’t wholly blame them for my obesity because past a certain age, I’d realized that I’d made the choice to eat half a pizza or a box of cosmic brownies. That was all on me. Sure, you can say that they should have taught me harsher that those probably weren’t healthy eating habits, but things become much easier to fix when you stop pointing fingers and placing blame on everyone. In regards to your health and weight loss, this manifests as you realizing that you have a problem that needs to be fixed. No point in getting mad at your parents for raising you, your co-workers for offering you cake, your friends for being able to eat all they want and not gain weight, and most certainly not yourself for letting yourself get to a bad place in life. It’s best to just recognize the existence of the problem, and then do your damndest to fix it. Once you get past the recognition step, it’s your ball: you’re the only one that’s going to be able to make the changes required to fix it, so no matter how you got to where you are, you’re the one that’s getting yourself out.\n\n1. No half-assing: This one is huge, probably the most important thing I can ever say to anyone planning on going on a diet, or performing a lifestyle change as I did. I grew up watching my mother fail at dieting again and again because she had no restraint. She would start a diet and immediately begin sneaking food, or making little cheats that “nobody will see, nobody will care about.” Cut that shit out immediately before it even starts. If you’re gonna do this, you’re gonna fucking do this. Commit to it, dammit. If you’re eating 1800 calories a day, eat 1800 calories a day. Just because “eating 1900 won’t affect it too much,” or you’re feeling like “eh, no harm no foul if I just eat this one donut,” you’re sabotaging your own hard work for a short term pleasure. I understand, dieting can be hard, and you’ll miss plowing through four waffles or a sleeve of oreos or a tray of pizza rolls. But you’ve decided to make a change for the better, don’t disappoint yourself by letting it all be for naught. Now, that may seem drastic, because in all honesty, the difference between 1800 and 1900 isn’t huge, and that one donut isn’t going to set you all the way back, but the mentality is both corrosive and pervasive. I’ve seen it firsthand, where the slightest luxury will allow someone to completely ruin their own diet. Same thing when you think “I can skip the gym tonight, I’m really tired.” Pretty soon you’ll skip the gym every night, because you’re always going to be tired. Consistency is key to diet and exercise: If you stick to a strict regimen, you’re absolutely sure to make it. That being said, a lot of people do like to allow themselves their weekly or monthly “cheat days” where they either go all out or have some small exception in their diet, and that seems to work well for a lot of people. So if that works well for you, and the results are still satisfying to you, who am I to tell you not to do it? In my experience, absolutely buckling down on my diet, allowing for no cheating or wavering in belief, worked extremely well. Even if you do allow yourself a cheat day every once in a while, don’t get wishy washy with it. For example, “oh, my cheat day yesterday wasn’t super bad, so today I’ll just let myself eat this slice of cheesecake.” This kind of thinking will absolutely corrode away your diet and all your hard work. Ultimately, the point is to set your plan and stick with it. Any changes you make should be well thought out and done without the presence of cheesecake or Oreos. And for your own sake, commit to this lifestyle and don’t half ass your own health.\n\n1. Fuel, no pleasure: This one is something that I don’t think everyone should get on board with. Food is awesome. I love food. My love for food was my primary reason for being obese, and I still retain that love of food, in a much healthier manner. However, back when I was eating 1200 calories a day, I didn’t really enjoy food the same way. I enjoyed food in the way that it didn’t take up a huge allotment of my calories during the day, that it filled me up to a point where I wasn’t super hungry by the time my next meal came around. I thought of all food as just fuel, and I still do, to an extent. I enjoy my food more nowadays, but I don’t think that seeing food as only fuel is a bad mentality for the obese. Let’s be honest here: when you’re as far as I was into being overweight, you form this sort of odd relationship with food. Food makes you happy when you have it and it’s good, and it makes you sad to not have the food you like or if you don’t get to eat something you wanted to eat. I mean, I still get enjoyment and disappointment from food now, but it’s much different than when I was obese. I think a big step of any successful weight loss is to break this odd relationship that some people form with food. Instead of having such an emotional connection with it foremost, it’s important to recognize that it’s simply fuel. And that cheesecake is not as good a fuel as a bundle of asparagus is. Speaking of which,\n\n1. Healthier choices: This one is pretty obvious, I suppose, but I still feel it needs to be said. If you want to survive on 1200 calories a day, you can’t spend 500 of them on a Reese’s peanut butter cup. Yes, it is true that, if you only eat another 700 calories during the day that you will lose weight. But honestly, weight loss is never the true goal, despite what you may think. The real goal here is fat loss, which may sound simple but there’s an important distinction between the two. This is actually one of the primary reasons I switched to the ketogenic diet. I noticed that I was losing just as much muscle mass in a week or month as I was fat. And I didn’t have much muscle to begin with, so that’s saying something. In any case, macronutrients are important. I don’t necessarily think you need to track them, unless you’re trying to get ripped, but keep in mind that you should definitely fill your diet with a reasonable amount of protein, even if you’re not on keto. \n\nSo what the hell did I actually do over the past year, and what would I recommend to others? First of all, I’d highly recommend the simple thermodynamic, calorie-in calorie-out diet. Tracking calories-in and calories-out is incredibly easy using the MyFitnessPal app. It’s also one of the most consistent and reliable weight loss methods out there. I chose the option of losing 2 pounds a week, and given that I followed the calorie limits that the app imposed on me, I would lose anywhere from 1.5 to 2.5 pounds in a week, which is really damn accurate if you ask me. The other good thing about this simple calorie based diet is that it forces you to eat healthier, if you’re smart about it. You’ll learn to add more meats to your diet, cut out the sugars and excess calories, eat more vegetables just to fill you up more, and be overall healthier because of your rationed calories. If you’re looking for consistency, accessibility, and balance in your diet, then calorie counting is the way to go, in my opinion.\n\nNow, I’ve already mentioned why I decided to switch over to keto, so allow me to extol some of it’s virtues. I fucking love bacon. I fucking love eggs. I fucking love cheese, chicken wings, and deep fried vegetables. And out of all of those things, only eggs are really acceptable if you go into a huge calorie deficit. But because of the way keto works (really, read that document if you’re interested. It does the best job of explaining it without going into any medically specific details,) there’s no worries. I eat what I want and I lose the weight that I want. at the pace I want. When I first started, I lost the same 2 to 3 pounds a week I was losing before, but I was eating more food and enjoying it more. It’s slowed down now that I’m a healthy weight, but the weight melts off. I also feel better, strangely enough, after each fat filled meal, and because my body’s not creating a lot of glycerin, there’s generally no crash periods during the day following a carb load. I have even, reliable energy throughout the day, and I feel great. The high protein intake is also pretty cool. \n\nAlthough I’m a big proponent of the ketogenic diet, let me throw out there that it is in no way perfect. The primary issue is that you have to be rather strict to successfully utilize it, which I’ve been fine with because I never let myself waver anyways. But if you plan on having cheat days, let me say that keto is not the diet for you. Say you want to have an ice cream sundae on Sunday, to reward yourself for a week of keto living. So you get your ice cream, and it’s really fucking good ice cream because after you’ve been away from ice cream for a while it tastes like heaven. Well, you’ve likely kicked yourself out of ketosis by flooding your system with carbs, meaning that suddenly your body isn’t burning fat like it has been. And it takes at least a few days to get back into ketosis, no matter your stringency. So late in the week, probably around Thursday, you’re all the way back to being in ketosis, but your body still doesn’t have much time to start burning fat before your next cheat day. It’s very easy to plateau or even gain weight if you half ass your keto commitment. \n\nThe other big issue with keto is that it in no way teaches you how to eat “healthier” in the classic, balanced diet view. As much as I like my diet as it is right now, I must admit that I think the balance of grain, fruit, vegetable, meat, and fat makes sense for a human. I like the idea of balance, and with keto you learn to just eat fats, meats, and vegetables. And not necessarily in classically healthy ways either. People on keto eat way more fat and meat than balanced diets would ever dream of, although we do generally get our veggies down right. The meat and fat thing is great for keto, but I think it’s clear that eating deep fried hamburger patties wrapped in a bacon weave and covered in garlic and salt seasoned onions is not the way a balanced diet would go about things. If you view keto as a “diet,” in which you start at one date and end at another, it’s probably not the diet for you, because it won’t adjust you to good maintenance after you hit your goals. If you’re like me and plan to live this sort of life for the foreseeable future, then yeah, keep on eating your fried zucchini and cheese medley.\n\nUltimately, I think the path that I went down is very effective. I highly recommend MyFitnessPal: it’s super convenient and does everything that you really need it to do in regards to tracking calories. Learning how to properly eat that balanced diet is probably a good thing for everyone to learn how to do, especially if you’re planning on trying out keto but don’t think you want to stick with it for a lifetime. That being said, I love the ketogenic diet and would recommend it to anyone, even if they don’t have any weight they necessarily need to lose. I think that life is generally better this way. \n\nOh, and as one final note, start your exercise plans as soon as possible people. I’m really just getting serious about it now, but man, I wish I had started earlier. I could’ve been like [this guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/31bm59/1_year_110lbs_pics_included_shirtless_dude_warning/) at this point if I had. In any case, I hope that I’ve inspired/helped literally anyone with this post. And if I haven’t, I hope someone at least enjoyed reading it. It’s been fun to write, I suppose. Stay breezy, /r/loseit.

        "body": "What an amazing transformation! **Well done!**\n\n\nI identified with lots of it, particularly the part about loving food and developing a sort of relationship with it - I was a big emotional eater. I was eating regardless the emotion; from stress eating to celebratory eating. A lot of my life revolved around food. And I identify with that general apathy you had with being fat - I was never really mistreated terribly for being larger, pretty successful with life in general and have a good group of friends and supportive family. Instant gratification was at the forefront of my mind. Behind all that though, I was/am painfully aware that maybe, just maybe, life could be better if I lost all the weight. Something clicked, and I made little changes that *finally stuck*.\n\n\nI started cutting calories like you and also kept silent about it, the moved on to keto because it was the best way for me to balance my love for food and having to eat less. And like you, I do still appreciate good food, but it's a different kind of appreciation now. It doesn't need to fill some emotional void. I started swimming and lifting, and even started jogging. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I didn't hate jogging as much as I used to. \n\n\nSo much positive changes have emerged because of that fateful day in October 2014 for me where I finally decided I wanted to make the most out of being alive. I feel a heck lot better in general, not just being able to walk for long distances but also heading out with friends and *actually enjoying* a game of frisbee and not get winded. Actually making the decision to go for a swim or a run and following through with it feels absolutely amazing. *I have become my own strongest motivator.* People are noticing and asking what my secret is, and it's nice talking to people who are genuinely curious about what I'm doing.\n\n\nAll that discipline and control is having spillovers to other aspects of my life as well - my room is neater, I get to work on time, and am handling various aspects of life so much better - relationships and general adulty things like paying the bills, not getting so panicky when things go wrong at work and so on. And the best part, it doesn't feel temporary at all. This is my life now.\n\n\nI didn't mean to hijack your post - but it's nice to finally be able to identify with someone else on so many levels.",

You have a fantastic writing style and great perspective on what helped you succeed, while allowing that what worked for you won't always work for others.\n\nI am going to say something that I hope won't be horribly age-ist, because someone who writes and thinks as well as you doesn't deserve to be pandered to with, \"well, but you're young; you don't understand what it's like when you're older.\" I went on my first diet in high school, when I was a similar age to you. At the time, Keto was not yet a glimmer in an Atkins follower's eye, and it was low-fat whole-grain all the way down. I lost about 25 lbs just by developing fairly arbitrary food rules and restrictions and paying loose attention to calorie counts that were probably very inaccurate because I didn't have access to a food scale. At the time, it was easy to devote myself to eating half-portions of everything, never having desserts, and never drinking, because I didn't drink anyway. \n\nAs I aged, and I discovered how to cook for myself, and how to drink, and began to enjoy life more, and socialize with other people rather than being a solitary loner, I gained weight. And this wasn't by eating pure junk or binge drinking or throwing away any notion of healthy eating. As a child, I grew up on a diet of reheated frozen food; my main vegetables were frozen peas and corn. In my 20s learned to cook and became somewhat of a foodie. I reached my highest ever weight while cringing at the idea of eating McDonald's food, not having purchased fast food in about a year or even having walked down the frozen pizza aisle in the grocery store. Sure, I like bread and butter and cheese a little TOO much, but my problem was really with portions and snacking as well as allowing indulgences too much of the time.\n\nWhen you consider forever, and maintaining those habits \"forever,\" what you think is sustainable may change over time. I feel that my perspective at 15 of \"forever\" is really different than now at 32. What I was willing to do then, I'm not willing to do now, because I was unaware of what I was missing out on by existing exclusively on salads, cheese sandwiches and digestive biscuits. I'm not interested in creating arbitrary restrictions around food anymore, and am instead devoted to doing the math all the time, which, when you're used to it, doesn't take all that long. If I indulge in a calorie-rich meal, I have to pay it off by not eating other meals or exercising. For me, this is working right now. \"Forever\" still freaks me out, but I still want to eat pastry occasionally and really, really enjoy that pastry, and still lose weight, and this is a way of managing that.\n\n I think you might ask yourself how you see \"forever\" if and when Keto gets too difficult to continue doing forever. Maybe that day will never come and you will blithely eat steak and eggs and broccoli into your twilight years. I'd be happy for you if that's the case. For myself, I let denial set in after I decided that I couldn't handle restriction anymore. An event would happen like a move or a new degree or a job change, my schedule would change, I'd founder and not figure out my health as a whole-picture thing. I'd only exercise without dieting, or \"cut out desserts\" for awhile and then go nuts when I decided to have them again, or find myself putting in 80 hour work weeks and binging from the stress.\n\nSo, in the future, if you find your habits slipping, it might be good to bring up the \"forever\" question. If you can't answer \"what will make me do this forever?\" it's still good to reassess what you can do to manage your weight and health when other things in life must become a priority. Obviously I don't have the solution to never falling off the wagon, but I hope this gives you some cause for reflection about the future, if you ever find life has changed and you need to re-think your approach.     \n\nCongrats on your success! And best wishes for the future.",

    "body": "Edit: I’ve removed product recommendations due to concerns over brand affiliations. I’m not affiliated with any brand but I can see how some may feel negatively towards this, especially considering some of the history on the sub for brands to exploit the readers here. \n\nI may make a separate post later with recommendations as well as a bit of a discussion around it for people who are looking for recommendations. \n\n—-\n\nHi guys!\n\nYears ago I wrote[ the sidebar'd piece about dehydrated skin that I still get tagged in today](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/22c4tf/dehydrated_skin_and_the_moisture_barrier_an/). I wanted to update that with some more detailed information and knowledge on why it happens, what is happening, et cetra. Hopefully this can replace that guide, since I feel like it was a bit too broad. :)\n\n---\n\nDehydration is characterized by a lack of hydration in the cellular system and intercellular channels of the skin. It is not a skin type, but a skin condition. It does not discriminate between dry, oily, or combination skin types, and is frequently aggravated by lifestyle and skincare choices. \n\nTo understand skin dehydration, you need to first understand the role of the natural moisturizing factors (NMF) in skin hydration. The NMF is an invisible lipid composition that sits on the top layer of the stratum corneum (SC) as well as interwoven in the top most layers of corneocytes (skin cells), making up a part in what is considered the \"acid mantle\" of the skin. The term NMF first appeared in 1959, but was not universally adopted immediately. It is hydrosoluable (able to dissolve in water) and hygroscopic (able to retain water), composed of about 40% free amino acids, 12% pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (PCA), 12% lactates, 8.5% sugars/peptides/inorganic acids, 7% urea, 6% chloride, 5% sodium, and various small amounts of other materials. \n\nIt serves three major functions:\n\n1.  Protecting skin from damage\n2.  Encouraging desquamation (exfoliation of the upper most layer of corneocytes)\n3.  Controlling permeability of the SC\n\nThe NMFs are very effective natural humectants, drawing moisture to the skin from the atmosphere, even at humidity as low as 50%. \"Hydrated NMF forms ionic interacts with keratin fibers, reducing the intermolecular forces between the fibers and thus increasing the elasticity of the stratum corneum.\"² This keeps the skin healthy and supple in appearance. It also serves to prevent excessive water influx (see the third major function above), such as when your skin wrinkles from being in the bath or shower for too long, which causes the corneocytes to shrink. \n\nWhile it is often thought that the stratum corneum is \"dead\" tissue, it still requires water to function effectively. The NMF serves to provide for this, drawing and holding much of the water required. For example, enzymes that cause skin cells to exfoliate away naturally, by breaking the various bonds holding corneocytes together, need water to do their job effectively. \n\nReduction or stripping away of the NMF results in dry skin ([known as xerosis](https://imgur.com/vBOb07w)), scaling, flaking, as well as fissuring and cracking ([such as severely cracked and dry heels](https://imgur.com/C0F7BKK)). It can also result in what we refer to as \"dehydrated skin\" (though this is not a medical term).\n\n* * *\n\nWhat Dehydration Feels Like\n===========================\n\nDehydrated skin is one of the more difficult conditions to diagnose because it is frequently invisible. There are many \"tips\" online about how to diagnose dehydrated skin, such as pinching the back of your hand to see how quickly the skin snaps back into place. *It's important to keep in mind that this only serves to show if your body is dehydrated. Dehydrated skin usually has less to do about the hydration inside of your body and more to do with how we treat the skin topically or the atmosphere around us.* This is why someone with dehydrated skin can pinch the back of their hand and see their skin immediately pop back into place, yet feel horrible irritation on their skin when applying a simple moisturizer.  \n\n[The skin usually looks dry, scaly, or flaky](https://imgur.com/cLTwbTf), and feels \"tight\" (such as after using a harsh cleanser). When pulled very gently, [it can appear to crinkle](https://imgur.com/8RRFIfj) (not to be confused with crepey skin, such as the skin appearance around joints), and can even look like it has a very thin layer of skin sitting atop the upper most layer of skin. In some people, it feels itchy. It is usually most evident on the forehead or nose. It can also look lackluster, dull, and lack \"bounce\" and suppleness. In some, it can take the form of crinkly but very shiny skin, usually due to abuse of skin remodelers like AHAs or BHAs. \n\nBoth dry and oily skin types can be dehydrated - dry skin because it struggles to hold onto moisture and oily because sufferers frequently use harsh cleansers or astringents to gain relief. According to Milady's Skin Care and Cosmetic Ingredients Dictionary, \"When oily skin becomes dehydrated, the surface layers of cells harden ... and block oil secretion. The result is an entrapment of the oils under the stratum corneum layer. This is particularly detrimental in the case of someone with acne because it also results in the entrapment of the infection.\"¹ \n\nDehydrated skin also typically responds more viciously to active ingredients, such as BHAs, AHAs, sulfur, retinoids, and vitamin C. It can also respond to completely benign ingredients, creating a burning sensation or the skin feeling flushed and hot.\n\n* * *\n\nCauses of Dehydration\n=====================\n\nThe most common culprits of dehydration of the skin is stripping cleansers, harsh soaps, and hot water, though a host of other causes can come into play for some people, including skin conditions that aggravate dry skin (again, while dehydrated skin is not the same as dry skin, dry skin is especially prone to dehydration) or create acne (which frequently causes people to \"overtreat\" the acne and strip their skin).\n\nSkin Conditions\n---------------\n\n*   Atopic dermatitis\n*   Irritant contact dermatitis\n*   Psoriasis\n*   Cutaneous lymphoma\n\nEnvironmental\n-------------\n\n*   Seasonal changes\n*   Dry air (low humidity)\n*   Flowing air (especially wind)\n*   UV radiation (tanning beds, the sun)\n*   Overwashing\n*   Age\n*   Sunburn\n*   Cigarette smoking and smoke exposure\n*   Friction (including harsh scrubbing and mechanical exfoliation tools like the Clarisonic)\n\nHeredity Disorders\n------------------\n\n*   Ichthyosis vulgaris\n*   Netherton syndrome\n\nHormonal\n--------\n\n*   Hypothyroidism\n*   Estrogen deficiency\n\nTopical\n-------\n\n*   Alcohol/isopropyl alcohol/SD alcohol/denatured alcohol\n*   Drinking alcohol\n*   Essential oils\n*   Clay masks\n*   Sodium lauryl sulfate\n*   Bar soap\n*   Astringents (particularly alcohol-based astringents)\n*   Topical medications (e.g. retinoids)\n*   Excessive AHA or BHA use\n\n* * *\n\nCaring for Dehydrated Skin\n==========================\n\nThe most important thing when solving dehydrated skin is consideration of the products you use as well as your environment. This means paying special attention to the ingredients label when shopping, being cautious about what is applied to the skin, and what your home environment is like (and potentially limiting outside exposure to harsh wind and sun). \n\nSince everything starts with your cleanser, this means picking a creamier cleanser or one with lower amounts of surfactants. I've done a whole post on cleansers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), if you'd like to read about all the various types of cleansers and how they work. The long and short of it is look for either a wipe-off cleansers, such as Albolene; an oil cleanser that emulsifies (rinses clean) in water, such as my beloved Clinique Take the Day off Balm; a creamy cleanser, such as CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser or Aquanil; or a gentle sudsing cleanser, such as Paula's Choice Hydralight or CeraVe Foaming Cleanser. Avoid washing with hot water, which reduces the size of the micelles (the molecules created from surfactants, which cluster together), allowing them to penetrate deeper into the skin and strip it further. You'll also want to completely avoid bar soaps (pH is too high), micellar water (can be much more irritating), makeup wipes (same as micellar water), and harsh cleansers that make your skin feel tight after cleansing. \n\nA general rule of thumb is to look for mild surfactants, such as decyl glucoside, or multiple surfactants, like decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside, disodium cocoyl glutamate, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, cocoyl methyl glucamide, sodium cocoyl isethionate, and lauryl lactyl lactate. \n\nMoisturizers are also a cornerstone in treating dehydrated skin. Humectants are especially important. Some humectants to look for:\n\n*   **Glycerin** - A well-established humectant, it is a clear, thick liquid that is usually sticky on it's own. It is derived from combining water and fat, usually vegetable oil. It is not typically irritating, but it can be to some people in high concentrations.\n*   **Hyaluronic Acid (HA)** - A component of glycosaminoglycan, it occurs naturally in the dermis of the skin and is thought to play a very important role in skin function. It is advertised frequently as holding up to \"1000\" times it's weight in water (citation needed). When applied, \"hyaluronic acid forms a viscoelastic film in a manner similar to the way it holds water in the intercellular matrix of dermal connective tissue.\"¹ It needs application regularly to be effective, frequently breaking down in skin 24-48 hours after application (note: this is not the case with HA injections). It is best applied to damp skin, straight out of the shower.\n*   **Urea** - While it is frequently considered more of a moisturizer or keratolytic (able to break down bonds on dead skin) ingredient, urea has humectant properties and can attract and hold moisture in the SC.\n\n* * *\n\nHealing Dehydrated Skin\n=======================\n\nArmed with the proper ingredients, skin can typically bounce back within about two weeks (14 days). Once healed, skin should be maintained with ingredients and products that are beneficial to the skin's health. \n\nWhile healing dehydrated skin, it is recommended to use the most bland routine possible and avoid trying new things and any active ingredients at all. _It should go without saying that to heal dehydrated skin, you must drop the products that are creating the problem in the first place._ If you must change out one or two products that you believe were causing your dehydration, do so slowly and one at a time, starting with any cleansers and then moving on to moisturizers. \n\nPetrolatum is helpful to some people as well, but can cause problems for others. This is possibly due to it's ability to diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin in some people, which interferes with recovery. Your mileage may vary. \n\nIt is also recommended to sleep with a humidifier if you are in a particularly dry climate. You want to shoot for somewhere between 40-60% indoor humidity, as this will prevent the humectants from drawing moisture from the deeper layers of the skin, which evaporates away.\n\n* * *\n\nSources\n=======\n\n1.

I had been using just the face wash and noticed some flaking, and then added the astringent and cetaphil for about a week before stopping.  Now my face is extremely itchy, oily, tight and dry. The tone and complexion is horrible and I've developed tons of closed comedones on my forehead. I stopped using all of the products and just started splashing water on my face. I know I should probably add a gentle cleanser and moisturizer, but I am really scared to start anything new and am kind of hoping my skin can heal itself. Would it be okay to just use something really bland like vaseline? Is it okay to not use a cleanser and a moisturizer? I am scared to add too many things. Do you have any advice? Should I see a dermatologist? Before all of this which only started about 2 months I had normal skin.",

I wish they had more flavors though - only vanilla, mint choc chip and chocolate. I'm going to make some butter roasted pecans with sea salt and add to the vanilla!\n\nHere's the nutrition label - serving size is 2/3 cup rather than the usual 1/2 cup. [Aldi's low carb ice cream](https://i.imgur.com/yjDcRVS.jpg)\n\n**Edit for some of the negative posts:**  \n\nI posted this as a cheap option for low carb ice cream, not to debate whether it's the lowest carb or if it's healthy. You don't have to eat it :)\n\n**Edit #2 - Pick your delicious poison:**\n\nCarbs per 64g (1/2 cup) + my local price:\n\n* Aldi Vanilla: 5.25g - $2.49\n\n* Halo Top Vanilla: 6g - $5.89\n\n* Enlightened Vanilla: 4g - $5.69\n\n* Rebel Vanilla: 1.3g - $7.37\n\nIngredients:\n\n* Aldi: Milk and cream, milk protein concentrate, erythritol, chicory root extract, egg yolks, glycerin, sugar, vanilla extract, locust bean gum, guar gum, monk fruit extract, vanilla bean specks, vitamin A palmitate.\n\n* Halo Top: Skim milk, eggs, erythritol, prebiotic fiber, milk protein concentrate, cream, organic cane sugar, vegetable glycerin, natural flavor, sea salt, vanilla beans, organic carob gum, organic guar gum, organic stevia leaf extract.\n\n* Enlightened: Skim milk, milk protein concentrate, erythritol, non-GMO soluble corn fiber*, cream, egg yolks, tapioca syrup, vegetable glycerin, vanilla, carob gum, guar gum, mono & diglycerides, vanilla beans, monk fruit extract.\n\n* Rebel: Cream, water, Erythritol, chicory root fiber, egg yolks, milk protein isolate, vegetable glycerin, vanilla extract, Peruvian carob gum, guar gum, monk fruit.",

    "body": "I used to post on GOMI analyzing the ingredients of different Glossier formulations and would generally comment on their product releases, but I thought I'd move to reddit for this one since I think it's more helpful here.\n\nMe: I work in the beauty industry on the product development side and because of that I'm constantly testing new products from competitors either just to keep up with the industry or when clients bring them in as comparisons. Recently I came across a product that I thought omg, I need to post this on reddit bc there are a ton of people who would probably want to know this.\n\nThis post will cover the first [Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser](https://www.glossier.com/products/milky-jelly-cleanser) dupe which is a 99.999% match, is half the price (or usually less) - and the sole difference is that it has a different fragrance.\n\nIf you look up “Glossier Milky Jelly Dupes” the one that is always coming up is the Bliss Makeup Melt Cleanser. That one is annoying because is not a real dupe at all; it’s just vaguely texturally similar and has a similar bottle, but the formulation has nearly nothing in common with Milky Jelly in any way. Kind of pointless.\n\nPresenting the last word in Milky Jelly dupes, the [ELF Bounce Back Jelly Cleanser](https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bounce-back-jelly-cleanser/57147.html?cgid=skin-cleanser#start=9). It is \\*nearly identical in every way\\* to Milky Jelly and is usually on sale for $3. Srsly.\n\nIngredients comparison:\n\nE.L.F. Bounce Back Jelly Cleanser Ingredients: Water (Aqua), PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Dipropylene Glycol, Poloxamer 184, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Betaine, Isohexadecane, Xylitylglucoside, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Juice, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Panthenol (Vb5), Hydroxyacetophenone, Isopropyl Myristate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Anhydroxylitol, Polysorbate 80, Allantoin, Xylitol, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nGlossier Milky Jelly Ingredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Propanediol, Isohexadecane, Poloxamer 184, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Xylitylglucoside, Betaine, Allantoin, Glycerin, Panthenol, Symphytum Officinale Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Anhydroxylitol, Polysorbate 80, Xylitol, Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Isopropyl Myristate, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nThese formulations are nearly identical. They have the same cleansing agents in almost exactly the same order, and even the same textural ingredients. E.L.F. was definitely duplicating the formula exactly when they were formulating.\n\nAs I've said, I've tested the E.L.F. Bounce Back Jelly Cleanser and the Milky Jelly face wash and they are nearly identical. The texture is bang-on and the use experience is the same. There is just one real difference - the Glossier cleanser uses rosewater as the scent ingredient, and the Bounce Back uses a coconut fragrance. I’m sensitive to fragrances and it doesn’t bother me at all, it’s pretty light.\n\nThe best part? The E.L.F. Bounce Back Milky Jelly dupe is $6.00 for 100ml.\n\n$6.\n\nAnd when I ordered it for testing, it was actually $3 because E.L.F. always has sales.\n\nTo compare, Glossier Milky Jelly is $18.00 for 177ml + shipping.\n\nWhere to buy the Bounce Back: it’s is a little annoying, since they don’t have it in Target, or on Amazon it seems, but you can get it on the ELF website. Here’s the link:\n\n[https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bounce-back-jelly-cleanser/57147.html?cgid=skin-cleanser#start=9](https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bounce-back-jelly-cleanser/57147.html?cgid=skin-cleanser#start=9)\n\nAlso, disclaimer: I don't work for ELF, and never have, and think most of their products are very mediocre. But this one is clearly a copy of something already tested and popular (and I don't feel bad about sharing it because the Glossier Milky Jelly was a total rip-off/copy of the LaRoche Posay Physiological Gel, soooo)",

    "body": "**15 Sunscreens for Sensitive Skin at Low Price Point (with Photos + Research!) - PART TWO**\n\nI'm back for ROUND TWO of sunscreens, with slightly different requirements and a better understanding of sunscreen formulation and effectiveness. I dove back into my research, bought 15 solid candidates, took too many photos of my face, and wrote 12,000 words about my experiences. \n\nFair warning: this is a long read. Reddit has a character limit for posts (40,000) so I split this post into five sections. The first half is here in this post, while the rest is in comments below. **When you reach the end of the post, keep scrolling!** Please also upvote the comments with the rest of the reviews so they stay at the top of the section and folks can find them more easily.\n\nI have desert-dry, sensitive skin. I suffer from seasonal eczema and allergic contact dermatitis. After a round of formal dermatological patch testing in early 2020, I know that I'm allergic to sandalwood and lanolin, and reactive to fragrance and essential oils. I've been on retinoids (Differin, then Adapalene 0.3%, now Tretinoin Micro 0.04%) since March 2018.\n\nMy selection criteria:\n\n* Low price point (I aimed for under 40 cents per ml, but I'm bad at math and made mistakes)\n* Safe for sensitive skin (must be free of fragrance and essential oils, alcohol free preferred)\n* At least SPF 50 with good UVA protection\n\nI don't want a sunscreen that I need to be precious with or careful to keep out of my eye area. I want something cosmetically elegant that I can glob on everywhere and have it just work. I don't mind some initial white cast if it fades completely. Preference for sunscreens that perform well when reapplied or worn under makeup (minimal to no pilling) but I work from home and don't go out that often, so I'm flexible on this.\n\n[Group Photo of the Whole Squad Together!](https://imgur.com/a/EmlSfAC)\n\nI have 9 chemical/organic sunscreens, 2 combination sunscreens, and 4 physical/mineral sunscreens. 4 of them are potential contenders to take over Purito Centella Green Level Unscented SPF's place on your vanity. \n\nI tried to take photos of each sunscreen on multiple days and in different lighting (indoor, outdoor, bathroom, office, etc.) to give you the clearest picture of how it looks. I also triple-checked that my phone didn't have any auto-filters turned on. I know this is fairly common with smartphones these days. I have a Google Pixel 3a.\n\n(1) SVR Cicavit+ Soothing Repairing Protective Anti-Mark Care SPF 50+\n\n(2) Bioderma Cicabio Soothing Repairing Cream SPF 50+ PPD 31\n\n(3) Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel SPF 50+ PA++++\n\n(4) Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Perfect Sun Block SPF 50+ PA++++\n\n(5) La Roche Posay Cicaplast Baume B5 SPF 50 Soothing Repairing Balm\n\n(6) OMI - Verdio UV Moisture Gel SPF 50+ PA++++\n\n(7) OMI - Verdio UV Moisture Essence SPF 50+ PA++++\n\n(8) Bioderma Photoderm Max Milk SPF 50+ PPD 42\n\n(9) Avène Solar Cream / Very High Protection Cream Skin SPF 50+ Without Perfume\n\n(10) Uriage Bariésun Ultra-Light Fluid SPF 50+\n\n(11) Black Girl Sunscreen (BGS) Kids SPF 50\n\n(12) Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer with Sunscreen SPF 50+\n\n(13) Coppertone Pure & Simple Baby SPF 50\n\n(14) Avène Sun Care SPF 50+ Mineral Milk\n\n(15) Pipette Baby Mineral Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 50\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, I treated each sunscreen exactly the same: I measured out a half teaspoon, applied on every inch of my face (up to my hairline, down my neck and décolletage, around the back of my neck, on my ears, lips, and eyelids), then reapplied a little extra to the high points of my face.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n#BEST AND WORST\n\n**Game of Centella Clones Winner**: Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel\n\n**Best Chemical/Organic Sunscreen**: SVR Cicavit+\n\n**Best Physical/Mineral Sunscreen**: Pipette Baby Mineral Sunscreen\n\n**Best Everyday Sunscreen**: Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer with SPF\n\n**Best Outdoor Exercise Sunscreen**: Uriage Bariésun Ultra-Light Fluid\n\n**Best Makeup Primer Sunscreen**: OMI Verdio UV Moisture Essence\n\n**Best Value**: Coppertone Pure & Simple Baby\n\n**Worst for Sensitive Skin**: Black Girl Sunscreen (BGS) Kids\n\n**Worst Value**: Bioderma Cicabio\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n#Missed Connections\n\nThese are sunscreens I wanted to try, but couldn't get due to stock issues, inaccessibility in my country, price increases, or I found out about them too late.

According to the brand website, this sunscreen is supposed to be \"repairing\" and \"especially formulated for the protection of damaged skin, in order to prevent the darkening process\" in the recovery phase after dermatological procedures. The brand website claims that it \"guarantees summer skin without marks,\" that it has \"invisible texture,\" and that it \"repairs skin 7x faster\" compared to untreated skin. That implies a high level of both UVA and UVB protection, and the combination of filters backs up that claim. I have seen several mentions on Reddit that this product has a PPD value of 40+ but I wasn't able to find a good source to corroborate this.\n\nUvasorb HEB (Iscotrizinol) is a nearly perfect UVB filter. It requires relatively low concentrations to achieve high SPF values and it is one of the most photostable chemical sunscreens, with 25 hours required to lose 10% of its SPF protection ability. In contrast, other \"photostable\" filters reach that point in just two hours. Uvasorb HEB is also present in the Avène Solar Cream sunscreen, as well as many other Avène products.\n\nThe antioxidant and soothing ingredients include polysaccharide (prebiotic sugar), carrot root extract, niacinamide, and caffeyl glucoside (antioxidant with anti-inflammatory and photoprotective effects).\n\n**Impressions**: After falling in and out of love with the Purito Green Level SPF, I started my search with EU sunscreens that also contain centella/cica, the star ingredient in the Purito product. Due to inadequate prior research, I assumed that any product with \"cica\" in the name contained centella asiatica (madecassoside). That assumption proved correct for the Bioderma Cicabio product (below), but not for the SVR one! The SVR Cicavit product line actually does not contain centella.\n\nThis sunscreen is a very close match to the Purito in terms of texture, tolerability, and performance – despite the missing key ingredient. It's a thicker, colorless cream and a little more difficult to spread, which is reassuring because it means it creates a more robust barrier on my skin. It absorbs into my skin but leaves a light protective barrier, which I quite like. There is zero white cast, it masks redness the way the Purito does, and it never caused an eczema flare-up after wearing it every day for a week. It's easy to apply a lot of this stuff (even more than the recommended amount) without becoming greasy or cakey. It's more nourishing than the Purito, and my skin never felt dry or tight even after 12 hours of wear and multiple reapplications. \n\nThe true test came when I wore this to the salon to get my hair cut in January (the first time since Covid began). Even after sitting under one of those hot hair dryer dome things for 15 minutes, my skin didn't get red or itchy the way it usually does (hot air is a trigger for me). In that case, the SVR Cicavit+ is protective, something I really need in the wintertime! It also worked great with makeup, as long as I didn't wait too long to apply my foundation. \n\nThe only downside is that it tends to pill up after wearing for a few hours, so I need to be really careful not to touch my face at all or it'll start to ball up and fall off. It's better to reapply by patting it in, rather than rubbing. It's also significantly smaller than the Purito bottle, but at the same price point. I wish this came in a larger bottle. Despite these negatives, this is a winner for me! Even after trying all of the other sunscreens, this is the one that I reach for the most often. I've already repurchased another bottle and plan to continue using it long-term. I especially love the next-generation filters and (possibly) super-high UVA protection.\n\nIf you're not sure which SVR sunscreen is right for you, check out [this review post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EuroSkincare/comments/l10rtd/svr_sunscreens_review_spf_50/) by /u/_Tiny_Penguin_ that discusses three SVR sunscreens, including the Cicavit+ one. They have combination skin that doesn't vibe with the richness of this sunscreen, so they prefer SVR Sun Secure Invisible Fluid Dry Touch. According to [this review](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/loouvz/review_a_review_of_5_different_european_sunscreens/) by /u/jeong_life, SVR Sensifine Air Creme is less heavy/greasy than the SVR Cicavit+ so that might also be a good option for combo or oily skin. \n\n**Ingredients**: [INCI Decoder](https://incidecoder.com/products/svr-cicavit-creme-spf-50-soothing-repairing-protective-anti-mark-care)\n\n**Price**: $16.04 for 40 ml ($0.40 per ml)\n\n**Photos**: [Click here](https://imgur.com/a/i0GZLjN)\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**(2) Bioderma Cicabio Soothing Repairing Cream SPF50+ PPD 31**\n\n**Filters**: Uvinul A Plus, Homosalate, Octinoxate, Octisalate, Uvinul T 150, Tinosorb S \n\n**Key Facts**: Fragrance Free, Alcohol Free, Essential Oil Free\n\n**Marketing Claims**: The ingredients list is fabulous – hyaluronic acid, glycerin, centella asiatica, madecassoside, oh my! It also contains Antalgicine (a proprietary ingredient) that's supposed to \"regulate skin reactivity\" and \"relieve discomfort and the urge to scratch.\" \n\nCentella asiatica (also known as brahmi, Asiatic pennywort, tiger grass, and gotu kola) is one of my favorite skincare ingredients. Centella has potent antioxidant properties, is a rich source of amino acids, can help repair the moisture barrier, and may mitigate some of the visible effects of sun damage. It increases synthesis of collagen, improves tensile strength of newly formed skin, and inhibits the inflammatory phase of hypertrophic scars and keloids. (Source: [Advances in Dermatology and Allergology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3834700/) and [Paula's Choice](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/ingredient-spotlight/centella-asiatica-for-skin.html)) \n\nThe marketing for the Bioderma Cicabio cream says that it's \"ideal for use after dermatological procedures, and in instances of irritation, redness and overheating.\" This aligns with research on centella asiatica, so it seems like a reasonable claim.\n\n**Impressions**: This is the first contender for the champion sunscreen that will take Purito's centella-scented throne. Should we call it... Game of Centella Clones? (That was a poorly executed pun, forgive me.)\n\nI put this review immediately after the SVR Cicavit+ review so you'd still have it in your mind when you read about Bioderma's version of a centella sunscreen. The short answer is that this stuff is inferior to the SVR product, although I can't really tell you why that is. It's easy to apply, feels nice on my skin, and has no whitecast. The product itself is clearly green in color, but it goes on clear right away with zero effort. The combination of filters is really nice, so it offers great UVA/UVB protection. It also gives long-lasting moisture from the HA and glycerin.\n\nThe problem is that it irritated the heck out of my dry skin. It resurrected eczema patches on my face that I thought were totally healed. You can see a couple of these spots in the photos, bright red and angry on my cheek and temple. After an hour of wear, my eyes started to burn, so I had to wash it off. It's similar to my experience with another Bioderma product in this list, the Photoderm Max Milk. Why, Bioderma? Why do your sunscreens suck for me? This stuff *should* have been great, and it's probably perfectly fine for everyone but me. If you've used Bioderma products in the past and had a good experience, you will most likely like this.\n\nThis sunscreen is the worst value of all the products I tried. 30 ml is only enough sunscreen for 12 days if you use 1/2 tsp each day. That means you'll spend more than $32 for one month of sunscreen. It is a good size to keep in my bag to use as hand cream when I'm out and about, which is how I'm using this up. It's a pretty bomb hand cream, but not worth the price. \n\n**Ingredients**: [INCI Decoder](https://incidecoder.com/products/bioderma-cicabio-cream-spf50-30ml)\n\n**Price**: $17.81 for 30 ml ($0.59 per ml)\n\n**Photos**: [Click here](https://imgur.com/a/EuLRE2S)\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**(3) Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Filters**: Octisalate, Homosalate, Tinosorb S, Tinosorb M, Uvinul A Plus, Parsol SLX \n\n**(4) Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Perfect Sun Block SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Filters**: Titanium Dioxide\n\nHere are the second and third contenders in the Game of Centella Clones. This is a joint review! Like the Verdio sunscreens (below), I couldn't really tell which one of these hyaluronic acid centella sunscreens would be best for me, so I decided to get both. One of them is a chemical sunscreen (watery sun gel) and the other is a physical sunscreen (perfect sun block). The formulas are similar enough that it makes more sense for me to discuss them together in a compare/contrast style, rather than repeating myself in two separate reviews. \n\nI want to be clear on pricing – retail price for both of these products is $20–$26 USD, which is above my price limit. However, during Jolse's Chinese New Year sale in February, they were 50% off and I was able to grab both for $26 combined. Jolse and Yesstyle have sales all the time, so I believe this more affordable price will be accessible, given some patience. Once you've tried it, it's a good idea to stock up on 5+ bottles at a time when the price is right. \n\n**Key Facts**: Fragrance Free, Alcohol Free, Essential Oil Free\n\n**Marketing Claims**: Both sunscreens are packed with soothing and hydrating ingredients: EIGHT variants of hyaluronic acid (small, medium, and large molecule size), centella asiatica, niacinamide, ceramides, lactobacillus ferment lysate filtrate (probiotic with soothing and anti-redness properties), pycnogenol (antioxidant derived from pine bark), and purslane extract (succulent plant with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, rich in omega-3 fatty acids). \n\nAccording to [this article by Lab Muffin](https://labmuffin.com/what-is-hyaluronic-acid-and-how-does-it-work/), \"smaller molecules are able to penetrate the skin better than larger molecules, which means that low molecular weight hyaluronic acid can hydrate deeper than high molecular weight hyaluronic acid, which holds onto water at the surface of the skin.\"\n\nThe brand product pages say that the products passed a skin irritation test with a score of 0.0, which makes them hypoallergenic, according to the COREDERM Skin Research Center. The product pages do not elaborate on the testing process, so we have to take that at face value.\n\nThe perfect sun block is marketed for sensitive skin for soothing and brightening purposes, while the watery sun gel is marketed for dry skin for moisturizing and softening purposes. I feel like the Venn diagram of dry skin versus sensitive skin in this context is basically a circle. In theory, the chemical filters in the sun gel might potentially be irritating to very sensitive folks, who might have an easier time with physical blockers.\n\nI like the next-generation filters in the sun gel. It includes a \"hybrid\" filter (Tinosorb M) that's halfway between a physical blocker and a chemical agent. It works in partnership with the other next-gen filter (Tinosorb S) to provide excellent UVA/UVB spectrum coverage. It also has Parsol SLX (Polysilicone-15), which is a new one for me; I don't think I've tried a sunscreen with this filter yet. Launched in 2008, it's a silicone-based UVB absorber. This sun gel also contains Uvinul A Plus, an awesome UVA blocker. I'm super impressed by the sheer number of filters packed into this sunscreen! It seems to me like it provides layers of redundant protection for both UVA and UVB with both old-school US filters and next-generation EU filters. I wish we knew more about the percentages used.\n\nAs for the perfect sun block, it has only one filter (Titanium). While Titanium doesn’t provide as much protection from long-wave UVA rays as Zinc, it is still effective at blocking short-wave UVA and UVB. [Read more about this here](https://www.colorescience.com/blogs/learn/zinc-oxide-titanium-dioxide). There is one other Titanium-only sunscreen in this list (Avène Mineral Milk) for comparison. I don't want to spoil that review, but I will say that Titanium is known for causing pretty bad white cast. As far as I'm concerned, both Isntree products are likely to provide good broad-spectrum protection, so it comes down to how they perform in real life and which one is more cosmetically elegant.\n\n**Impressions**: The **watery sun gel** was my most-anticipated purchase. It has everything I like and nothing I can't tolerate, with a bunch of nifty next-generation filters. It's a thin, opaque gel that goes on clear right away. The name \"watery gel\" is perfectly accurate because it feels just like water on my skin, with a slight cooling effect as it dries and absorbs. I was a little wary about the amount of protection in such a cosmetically elegant sunscreen, so I went ahead and applied two layers to start. It never felt thick or cakey; it didn't feel any different from applying a single layer even when I put on five fingers' worth of product. It has a satin (leaning matte) finish after it dries down, which takes less than five minutes. Other reviews have called the finish dewy, but this wasn't my experience. If you tried Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence and loved the way it feels but didn't like the high ethanol content, you should definitely pick this up. \n\nI had an active, itchy eczema patch on my right cheek on the first day I tested this. I was about two weeks into this flare-up and didn't want to wait any longer to test out my fancy new sunscreens. I was interested to see whether this would irritate the area, make it more red, or cause bumpiness. Was this a stupid risk? Yes. If you have active eczema, you probably shouldn't be trying out new skincare products. It's like playing a game of chicken with the devil. The results: it didn't make my patch of eczema any worse, and it didn't cause it to burn or itch. It was inoffensive, which is one of the best things I can say about a sunscreen.\n\nI encourage you to also read [this review of the hyaluronic sun gel](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/ltv9ro/isntree_hyaluronic_acid_watery_sun_gel_spf50_pa/) by /u/uv-ux from a few months ago. Their impressions are quite similar to mine. James Welsh also reviewed this product in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO9wBNImFqc&ab_channel=JamesWelsh). He says, \"it's everything I expect from a Korean sunscreen\" and \"Isntree is a brand that never disappoints me.\"\n\nLater, once my eczema patch was more healed, I tried the **perfect sun block**. As expected, this one was a light cream in texture. It goes on chalk white and it takes a little while for the white cast to fade. It felt a little tacky for a while before it dried down completely, which took roughly 10 minutes. At first I thought that the cast did fade completely (I couldn't see it IRL) but you can clearly see it in the photos. I didn't apply this around the back of my neck so I could compare the sunscreen areas with bare skin. There's definitely a faint white cast, even after 20-30 minutes of waiting. I also saw some remaining chalkiness around my hairline. It rubbed off white streaks on my clothes; this is most visible on the day I wore a black t-shirt. \n\nI've tried far worse mineral sunscreens so I'm not mad about this. It's perfectly fine for days when I hang out at home by myself with the doggos. However, if you're going to buy a mineral sunscreen, I would recommend choosing one with Zinc rather than Titanium, or a very small amount of Titanium. It seems like white cast is more or less unavoidable with Titanium. \n\nI recommend watching [this review video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOTinWpVrZo&t=481s&ab_channel=MySkincareRegime) of all three Isntree hyaluronic acid sunscreens (there's also a stick one). You can see side-by-side comparisons of product applications and finishes. \n\n**Ingredients**: [INCI Decoder for GEL](https://incidecoder.com/products/isntree-hyaluronic-acid-watery-sun-gel) and [INCI Decoder for BLOCK](https://incidecoder.com/products/isntree-hyaluronic-acid-perfect-sun-block)\n\n**Price**: $16.71 for 60 ml ($0.27 per ml)\n\n**Photos**: [Isntree Watery Sun Gel](https://imgur.com/a/XHTFwY9) and [Isntree Perfect Sun Block](https://imgur.com/a/ThgSGGO)\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**(5) La Roche Posay Cicaplast Baume B5 SPF50 Soothing Repairing Balm**\n\n**Filters**: Homosalate, Octisalate, Avobenzone, Octocrylene, Tinosorb S, Uvinul T 150, Ensulizole, Mexoryl XL \n\n**Key Facts**: Fragrance Free, Essential Oil Free, Contains Alcohol Denat.

The sunscreen version is described as a \"dual action formula\" ideal for \"all kinds of everyday skin irritations and minor everyday injuries caused by daily aggressions.\" (What is an \"aggression\" in this context? Walking to the mailbox without SPF? Looking out the window on a sunny day?) There is no explanation provided for what \"dual action\" means, although my hunch is they're referring to sunscreen + moisture but trying to make it sound high-tech. It has EIGHT sunscreen filters, which frankly might be overkill even for me. I have to assume the percentages used are super low, right?\n\nAccording to the product description, this is a \"lightweight formula [that] absorbs fast, avoiding any sticky, greasy residue.\" Based on the ingredients list, I believe this counts as an occlusive, as well as a moisturizer and sunscreen. A true multitasking extraordinaire, it might be a \"one and done\" product for your AM routine. It has one of LRP's favorite ingredients, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), as well as madecassoside, glycerin, zinc, and thermal spring water.  \n\nLa Roche Posay is part of L'Oréal Group, which means some of its profit goes to Nestlé.\n\n**Impressions**: This is the fourth contender for the Game of Centella Clones throne. Like many others here, I quite like the original Cicaplast Baume and used it liberally until I found an alternative that works better for me – Aveeno Baby Nighttime Eczema Balm, which I get in a giant tub. Oatmeal > centella in my book, although I like both ingredients a lot.\n\nDo the wealth of moisturizing and soothing ingredients make up for the alcohol in this product? I'm sensitive to alcohol in my skincare and usually flush red when exposed to it. Like all the other sunscreens on this list, I patch tested this on the inside of my wrist for three days. I expected it to smell like a perfume sample but I didn't catch even the faintest whiff of alcohol. That was a very promising start! \n\nIn terms of texture, it's virtually identical to the original Cicaplast Baume. The cream is opaque white but rubs in clear. I think it's strange that the directions say to \"avoid lips and eye contour areas\" because this is supposedly a product for your face, so why would you do that? I went ahead and applied it all over my face anyway because I'm a loose cannon cop who doesn't play by the rules. It also says it's suitable for adults and children, but not babies. Is the alcohol the problem?\n\nAs it turns out, the alcohol was indeed the problem, but not the only one. This stuff refused to blend on my lips, leaving an unattractive dry white glaze. What's more, it was also incredibly difficult to blend this into my face because it dried down way too quickly. By the time I finished rubbing it into my forehead, it had already dried on my cheeks. Any attempt to touch those areas again caused major pilling. I'm talking a matter of under 30 seconds from squeezing the cream on my fingers to having it bone-dry on my face. You can see that in the photos–pilling all over my cheeks and redness everywhere else. Usability is seriously an issue here, especially for dry skin. The marketing is actually accurate in that regard – it does absorb super fast and it does not leave a sticky or greasy residue. The problem is that the process happens so quickly that it's too difficult to get a smooth, even layer of product before it's too late and you're stuck with the sunscreen equivalent of dandruff.\n\nFor a product that's supposed to be soothing and hydrating, it also fails hard in that regard. My skin felt seriously irritated. I felt red bumpy patches on my cheeks in the first half hour; these started to itch not soon after. Later that evening, my cheeks erupted with heat and redness, almost exactly like if I had drunk a glass of red wine while eating Thai curry. (If you know, you know.) If you have rosacea or eczema, this is not your friend.\n\nThere aren't any long-form or video reviews out there for the SPF 50 version, but the short reviews I could find on third-party sites were fairly consistent. Several people complained of the white cast and of feeling greasy. I didn't personally feel greasy even a little bit, even applying a substantial amount of it on my face. YMMV on this one.\n\n**Ingredients**: [INCI Decoder](https://incidecoder.com/products/la-roche-posay-cicaplast-baume-b5-spf50)\n\n**Price**: $9.85 for 40 ml ($0.24 per ml)\n\n**Photos**: [Click here](https://imgur.com/a/LHMacxY)\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**(6) OMI - Verdio UV Moisture Gel SPF 50+ PA++++**\n\n**Filters**: Titanium Dioxide, Octinoxate, Uvinul A Plus, Uvinul T 150, Tinosorb S \n\n**(7) OMI - Verdio UV Moisture Essence SPF 50+ PA++++**\n\n**Filters**: Octinoxate, Octocrylene, Uvinul A Plus, Tinosorb S \n\nThis will be another joint review, covering both products and their differences.\n\n**Key Facts**: Fragrance Free, Alcohol Free, Essential Oil Free, Dye Free, Paraben Free, Waterproof\n\n**Marketing Claims**: Verdio doesn't have an English-language website, so I relied on product descriptions on third-party seller sites. According to the product marketing, both the gel and the essence are waterproof and sweatproof, and protect against \"environmental stressors, pollen, and particulate matter (PM) pollution.\" Both products have several plant-derived antioxidants and anti-inflammatories, including green tea, Chinese skullcap root, moringa, and pearl barley. The gel has more ingredients, but largely the composition is the same. Based on the filters, it looks like the gel might offer better protection, but at the potential cost of white cast from the titanium. \n\nI'd like to say a few things about Octocrylene. This is a super-popular sunscreen filter that blocks both UVA and UVB rays. It's included in five sunscreens in this review. According to recent research, this organic compound can penetrate into the skin where it acts as a photosensitizer, which results in an increased production of free radicals. (Source: [Free Radical Biology & Medicine](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9f14s2dd)) Another study found that Octocrylene degrades into a toxic chemical that is a known carcinogen and endocrine disruptor (benzophenone). (Source: [Chemical Research in Toxicology](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrestox.0c00461)) You can read a more in-depth discussion on this topic in [this blog post](http://cyrillelaurent.com/2019/06/09/sunscreen-in-your-blood/) by Cyrille Laurent. Cyrille comes to the conclusion that the fear-mongering around Octocrylene is overblown and that the ingredient has not been proven unsafe. I think it's worth it to be cautious, but I wouldn't dismiss Octocrylene altogether because it's hard to avoid, especially for U.S. consumers.\n\n**Impressions**: I tried the **essence** first. It smells like green tea! I drink green tea with ginger every morning and I love the scent. This product does not contain synthetic fragrance, so one can assume that there's a good amount of actual green tea in the product formulation. It's a light green gel-cream that goes on clear instantly with no rubbing required. Like most Japanese sunscreens, it's incredibly cosmetically elegant. I could put on multiple layers with zero fuss. It feels moisturizing and soothing, much more so than the LRP Cicaplast product and comparable to Purito centella sun. It does not do anything to mitigate redness. It's one of the most comfortable sunscreens I tried, in that I didn't mind wearing it all day and slapping more on every couple hours. It didn't dry out my skin or irritate it as I wore it, which is a big plus for me. Also, no pilling!\n\nI think this is a pretty good dupe for the Canmake Mermaid Skin Gel UV, but without the tacky skin feel and without the glittery-shimmery effect. It's an excellent base for makeup and didn't move around or separate when I applied concealer and foundation on top. I tested it by using it as a primer for a full face of makeup on a warm, foggy day with 100% humidity and 5+ UV Index. My base stayed put and didn't separate while drinking outdoors at a brewery in the hottest part of the day and taking my mask on/off multiple times. \n\nOverall, the Verdio UV Moisture Essence is an excellent, cost-effective option for sensitive skin if you don't mind the light green tea scent and need something that performs well under makeup.\n\nThen, I tried the **gel** another day. I was looking for white cast, as Titanium tends to be problematic. I can't be sure how much of this filter is included in the formulation, so it could feasibly have very little. My first impression was that the name is a misnomer; this isn't a gel at all. It's actually more like a runny milk in texture, much like Skin Aqua Super Moisture Milk (also a combination sunscreen). It has no discernable scent, unlike the essence. It goes on clear right away, which allowed me to apply multiple thin layers right off the bat. No white cast!\n\nIt was lightly moisturizing, did not irritate active eczema, and left a glossy film on my skin. Over the first hour, my skin did become less shiny but did not become all the way matte. However, at the same time, it started to ball up on the baby hairs on my neck and around my hairline. I don't think it was visible to other people but I could feel the little clumps of product and it bothered me. This is probably not the best for people with facial hair. The best part about this product is that it's CHEAP and comes in a larger bottle than the standard Japanese sunscreen. \n\nHead to head, I would recommend the essence over the gel as it's more cosmetically elegant and it wears better over time. However, both are very good options if you have sensitive skin.\n\nIn [this video by Raw Tin Skin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jysf3rwP1s4&ab_channel=RawTinSkin), he compares both of the products in a side-by-side, head-to-head review. He also had a tough time discerning the difference between them, so the video includes a full ingredient breakdown. \n\n**Ingredients**: [INCI Decoder for GEL](https://incidecoder.com/products/omi-verdio-uv-moisture-gel-spf-50-pa] and [INCI Decoder for ESSENCE](https://incidecoder.com/products/omi-verdio-uv-moisture-essence-spf-50-pa)\n\n**Price**: GEL is $13.90 for 80 ml ($0.17 per ml) and ESSENCE is $10.90 for 50 ml ($0.21 per ml)\n\n**Photos**: [Verdio Essence](https://imgur.com/a/wEECoQK) and [Verdio Gel](https://imgur.com/a/qwp1Nsu)\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**(8) Bioderma Photoderm Max Milk SPF 50+ PPD 42**\n\n**Filters**: Octocrylene, Tinosorb M, Avobenzone, Tinosorb S\n\n**Key Facts**: Fragrance Free, Alcohol Free, Essential Oil Free, Paraben Free\n\n**Marketing Claims**: Bioderma's Photoderm Max line is top-shelf in terms of UVA protection. It offers spectacular broad-spectrum protection by (jargon incoming) \"erecting a double barrier to encourage its immunity against the sun: the best of external protection as well as unique, patented and laboratory-tested Cellular Bioprotection.\" I'm assuming that the \"double barrier\" in this sense is the base of chemical filters (Octocrylene, Avobenzone), followed by a second layer of next-generation hybrid filters (Tinosorb M, Tinosorb S). Octocrylene and Tinosorb S are present to stabilize the Avobenzone, which is unreliable on its own. The brand also boasts about a \"patented prebiotic complex\" but I wasn't able to determine what exactly that is. \n\n**Impressions**: I really, really wanted to like this stuff. I bought it last summer before going on a beach trip because I wanted the highest-possible UVA protection. In that regard, it's awesome, with a fantastic PPD rating and excellent combination of filters. (I believe the P20 Kids sunscreen actually has a higher PPD rating with 50+.) \n\nAnd now for the bad: It's impossible to make this stuff work for me. It refuses to blend on my skin, so it looks like I have grey-white patches all over. It also burns the living hell out of my eyes, to the point where I cry when I apply it. Even worse, it doesn't set after 20-30 minutes, so every time something brushed my face it came back streaked with white. In the photos, it looks okay in natural light with cloud cover (which mutes and softens the light) but horrible in direct light from my bathroom vanity or sunlight through a window. \n\nThe only way I could use this is to apply it as a second layer, above a thinner and more cosmetically elegant sunscreen (Purito, before I knew it was inadequate). I used this as a topper, patting it carefully on the highest points of my face and my shoulders before going out into the sun. In that regard, it was fine. I might not have applied enough to make a difference, but I felt more protected. I think this is the end of the road for my relationship with Bioderma sunscreens. They just don't vibe with me. \n\nBefore discounting this product entirely, you should read [this review by Lab Muffin](https://labmuffin.com/sunscreen-review-2-bioderma-la-roche-posay/), which compares it to La Roche-Posay Anthelios Melt-In Cream (EU).

        "body": "#MORE REVIEWS -- Part Six\n\n#Head-to-Head Comparison - Mineral Sunscreens\n\nI have Aveeno Positively Mineral SPF 50 and Australian Gold Botanical SPF 50 Mineral Lotion (untinted) in my bathroom. I don't like either of these products because the white cast they produce is egregious and they have zero cosmetic elegance. I decided to put those on my arms, alongside the Pipette, Avène, and Coppertone representatives.\n\n[Here are swatches of all five mineral sunscreens.](https://imgur.com/a/mBWKGAL) I tried my best to use equal amounts of each product, although they varied in texture/thickness. The first photo shows the blobs right out of the bottles. The second photo shows them blended out so you can see how much area each one covers. The third photo shows them blended in all the way (by tapping with two fingers) after a 10 minute wait for them to dry down completely.\n\n**Pipette was the most invisible, closely followed by Coppertone.** They would be tied, but I know Coppertone had a visible cast on my face so I have to factor that in. The Coppertone one looked much better on my arm versus my face; I didn't see the grey tone at all and it looked just like regular skin. Maybe it doesn't vibe with one of my AM skincare products and performs better on bare skin. I like what I see and I'm going to use it up as a body sunscreen in the summer. \n\n**Avène and Aveeno were tied for the worst white cast.** The Aveeno also clung to the hairs on my arms (zoom in and you'll see it) so my skin looked bumpy, like chicken flesh. I think it's interesting that three of these (Aveeno, Pipette, and Coppertone) all contain 20%+ zinc, but performed very differently in terms of white cast. The Australian Gold had a slight cast but it wasn't anything terrible, perhaps because it's a titanium/zinc mix. I'm a little iffy about the protection with just 4% of each filter.\n\n**Pipette felt the most moisturizing and Aveeno felt the most drying**, with the other three somewhere in the middle. The Avène sunscreen provided a good amount of moisture but it never dried down, even after an hour of wear while I did some chores around the house. It continued to smear around and transfer onto my clothes. I think the Aveeno formulation is all-around terrible but it did dry down relatively quickly and didn't create a mess. I would rank the Australian Gold higher because of its less-awful white cast. If you can tolerate eucalyptus oil and have a good shade match in the tinted sunscreen line, you should just buy that instead. \n\nOverall rankings:\n\n1. Pipette Baby Mineral\n2. Coppertone Pure & Simple Baby\n3. Australian Gold Botanical Untinted\n4. Aveeno Positively Mineral\n5. Avène Mineral Milk\n\nAfter I did this whole experiment, I realized that I forgot about the Instree Perfect Sun Block, which is a titanium-only sunscreen. (Sucks to suck.) I don't want to do this again but if anyone really wants to see how it compares, ask me and I'll put something together.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n#FAQ\n\nBased on the PMs I received on the previous mega review post, I want to proactively address some common queries. Feel free to reply to this comment with follow-up questions.\n\n**What's your skincare routine?**\n\nAM\n\n* Vanicream gentle cleanser\n* Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid (chin and nose)\n* The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid + B5\n* Aveeno Calm + Restore Triple Oat Serum\n* Vanicream Lite Lotion\n* Sunscreeeeeeen\n\nPM\n\n* Garnier micellar water pink cap (first cleanse, when I need it)\n* Vanicream gentle cleanser\n* TO Hyaluronic Acid\n* Vanicream in the tub\n* Tretinoin Micro 0.04%\n* Eucrisa (Rx ointment for eczema) – sometimes I use this in the morning too\n* Aveeno Baby Nighttime Eczema Balm\n* Vaseline\n\n**What does your fantasy sunscreen look like? What special ingredients does it have?**\n\n[My all-time favorite skincare ingredient is oatmeal.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tretinoin/comments/bf0nor/experiencing_irritation_consider_oatmeal/) My ideal sunscreen is a vegan, hydrating, water-based cream that contains avena sativa/colloidal oatmeal, hyaluronic acid, and a centella/cica derivative. It has a short-ish ingredients list, uses straightforward marketing language, and is safe for babies. It has at least three next-generation filters and does not include Titanium. If I'm truly shooting for the stars here, I'd like the PPD rating to be 40+ (but I'll settle for 20+). If the SVR Cicavit+ sunscreen contained oatmeal and centella, that would be game over for me.\n\nAveeno Protect + Hydrate Sunscreen Lotion SPF 70 and Innisfree Oat Mild Moisture Sun Cream SPF 50+ PA+++ are the closest matches on the market today, but both products have their flaws. First Aid Beauty also has some nice sunscreens with oatmeal, but nothing higher than SPF 30 and they're quite pricey for what you get. If Krave makes an SPF 50+ version of their oatmeal gel-cream, I'll buy it no matter what they charge for it. Oat So Simple sucks as a moisturizer but it would make for a stellar sunscreen.\n\n**What complexion/base makeup do you use? Are they also fragrance/alcohol/EO free?**\n\nYes, I like to put on a face of makeup for special occasions, which were few and far between in 2020 due to COVID. It's difficult to find fragrance free and essential oil free foundations. Citrus oils seem to be jammed into everything these days. I currently use The Ordinary serum foundation or coverage foundation, depending on what I need that day. Both retail for $7. I use shade 1.2P. I'm interested in trying ILIA foundations but they're so expensive...\n\nPreviously, before my dermatological patch testing, I was using MAC Face + Body (N1), Dr Jart Premium Beauty Balm (gold bottle, forgot the shade), or It Cosmetics CC+ Cream in Fair Light. All of these contain citrus essential oils so I threw them out after receiving my patch test results.\n\nFor concealer, I use Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer in Vanilla. It's the first concealer I ever tried (thank you, helpful Ulta employee in 2014) and I saw no reason to try anything else until this January, when The Ordinary launched their concealer. I'm trying that one out now. It's fine, but more difficult to blend and the shade match isn't quite right. It's only $6 versus Nars at $30 so I'm determined to make it work. \n\nFor primer, Hylamide Photography Foundation in transparent. I also like Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Flawless Filter. The mini size is only $15 and it should last me a whole year.",

The brand page also says that this is \"VERY water-resistant\" so this could be a good option for swimming, beach trips, and other sweaty activities.\n\nThere's some controversy around the safety of nano particles and whether they are absorbed into the bloodstream. [This literature review study from 2017](https://www.tga.gov.au/literature-review-safety-titanium-dioxide-and-zinc-oxide-nanoparticles-sunscreens) offers up-to-date evidence on this topic. In the abstract, it says \"systemic absorption, hence toxicity, is highly unlikely... on current evidence, neither TiO2 nor ZnO NPs are likely to cause harm when used as ingredients in sunscreens and when sunscreens are used as directed.\" \n\n**Impressions**: I'm not going to bury the lede – do not buy this. This is a \"deceptive\" sunscreen. When I first squeezed it out, I noticed a peachy tint to the mostly white cream. I thought that was a promising sign of minimal white cast. I read reviews on Amazon and LovelySkin that praised the way it blends into their skin, so I was pretty sure this would be a BB cream situation, or maybe something similar to the Australian Gold tinted mineral sunscreen. \n\nI could have not been more wrong. I'm going to ask you to scroll down and click on the photos I took before reading further; a picture is worth a thousand words, and boy I have a lot to say. The white cast is absurdly bad. [This is an accurate depiction of what I looked like.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/62/6b/48/626b48060c919023cf32552768fa5075.jpg)\n\nI swear that I used the correct amount of product, equal to every other mineral sunscreen. In fact, I may have used a bit less, as I didn't apply any extra to the tops of my cheekbones or around the back of my neck. It's chalk white, does not blend in, does not absorb, and does not dry down with time. Further efforts to rub it into my skin only succeeded in rubbing it OFF onto my hands, which defeats the purpose of wearing sunscreen. It got all over the collar of my sweater (my husband's sweater, actually, thank you honey) in just a few minutes. Where was the \"cream to powder\" texture? I just saw cream. \n\nI tolerated it on my face for an hour before washing it off. That was also a strenuous process. It's very, very waterproof, so my usual approach of Vanicream cleanser + water did nothing. I went in with liberal amounts of micellar water and managed to remove most of it, then followed with even more cleanser. Oil cleansing is probably best. If you want a product that doesn't budge when you go scuba diving, this is the one for you.\n\nWho is this sunscreen meant for? Who is the target consumer? At least with the Coppertone and Pipette mineral sunscreens, we can say that they're meant for babies who don't care about white cast or cosmetic elegance. Avène markets this stuff to adults!\n\nBack to the reviews I read before my purchase – one verified customer said that \"You barely need more than a drop,\" a second person said \"a very small amount goes a long way,\" and another said they like to \"add a bit of glow with liquid bronzer.\" Someone on Amazon said in their review that \"I just put enough to cover all the areas of my face/neck.\" The obvious conclusion here is that these satisfied customers were using a tiny amount, far less than they should. We know for a fact that [SPF changes with how much sunscreen you use](https://labmuffin.com/spf-changes-how-much-sunscreen-use/). Applying half the recommended amount of SPF 50 sunscreen cannot give you more than SPF 10. \n\nSimilarly, mixing sunscreen with other products (even other sunscreens) can disrupt the formula, destabilize the filters, and impact the amount of protection you get. Dermablend recently came under fire for instructing consumers to mix their Flawless Creator Drops into sunscreen, and has since purged all mentions of this feature from their marketing (some remnants are still on Instagram). Hyram even demonstrated this technique in a video a while ago, so I don't think this is a widely-known fact. If you didn't know... now you do!\n\n**Ingredients**: [INCI Decoder](https://incidecoder.com/products/avene-mineral-cream-spf-50)\n\n**Price**: $13.73 for 100ml ($0.13 per ml)\n\n**Photos**: [Click here](https://imgur.com/a/k6OIril)\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**(15) Pipette Baby Mineral Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 50**\n\n**Filters**:  Non-nano Zinc Oxide (20%) (Mineral Sunscreen)\n\n**Key Facts**: Vegan, Cruelty Free, Fragrance Free, Alcohol Free, Essential Oil Free, Reef Safe\n\n**Marketing Claims**: I saw this sunscreen start popping up on Instagram last year. It's enjoyed a considerable amount of hype in the past few months. This all-zinc sunscreen is described as having no white cast! In addition, it contains a healthy amount of bisabolol (an active component of chamomile), squalane, and glycerin for moisturizing and soothing purposes. Pipette is a brand for babies and mothers and this is clearly marketed as safe for small children.\n\n**Impressions**: Loyal, persistent readers, I saved the best for last. (Thank you for reading this far, I love you.) As soon as I unwrapped the sunscreen, I popped it open and squirted some on the back of my hand. As I rubbed it in, I literally said \"what the fuck\" out loud as it disappeared. Within 10 seconds, it was invisible. The first time I applied it to my face (several days later, after my patch testing) I was slightly disappointed to find that there was actually a bit of white cast, especially around my hairline. You can see that in the last set of photos (bright blue shirt). \n\nThen, I discovered the solution that makes this stuff truly invisible: it reacts with HEAT. According to a prescient Black lady who left a review on Amazon, you need to let it warm up a little in your hands before applying it to your face. She was 100% correct – when I tried this method, I saw zero white cast every day. You can rub your fingers together to generate heat or just wait for a few moments for your body heat to do the job. It makes a big difference in ease of application, as it turns clear in half the time. \n\nThis sunscreen quickly became my daily driver through the coldest part of winter, when the air was dry and my skin was even drier. It soothes my eczema patches, keeps my skin moisturized, and doesn't cause a single bit of irritation. If you have normal to oily skin, you may describe this stuff as \"greasy,\" but that wasn't my experience. Unlike the BGS Kids sunscreen, the greasiness quickly went away, leaving a neutral finish that looks and feels like bare skin. I don't know what kind of witchcraft they're doing over at Pipette but I am a HUGE FAN. It's also an incredible value, because you get 3 oz for under $20 and it's available in several retail stores in the U.S. What's not to love?\n\nAccording to [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/lnepqq/misc_compared_the_biossance_pipette_mineral/) comparing the Biossance Squalane + Zinc SPF 30 and Pipette mineral SPF 50 sunscreens, the two products have a significant amount of overlap in their ingredients lists. The two brands actually have the same parent company – Amyris. That means that they could potentially use the same base formula. They share a squalane focus in their product compositions and have similar marketing, using \"clean\" and \"nontoxic\" type buzzwords. Now for the million-dollar question: Is this a dupe for either of the Biossance sunscreens? I have no idea; I've never tried Biossance sunscreens because they're too pricey. /u/Sunscreen-Queen shared her thoughts on the Biossance sunscreens in [her mega-review post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/lcu9os/review_25_facial_sunscreen_reviews_biossance/). She ranked it the \"best everyday sunscreen\" and answered several questions about it in the comments section.\n\n[Dr. Dray made a video reviewing the Pipette sunscreen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPrMA1UJAtM&ab_channel=DrDray) She experienced a \"barely noticeable\" white cast on her pale skin. Other than that, she was complimentary and mostly had good things to say about Pipette products. I didn't personally see a cast on her skin in the video, but I know cameras can be deceiving. \n\nDr. Alexis Stephens also reviewed the Pipette sunscreen in her [Best Sunscreens for Darker Skin video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prNn0rMT2cE&ab_channel=DrAlexisStephens). She called it a \"total dupe for the Biossance sunscreen.\" In the video, she does a split-screen test of both products so you can see how they perform side-by-side. She experienced no white cast after letting it absorb for 10 minutes. \n\nI also want to share [this review by @brownskinderm on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKHAx1ZhRpO/), which offers another POC perspective. She ranks the product texture and white cast a \"C,\" but gives extra credit for its moisturizing and antioxidant ingredients. Pipette earned a \"C+\" grade for adults, and \"A\" grade for babies.

        "body": "#MORE REVIEWS -- Part Two\n\n**(9) Avène Solar Cream / Very High Protection Cream Skin SPF50 + Without Perfume**\n\n**Filters**: Tinosorb M, Tinosorb S, Uvasorb HEB, Avobenzone\n\n**Key Facts**: Fragrance Free, Alcohol Free, Essential Oil Free\n\n**Marketing Claims**: This is also known as \"Solaire Cream\" depending on the website. The product description says this is \"ideal for sun-sensitive and hypersensitive skins, light and milky skins (blond, red-hair skin).\" I'm assuming this is their way of saying they made this for Fitzpatrick Types I and II. (It me!) With Tinosorb M and Tinosorb S (UVA/UVB filters), Avobenzone (UVA), and Uvasorb HEB (UVB), this product offers stellar broad-spectrum protection.\n\n**Impressions**: The directions say to apply SIX PUMPS to your face and neck – many people would assume that one pump = one dose, so it's great that the instructions are so clear. I used exactly that much. It's very thick cream and difficult to spread, but I made it work by dotting little blobs all over my face and working them in from there. Upon first application, it caused a purple-white cast, noticeable but not nearly as bad as Avène mineral milk (spoiler). In the time it took me to finish applying, put on my shoes, find a tennis ball for the dog, and walk outside, the white cast had already faded. That was a very good start! \n\nIt's not really that moisturizing, so you couldn't use this as the only moisturizer in your AM routine. It lacks our friends glycerin, hyaluronic acid, squalane, etc. In terms of appearance, you can see by the selfies that it looks just like bare skin. It left a barely noticeable film on top of my skin, which I believe is a sign that it formed a good, solid barrier. \n\nTwo hours after the initial application, the white cast returned like a Bond villain attacking the hero for the final confrontation. It appeared as white, flaky dandruff-like flecks on the driest parts of my face (lower cheeks). I don't shave my face so there's some fine blond hair in that general area. I didn't rest my face in my hands or rub my face at all, so these white flecks appeared out of nowhere. It seems like it was exacerbating my existing dry spots, despite my super-moisturizing AM routine. It's a bummer because I was really enjoying this stuff before I looked in the mirror and saw how dry I was. \n\nThere is a similar product available in this product line, the Avène Solar Fluid, which is better for oily and combination skin. It's formulated to be mattifying with a non-shiny effect. If you don't have particularly dry skin and want something to mitigate oilness, you should give the fluid a try rather than the cream. In the distance, you hear a ghost wailing, *If you've tried it... give us a revieeewwwwww...*\n\n[Several reviews on MakeupAlley](https://www.makeupalley.com/product/showreview.asp/ItemId=118618/Very-High-Protection-Cream-SPF-50+/Avene/Sunscreen) corroborate my experience. Reviewers who described their skin as \"dry\" complained that the sunscreen clings to flakes, sticky feeling, and goopy texture. One person said it left them \"as pink as Peppa Pig.\"\n\n**Ingredients**: [INCI Decoder](https://incidecoder.com/products/avene-avene-suncare-cream-spf-50)\n\n**Price**: CREAM is $12.79 for 50 ml ($0.25 per ml) and FLUID is $15.72 for 50 ml ($0.31 per ml)\n\n**Photos**: [Click here](https://imgur.com/a/E3a30xc)\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n**(10) Uriage Bariésun Ultra-Light Fluid SPF50+**\n\n**Filters**: Octocrylene, Octinoxate, Avobenzone, Octisalate, Tinosorb S\n\n**Key Facts**: Fragrance Free, Alcohol Free, Essential Oil Free, Water Resistant\n\n**Marketing Claims**: This sunscreen boasts a \"latest-generation filter complex\" that provides comprehensive UVA/UVB protection. It contains vitamins C and E. Looking at the ingredients list, this one actually is the **shortest** (24 ingredients), which means it's straightforward but also that it lacks unique or fun ingredients like centella, hyaluronic acid, and apologies from your high school boyfriend for how he treated you. Fewer ingredients usually translates to safer for sensitive skin. \n\nThe product page says that \"95% people who tested the product observed an invisible finish after application and 86% observed a non-oily finish\" (according to a usage test with 20 people, but it doesn't say if any of them were POC).\n\n**Impressions**: The texture and feel of the sunscreen is nearly identical to our beloved Skin Aqua Super Moisture Milk. It comes out as a runny liquid and is most easily applied directly to your face, rather than to your fingers first. For all that this is an all-chemical sunscreen, it certainly performs like a combination one that has titanium oxide. Tinosorb S is the likely culprit. It's easy to rub in, but leaves a noticeable whitecast for the first minute before drying down clear. I actually quite like this because it's easy to see where I've already applied the stuff, and to tell which areas need a bit more. The bottle must be shaken before you squeeze any out (it separates easily) but it lacks the satisfying clickity-clackity sound the blue (previously gold) Skin Aqua super moisture milk bottle makes. \n\nMy first impression was lovely – it felt nice and moisturizing, and wasn't too shiny or greasy. However, after wearing it for a few hours I started to feel drier and slightly tight. My skin became matte. This is a negative for me but a potential positive for my combo and oily readers. The second time I wore this sunscreen, I accidentally squirted it directly in my eyeball and it hurt like a bitch. So, don't do that, I guess. Also, there was absolutely no pilling at all, even when I rubbed my fingers vigorously on my jawline. That's a plus for makeup-wearers! I think I could come to love using this, if only the price were better. It'll be a good product for traveling. \n\nThe bottle is SO SMALL that it's actually quite pricey when you calculate the price by volume. (Same size as the Bioderma Cicabio, for those keeping score at home.) Look at it next to the U.S. sunscreens in my group photo – it looks like a deluxe sample, not a whole-ass product! I would forgive this if brands offered a \"jumbo\" size, even better if it comes with a discount in price per ml. Who do we have to lobby in order to make that an industry standard?\n\nI also ordered a bottle of Uriage Bariésun 100 Extreme Protective Fluid, which has better filters, with Tinosorb M, Octocrylene, Octisalate, Uvinul T 150, Avobenzone, and Tinosorb S. The bottle is also slightly larger and the price per ml is about half the Ultra-Light Fluid so it's a more cost-effective purchase. \n\nHowever, Cosmetis has consistently failed me on shipping delivery times. My first box took 10 weeks to arrive and the second box was delivered to the wrong town. I'm still waiting on that one to get here. I was going to wait on posting this until I received it, but that would be sometime in May! I don't want to wait that long and I know everyone is eagerly researching sunscreens with summer around the corner, so I decided to nix it for now. If you've tried this or any other sunscreen in the Uriage Bariésun line, tell us about it! Give us a review in the comments. \n\nYou can read reviews of the Uriage Bariésun Lotion for Kids SPF 50+ and Uriage Bariésun Mat Fluid SPF 50+ in [this review post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/lk0zos/sun_care_recent_european_american_sunscreens/) by /u/balt-amour. \n**Ingredients**: [INCI Decoder](https://incidecoder.com/products/uriage-bariesun-ultra-light-fluid-spf50)\n\n**Price**: $16.18 for 30 ml ($0.53 per ml)\n\n**Photos**: [Click here](https://imgur.com/a/ktBUsdf)\n\n#More reviews in comment below.

        "body": "#MORE REVIEWS -- Part Three\n\n**(11) Black Girl Sunscreen (BGS) Kids SPF 50**\n\n**Filters**: Avobenzone 3%, Homosalate 15%, Octisalate 5% \n\n**Key Facts**: Vegan, Cruelty Free, Fragrance Free, Alcohol Free, Essential Oil Free, Paraben Free, Reef Safe\n\n**Marketing Claims**: The primary selling point and hallmark of this brand is the lack of white cast, which makes it suitable for POC. I can't personally vouch for its performance on that front (23andme says that I'm 99.8% white person) but there are many other reviews that back up this claim. The sunscreen is packed with moisturizing ingredients to minimize irritation, including chamomile, shea butter, jojoba oil, carrot seed oil, avocado, aloe, and sunflower seed oil. I'm not really one to go for products with a lot of botanicals, but these ingredients all carry the \"goodie\" rating on INCI Decoder and I haven't reacted to any of these in the past, as far as I know. \n\nIn particular, the evidence for shea butter is mixed. It has [anti-inflammatory properties](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22499721/) and [anti-fungal properties](http://jddtonline.info/index.php/jddt/article/view/1314) but the American Academy of Dermatology Association warns that it can [clog pores and cause acne in skin of color](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/acne/DIY/skin-color). Despite the benefits these ingredients offer, I feel like it's probably safest to avoid heavy oils like shea butter, cocoa butter, and coconut oil if you are acne-prone.\n\nI also want to write something about Avobenzone, the only UVA blocker in this formulation. It has been shown to degrade significantly in light, with ~36% reduction in avobenzone's UV absorbance following one hour of exposure to sunlight. This degradation can be reduced by using a photostabilizer, like Octocrylene, Octisalate, Tinosorb S, or Tinosorb M. (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avobenzone)) I'm not a chemist and I'm not an expert in SPF formulation, but I wonder if Avobenzone is enough to give this product adequate UVA protection? It's an American product, so the market puts very little emphasis on UVA blocking and the brand probably didn't feel any pressure to optimize that aspect of the formula. I wish the US FDA had adopted PA/PPD ratings so we would have a sense of the UVA protection.\n\nThe BASF sunscreen simulator isn't available right now, but the calculator on MakingCosmetics spits out a possible SPF of 24 for the BGS Kids. Please take that number with a whole heaping handful of salt, because there are a bunch of other variables and ingredients that go into sunscreen formulation that can change it. Either way, I'm kinda sus and I don't trust this stuff to give me good enough protection. I wish BGS shared independent testing results or a PPD/PA number. That would help to put my mind at ease. Even though I love skincare drama, I would hate for BGS to go through a Purito-style reckoning... knock on wood.\n\n**Impressions**: After reading [this fabulous review](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/l3e3sw/review_my_review_of_black_girl_sunscreen_kids/) by /u/teddivan96, I decided to buy some of this magic stuff. I was a little wary about the UVA protection, but moved forward with the purchase anyway because it's cheap! I'm also susceptible to hype and the brand founder seems nice on Instagram. \n\nThis all-chemical sunscreen performed identically to the Pipette all-zinc sunscreen (see review below) upon first application. It's thick and pasty white at first, but rubs in clear with a little elbow grease. It has a slight sunscreen-ish scent to it but it didn't really bother me. Unlike the Pipette sunscreen, it irritated my eyes and eyelids, which began to burn immediately. I would call this a cream-to-oil texture. After applying it, it became VERY greasy and sticky; my hair kept sticking to my face and my fingers came away oily when I touched my face. It legitimately felt like I was in the middle of oil cleansing. The texture was like DHC cleansing oil, which is largely olive oil. I looked like Severus Snape after visiting the Hogwarts sauna room. BGS has a matte sunscreen with SPF 45 that probably solves this problem. If you're worried about feeling greasy, you should try that one instead. \n\nAs I wore this, I felt prickly irritation on my cheeks like a thousand mosquito bites. I ended up washing it off after a few hours, before the sun even set that day. You can see in the photos that my face was flared up with painful red splotches. The next morning, I woke up to three (3) new red bumps on my face, two of them in areas where I never break out. I haven't had any acne in more than six months, but BGS Kids broke me out after four hours of wear. If this is what the *kids* version is like, I will never try any of this brand's other products; I imagine they're a breakout in a bottle. Overall, BGS is a hard nope and a huge disappointment. \n\nI want to reiterate that I am not the brand's target customer and they probably don't care that some random white girl didn't like their product. This sunscreen wasn't made for me, and I'm okay with that.\n\n**Ingredients**: [INCI Decoder](https://incidecoder.com/products/black-girl-sunscreen-bgs-kids-spf-50)\n\n**Price**: $9.99 for 89 ml ($0.11 per ml)\n\n**Photos**: [Click here](https://imgur.com/a/1PtbzU3)\n\n#More reviews in comment below.

        "body": "#MORE REVIEWS -- Part Four\n\n**(12) Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer with Sunscreen SPF 50+**\n\n**Filters**: Octinoxate 7.5%, Octisalate 5%, Octocrylene 7%, Oxybenzone 6%, Titanium Dioxide (Micronized) 5.7%\n\n**Key Facts**: Fragrance Free, Alcohol Free, Essential Oil Free\n\n**Marketing Claims**: Cetaphil is our favorite boring brand. The product page says it is \"clinically tested hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic, so it won't irritate skin or clog pores\" and \"clinically proven to be gentle on sensitive skin.\" It also says that it's \"non greasy\" and \"absorbs quickly and leaves no filmy, white residue.\"\n\nThe formulation is no-frills. There aren't any fun or interesting ingredients to showcase. Even the Vanicream SPF 50 (which may have been discontinued? angels weep) has some squalane in it for moisturizing purposes, while Cetaphil stuck with glycerin. It seems like a basic-ass moisturizer with some sunscreen filters thrown in so they could market another product and take up more shelf space at your local drugstore. \n\nOxybenzone (Benzophenone-3) is controversial and may have safety issues. Its molecules are small and lipophilic (oil loving), which results in very good absorption. The problem is that you want sunscreens on the top of your skin and not in your bloodstream. Oxybenzone absorbs so well that it can be detected in urine just four hours after application. (Source: [INCI Decoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/benzophenone-3)) This [article by JAMA Dermatology](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/1105240) says \"in a human study, oxybenzone did not demonstrate significant endocrine disruption, even with a formulation containing 10% oxybenzone. In fact, after 40 years of use, we are not aware of any published study that demonstrates acute toxic effects in humans with systemic absorption of oxybenzone.\" This is the only sunscreen in this review that contains Oxybenzone.\n\nSince this is also a US sunscreen, it's useful to compare it against the BGS Kids sunscreen. This is a combination SPF with five filters, while the BGS one is a chemical SPF with three filters. The MakingCosmetics calculator claims the Cetaphil is SPF 63! This is an extremely preliminary and incomplete figure, but it sounds like good news on that front.\n\nCetaphil's parent company is Galderma Laboratories, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nestlé.\n\n**Impressions**: I originally intended to buy one of Cetaphil's EU sunscreens (UVA/UVB Defense SPF50 Daytime Moisturizer), which has Tinosorb S, Avobenzone, Titanium Dioxide, Octocrylene, Mexoryl SX, Mexoryl XL, and Uvinul T 150. However, I ended up choosing a candidate from their US line instead, because it's cheaper and more accessible. If the EU version is anything like the US one, I'll have to try it out sooner or later.\n\nThe texture feels similar to Olay Complete SPF 15 and SPF 30, which I used as my sole moisturizer throughout high school and college. It's worth noting that the [Olay Complete formulation](https://incidecoder.com/products/olay-complete-daily-defense-all-day-moisturizer-with-sunscreen-spf-30-for-sensitive-skin) includes aloe, squalane, niacinamide, panthenol, zinc, and green tea so it's a far better and more, dare I say, *complete* moisturizer. If only it came in an SPF 50+ version!! I would use that until I die. Olay executives, if you're reading this, hit me up!\n\nThis is one of the only products I tried where my skin felt exactly the same before and after applying it. I used six pumps for one application. It's a white cream that rubs in clear right away, so I had no trouble applying liberal amounts all over my face, eyes, neck, shoulders, and chest. I even smeared some on my pink t-shirt accidentally but it didn't leave any stain. This sunscreen is inoffensive, absorbs quickly with zero stickiness, provides a decent amount of moisture, and doesn't cause trouble. It's neither greasy nor drying. I saw no redness, felt no irritation, and didn't experience any annoying side effects like pilling or white cast. This is the sunscreen equivalent of a kindergartener bringing a No. 2 pencil to show and tell. \n\nFor all that the filters in this product are potentially (probably) less effective than the EU version, it's a pretty damn good option for very sensitive skin. There's not much to write about, and I kind of love that. Very on-brand for Cetaphil. If you're in the US and not able to purchase Asian, EU, or Australian products, this is a very good, accessible option for you.\n\nCetaphil must have gotten wise to the outrageous profit margins that EU, Japanese, and Korean brands were generating with their tiny bottle sizes. This one is only 50 ml and looks silly next to standard American size bottles (3 oz+). I'm sure that's why they decided to package it in a big box to fool less-savvy customers. I got a pack of two bottles for a little over $30, so overall the price is not bad. I think I might just hate tiny bottles of sunscreen.\n\nI'm not going to share other reviews because I found that aggregate websites grouped this US product with the UK version, which I don't think is the same formulation. I wasn't able to tell which version the reviewer was using (other than telltale US-UK spelling differences) so I had to wash my hands of it. \n\n**Ingredients**: [INCI Decoder](https://incidecoder.com/products/cetaphil-cetaphil-daily-facial-moisturizer-broad-spectrum-spf50-fragrance-free)\n\n**Price**: $16.79 for 50 ml ($0.33 per ml)\n\n**Photos**: [Click here](https://imgur.com/a/VW5APxj)\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n**(13) Coppertone Pure & Simple Baby SPF 50**\n\n**Filters**: Zinc Oxide (24.08%)\n\n**Key Facts**: Fragrance Free, Dye Free, Alcohol Free, Essential Oil Free, Paraben Free, Sulfate Free, Waterproof (80 Minutes)\n\n**Marketing Claims**: Here it is, the classic all-American zinc sunscreen, at a very high 24% concentration. This is another baby sunscreen (you know how I love \"baby\" branded stuff) to compare with the other mineral sunscreens listed below. The marketing describes it as \"tear free,\" meaning that it shouldn't irritate eyes. The Coppertone website says that it's the \"most gentle and hypoallergenic sunscreen\" in their extensive product portfolio. \n\nIt has a bunch of \"100% natural\" botanicals with calming and soothing properties (tea leaf, sea kelp, and lotus extracts). Zinc itself also has soothing properties, particularly for inflammatory acne, rosacea, and eczema. [Read more about zinc therapy in dermatology in this study.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4120804/) For anyone allergic to honey/bees, this contains beeswax (cera alba). It also has a bunch of silicones, but very few moisturizing ingredients.\n\nIt is both interesting and hilarious that all three sunscreens in the Pure & Simple line are (as far as I can tell) identical, although they use different branding for adult, kids, and baby versions. [See this thread with a direct comparison of ingredients lists.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/grzc84/product_question_these_3_coppertone_pure_and/) As /u/DarrenFromFinance points out, \"this is called brand extension and it's very common. If you have three apparently different products, you can take up three times as much shelf space for visual impact and sell a lot more product — a shopper might buy the adult-branded bottle for herself and then the children's version for the kids, not knowing that they're the same product.\" \n\n**Impressions**: I inadvertently packed this in my bag (read: I stole it) after a beach trip with the family, so this was definitely purchased for an actual child and not for an obsessive adult. One of my best beach towels didn't come home with me, so I consider that a fair trade. \n\nIn terms of texture, it's a very runny liquid that comes out of the bottle quickly, so it's difficult to moderate how much you squeeze out. I shook the living hell out of the bottle to make sure it hadn't separated before I opened it up to try it out. It's impossible to measure using the finger method because it drips everywhere, so I'm pretty sure I used a little more than a standard application for my face and neck. I found it difficult to blend by either rubbing or patting. \"Pasty\" is the best word I can use to describe how I looked, with white cast equivalent to the Isntree Perfect Sun Block but with none of the cosmetic elegance. I couldn't find lighting that made my skin look like skin and not grey play-doh. I felt sticky and uncomfortable, and progressively drier over time. This is not moisturizing and seemed to suck the hydration out of my cheeks. I always lather up in the morning with serums and my BFF Vanicream, but that wasn't enough to maintain hydration while wearing this Coppertone sunscreen.\n\nThe marketing claims this is waterproof but I don't agree at all. I wore this on a humid, rainy day (hello spring!) and I couldn't get it to stay put on my face. It never really dried down; anything that brushed against my face for the briefest moment came back tacky and white, even 20 minutes after initial application. I had to tuck paper towels into my black hoodie so it wouldn't rub off onto the fabric. If I tried to swim or work out while wearing this, I'm sure it would wash off right away. Thank goodness the UV index was low (2) that day! Further, it came off with no trouble with cleanser and water, so I think the \"waterproof\" claim is dubious at best. On a positive note, it didn't irritate my eyes even a tiny bit, even when I smeared some on my waterline. It is indeed \"tear free,\" even for my dry eyes.\n\n**Ingredients**: [INCI Decoder](https://incidecoder.com/products/coppertone-pure-simple-baby-tear-free-spf-50)\n\n**Price**: $8.97 for 177 ml ($0.05 per ml)\n\n**Photos**: [Click here](https://imgur.com/a/9FIK082)\n\n#More reviews in comment below.

Based on your reviews, I’m going with the Cetaphil daily facial moisturizer as Cetaphil has always played really well with my sensitive skin at a decent price point! Thanks again this is life-saving research!",

    "body": "**Introduction**\r  \nOn March 3, 1876, Mary Crouch, the wife of farmer Allen Crouch, was minding her own business, making soap in her garden in Olympia Springs, Kentucky when something very peculiar happened.\r  \n\r  \nAs she stood in front of her house, seemingly out of nowhere, flecks of meat began falling around her. Sources do not specify how long the meat rained down, but by all accounts, it was a relatively quick event.\r  \n\r  \nRegardless, a significant amount of meat fell on the Crouch farm that day, what Mrs. Crouch would later describe as a “horse wagon full” of meat, a measurement that seems obscure to modern audiences but would have been instantly recognizable in the late 19th century.\r  \n\r  \nThese hunks of meat were approximately 2 inches by 2 inches and covered an area of approximately 50 by 100 yards. The largest, though, were nearly double the size, measuring in at about 4 inches by 4 inches. However, these were not nice, neat cuts of meat. They were fragments, that appeared to be torn and ripped rather than sliced.\r  \n\r  \nTheir origin was a mystery. Mrs. Crouch stated that the skies above her were clear, as the mystery meat rained down around her. She and her husband both saw the meat rain as a sign from God, though it’s not readily evident what they viewed it as a sign of.\r  \n\r  \nOver the days, months, and years that followed the anomalous weather event, many, including locals, journalists, and scientists, would try to discern what exactly had caused the Kentucky Meat Shower of 1876. While there are compelling theories as to the shower’s origins, the truth has remained elusive, over a century and a half later.\r  \n\r  \n**Locals Ponder the Shower**\r  \nImmediately after the Kentucky Meat Shower, locals became fascinated by the phenomenon. Mary Crouch stated that the meat had been fresh and fleshy when it had initially fallen but after laying out in the open overnight, it had become dry and crusty.\r  \n\r  \nA local hunter wandered through the area and examined the meat, declaring his opinion that it was bear meat.\r  \n\r  \nTwo particularly brave (or foolish) neighbors went so far as to taste the meat. They said that the flavor resembled that of venison or mutton.\r  \n\r  \nOthers decried the Kentucky Meat Shower as a hoax, though how or why the Crouches would cover their yard with shredded meat chunks beggars the imagination.\r  \n\r  \nApparently, the Crouches’ cat had quite a feast on the fallen meat as well.\r  \n\r  \nOver the next few days, neighbors, journalists, and scientists flocked to the Crouch farm to try to discover the cause of the Kentucky Meat Shower. Within a week, the story of the shower appeared in notable newspapers across the country, including the New York Times and the New York Herald.\r  \n\r  \nNobody seemed to have a firm idea of what had caused the shower, but that certainly didn’t stop people from speculating.\r  \n\r  \n**Theories on the Kentucky Meat Shower**\r  \nOne of the most fanciful explanations for the Kentucky Meat Shower was that it had been an actual meat-eor shower (sorry…). This relied on the theory at the time that meteors and meteorites came from exploded planets.\r  \n\r  \nThis theory supposed that the meat in the Kentucky Meat Shower was actually the meat of animals from another planet that had clumped together upon that planet’s explosion. Then, when the meat-eor entered the Earth’s atmosphere, it broke apart, resulting in the shower of meat chunks upon the Crouch farm.\r  \n\r  \nBeyond being an incredibly silly theory to begin with, we now know that any such meat would have quickly burned up upon entering the Earth’s atmosphere and would have never made it to the surface.\r  \n\r  \nAnother wild theory suggested that perhaps two men had gotten into a particularly brutal knife fight and that a tornado had sucked up their remains, then rained them down over the Crouch farm.\r  \n\r  \nThree months after the shower, a scientist named Leopold Brandeis analyzed some hunks of meat from the shower that had been preserved in glycerin.\r  \n\r  \nHis conclusion was that the “meat” was, in fact, not meat at all. Rather, Brandeis suggested, the strange material that had fallen over the Crouch farm was nostoc, a form of cyanobacteria that clumps together and is surrounded by a gelatinous envelope.\r  \n\r  \nWhen it rains, these clumps tend to swell. Brandeis claimed they tend to appear flesh-colored, though the reality seems to be that they are more greenish in hue.\r  \n\r  \nBeyond coloration, however, there was another key issue with Brandeis’ theory: on the day of the Kentucky Meat Shower, Mrs. Crouch had asserted that the skies were totally clear. While I think it’s possible that she missed other details (as we’ll discuss later), I feel like she would have noticed if liquid rain had accompanied the strange meat rain, particularly in the lead-up to the meat shower, which would have been necessary for nostoc to form.\r  \n\r  \nFortunately, Brandeis did not keep the samples to himself. He sent them to Dr. A Mead Edwards, the president of the Newark Science Association who analyzed the sample and determined that it was indeed meat. He speculated that it was lung tissue from either a horse or a human infant, which are apparently strikingly similar in composition.\r  \n\r  \nAnother scientist Dr. J.W.S. Arnold analyzed the specimens and concurred with Edwards, writing in The American Journal of Microscopy and Popular Science that the meat specimens appeared to contain animal lung tissue, muscle, and cartilage, an odd variety.\r  \n\r  \nTheir findings, however, did not bring them any closer to discovering why this strange combination of viscera had fallen on the Crouch farm. However, this combination of factors, namely the seeming variety of animal meats present, the different types of meat present (lung tissue, muscle, cartilage, etc.), and the fact that the pieces were shredded, pointed to perhaps the best possible solution we have…\r  \n\r  \n**Vulture Vomit!**\r  \nScientists at the time suggested that the Kentucky Meat Shower might have been the result of vulture vomit. Modern-day scientists tend to concur that this seems to be the most likely scenario, though it’s certainly not without its own issues.\r  \n\r  \nKentucky is home to black vultures and turkey vultures, both of which are rather habitual vomiters. Vultures will vomit as a defense mechanism when startled, and will also do so if they find themselves too heavy to fly.\r  \n\r  \nFurthermore, vultures seem to treat vomiting much like we humans do yawning. Ever been in a meeting where one person yawns, leading to another person yawning, and before you know it, everyone in the meeting is yawning, seemingly in unison? When one vulture begins to vomit, other vultures in its kettle (a legitimate name for a group of vultures) tend to do so as well, which could have produced the impression of a meat shower.\r  \n\r  \nFurthermore, witnesses to the aftereffects of the meat shower noted just how rank the meat was. It’s easy to assume that this was simply the result of the meat sitting out in the open for some time. However, this process could have been exacerbated if the meat was already decaying when it rained down.\r  \n\r  \nKeep in mind that vultures are scavengers and tend to feed on dead and decaying animal material. They also aren’t the most discerning customers. They don’t look for choice cuts of meat, which would explain the variety of meat types found at the scene, including cartilage and lung tissue. They also aren’t particularly picky about what kind of animals they’ll feed on, which explains why there were so many different conclusions regarding the type(s) of animal meat present in the shower.\r  \n\r  \nThe biggest point against this theory is that Mrs. Crouch states that she looked up in the sky as the meat rained down around her and noted that it was completely clear. One would think that she would have seen a kettle of vultures flying above if this were the case.\r  \n\r  \nI think, however, that it would be far easier to miss this than, say, ordinary water-based rainfall, particularly since she would have been distracted by the mystery meat falling all around her.\r  \n\r  \nAdditionally, if the vultures had indeed purged their stomachs to lighten their load, they might have gotten a slight speed boost and escaped Mrs. Crouch’s vision by the time she thought to look up.\r  \n\r  \nVultures can also soar quite high. While migrating, they often fly around 5,000 feet, though they have been observed as high as 30,000 feet or more, which would certainly make them difficult to spot from ground level, particularly for someone just a little bit distracted by an ongoing shower of meat.\r  \n\r  \nI certainly don’t think there’s enough evidence, nor will there likely ever be, to assert that this is what happened with any sense of finality; however, I think it’s definitely the explanation that makes the most sense. Certainly makes the two neighbors who tasted it all that much more disgusting, doesn’t it?\r  \n\r  \n**Conclusion**\r  \nIn 2004, Kurt Gohde, a professor of art at Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky, made an odd discovery when looking through a storage closet at the college. The find was a small glass bottle; its label had been mostly scratched off, but the location of Olympia Springs was still plainly visible.\r  \n\r  \nInside the bottle, sitting in a bit of yellowish-brown liquid was a hunk of whitish meat. As you might have guessed, this hunk was a preserved specimen from the Kentucky Meat Shower of 1876 (you can see it for yourself in the Atlas Obscura article and the Ripley’s article listed below).\r  \n\r  \nGohde initially hoped that he could have the sample analyzed and could, once and for all, settle the debate over precisely what kind of meat this was. Unfortunately, the sample was too old and contaminated to pull accurate results.\r  \n\r  \nGohde, however, was undeterred. He sent the sample to a taste lab in Cincinnati, had them analyze the flavor profile of the meat, and then made said flavor profile into… jelly beans.\r  \n\r  \nThen, at the 2007 Court Days, a huge outdoor event for buying, selling, and trading goods, held each year in Mount Sterling, Kentucky since 1794, Gohde distributed the jelly beans to a skeptical public.\r  \n\r  \nThose brave enough to try the jelly beans said they tasted like “raw bacon” and “strawberry pork chop.” Gohde himself said that the jelly bean tasted like “a heavily sugared bacon with a metal aftertaste.”\r  \n\r  \nGohde was hoping that a meat connoisseur at Court Days might taste the jelly beans and be able to pinpoint the distinct flavor. It would appear he had no such luck.\r  \n\r  \nI can’t exactly say I’m surprised… if the sample had become too old and contaminated for laboratory analysis, I can’t imagine a flavor profile taken from it would be particularly accurate.\r  \n\r  \nNonetheless, I have to commend Gohde for such a unique approach to an unsolved meteorological mystery. I have a feeling though that, much like the flavor of those jelly beans, the true cause of the Kentucky Meat Shower of 1876 will remain forever shrouded in mystery.\r  \n\r  \n**Sources**\r  \n[https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/kentucky-meat-shower](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/kentucky-meat-shower)\r  \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky\\_meat\\_shower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_meat_shower)\r  \n[https://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2014/New%20York%20NY%20Herald/New%20York%20NY%20Herald%201876/New%20York%20NY%20Herald%201876%20-%200875.pdf](https://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2014/New%20York%20NY%20Herald/New%20York%20NY%20Herald%201876/New%20York%20NY%20Herald%201876%20-%200875.pdf)\r  \n[https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/running-ponies/the-great-kentucky-meat-shower-mystery-unwound-by-projectile-vulture-vomit/](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/running-ponies/the-great-kentucky-meat-shower-mystery-unwound-by-projectile-vulture-vomit/)\r  \n[https://wonderopolis.org/wonder/What-Was-the-Kentucky-Meat-Shower](https://wonderopolis.org/wonder/What-Was-the-Kentucky-Meat-Shower)\r  \n[https://www.ripleys.com/weird-news/the-kentucky-meat-shower-of-1876/](https://www.ripleys.com/weird-news/the-kentucky-meat-shower-of-1876/)\r  \n[https://www.popsci.com/story/science/weirdest-thing-meat-shower-kodak-cow-sword-swallower/](https://www.popsci.com/story/science/weirdest-thing-meat-shower-kodak-cow-sword-swallower/)\r  \n[https://www.vice.com/en/article/kzkmgw/the-mystery-of-the-kentucky-meat-shower](https://www.vice.com/en/article/kzkmgw/the-mystery-of-the-kentucky-meat-shower)\r  \n[https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/history/2019/10/25/kentucky-meat-shower-meat-fell-sky-bath-county-olympian-springs/4082953002/](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/history/2019/10/25/kentucky-meat-shower-meat-fell-sky-bath-county-olympian-springs/4082953002/)\r  \n[https://www.nytimes.com/1876/03/10/archives/flesh-descending-in-a-shower-an-astounding-phenomenon-in.html?searchResultPosition=1](https://www.nytimes.com/1876/03/10/archives/flesh-descending-in-a-shower-an-astounding-phenomenon-in.html?searchResultPosition=1)\r  \n",

Has \"great skin moisturising properties\" according to [Incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dipropylene-glycol). Safety rating of 1-2 (very safe) on [Cosdna](https://www.cosdna.com/eng/b05d771602.html). This is likely nothing to worry about unless you already know you have a sensitivity, as it is mostly there to keep the formula feeling elegant and seems to be mildly hydrating. \n\n//\n\nHYALURONIC ACID FERMENT FILTRATE \n\nNew kind of hyaluronic acid that Hada Labo claims will \"help fortify the skins moisture barrier to help skin looking plump and supple\". This is the most controversial addition as many people are sensitive to ferments and this product will unfortunately now be unsuitable for them, which is a real shame. However, if you are someone who enjoys ferments, this might sound rather exciting. I couldn't find much info when I searched \"fermented hyaluronic acid\", but Ratzilla's list seems to suggest that the HA has been fermented with Lactococcus bacteria, which is proposed to \"positively influence both the speed and quality of epidermal growth, resulting in better barrier function and overall skin quality\" ([Incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/lactococcus-ferment-lysate)). I'm not convinced a difference in effect will be extremely noticeable alongside the 6 other kinds of HA but I expect it will work well for plumping and improving the health and appearance of the skin regardless. \n\n//\n\nHYDROLIZED SODIUM HYALURONATE \n\nThis is a super, super tiny (low molecular weight) version of hyaluronic acid, which is intended to penetrate even deeper into the skin and moisturise deeper than standard HA. If your skin wasn't bothered by the Hydrolized hyaluronic acid (another smaller molecule form) in the original formula (still in this one too!) then you might well not be bothered by this version too. Source: [incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-sodium-hyaluronate)\n\n//\n\nPROPANEDIOL \n\nCommonly used solvent, humectant and emollient. In short, makes formulas more cosmetically elegant and also helps to pull moisture into the skin and keep it there. Considered very safe and a non-irritant. Further reading: [byrdie article](https://www.byrdie.com/propanediol-for-skin-4773491) [paula's choice ](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/uncategorized/propanediol.html)\n\n//\n\nCAPRYLHYDROXAMIC ACID \n\nAn anti-fungal amino acid derived from coconut oil that acts as a preservative. Limited data regarding safety, but Honest Beauty claims it is safer and less harsh than other commonly used preservatives (take this with a grain of salt as Honest Beauty has an agenda to push and so will be biased). Sources: [truth in ageing ](https://www.truthinaging.com/ingredients/caprylhydroxamic-acid)\n[honest beauty ](https://www.honest.com/blog/wellness/ingredients/what-is-caprylhydroxamic-acid/13775.html)\n\n//\n\nHYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE \n\nUsed as a thickener in cosmetics, gives a nice slippy, gel-like feeling. Water soluble, regarded as safe. \n\n//\n\nXANTHAN GUM \n\nExtremely commonly used thickener and stabiliser. Unlikely to be an issue unless you have a specific sensitivity to it. \n\n\n//\n\nAnd now, let's look at the changes in the top few ingredients: \n\n• The top ingredients, which I usually regard as the most important, have changed in that normal Glycerin has been removed and replaced with Diglycerin, and it's now the 7th ingredient as opposed to the 3rd. Diglycerin is not much different as both are powerful hydrators, but Diglycerin supposedly \"penetrates slower into the skin but gives longer lasting moisture and less sticky, better skin-feel.\" Source: [incidecoder ](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/diglycerin) This might be good for people who have tried the original Premium and found it to be too sticky on the skin! However, due to it being moved lower down, the impact might not be too obvious here. \n\n• Pentylene Glycol has been bumped way up the list from 16th to 4th! This is another thickening ingredient that is key to the sensory feeling of the product, and according to incidecoder its also a moisturiser and helps to hydrate and smooth the skin. However, [the derm review ](https://thedermreview.com/pentylene-glycol/) actually claims it doesn't have any specific skin benefits, but is at least safe and non-irritating. I personally would rather have kept a higher concentration of glycerin or diglycerin in the product as opposed to this as I think they're more intensely moisturising/hydrating to the skin. \n\n• On the other hand, urea has been moved from the 5th ingredient to the 3rd, where glycerin was previously. From [incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethyl-urea): \"A derivative of Urea, that works as a strong moisturizer and humectant meaning that it helps the skin to cling onto water and thus to make it hydrated and elastic.\n\nAccording to manufacturer's data,  Hydroxyethyl Urea has a similar moisturizing ability to glycerin (measured at 5%), but it feels nicer on the skin as it is non-sticky and non-tacky and gives a lubricous and moist feeling to the skin.\" \n\nSo, perhaps this formulation could actually remain equally as hydrating, if not more so, but less sticky due to the removal of glycerin? \n\n//\n\nTLDR: \n\nSo, apart from the ferment all the new additions are commonly used ingredients - nothing toxic, irritating or comodegenic! In theory (best case scenario) it should be even more hydrating due to the extra two forms of hyaluronic acid, and potentially less sticky due to the removal of glycerin and higher concentrations of urea and Diglycerin! Worst case scenario is that the concentrations of HA have been lowered and it won't have the same deeply plumping effect, only time will tell. \n\nThis is getting very long and my thumbs are tired so I'm going to end this post here even though I could potentially go on, hopefully this helps some people make an informed decision on whether they'd like to try the new formulation. I personally have already ordered a bottle as I'm not concerned by the addition of ferments and in general it doesn't look bad at all. Fingers crossed it's somehow even better than the original!!",

Here is my low budget routine:\n\n1) Apple Cider Vinegar baths in the tub once every 2 weeks. I have a Publix nearby with a 2 gallon Heinz jug FULL PRICE at $7.99. Fill a bathtub, add 2 cups of apple cider vinegar (or white vinegar), soak for 20 mins, then scrub with a gentle loofah and some pleasant soap.\n\n2) Sunscreen SPF 100 - $6.99 full price. Just adding sunscreen to my face has really improved everything about my skin. Had no idea it was that big of a deal.\n\n3) CeraVe Hyaleuronic Acid $14.99 full price. Slick this on after a shower\n\n4) $1.99 - glycerin facewash (generic stuff, pretty gentle). I use a cotton ball dipped in mineral pil tp remove my makeup and then wash with this.\n\n\nAnyways, I can't afford super amazing cosmetics. HOWEVER, my bare skin finally looks great. And for cheap!\n\nTips:\n\n* Keep your bathroom clean. Wash and thoroughly dry anything that touches your face. Wash your pillowcases. \n\n* USE COUPONS FOR EVERYTHING. Everything on this list has a coupon available. Publix has apple cider vinegar on discount now for $3.99... CeraVe coupons can be had via their website ($2 off, ill take it), its very possible to cut this down to less than $20 spent for 2 months.",

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

I use Pixi toner day and night, it's given me a really nice glow but it might've been too much use. I'm also using HA (unrelated to this post) but I think due to my dehydrated skin, it's becoming even more dehydrated. I will try TO's Mandelic and maybe alternate it with Pixi day to day.

Can I use some stridex pads and then throw some TO Glycolic Acid on top? Or do I want to wait 20 minutes in between each HA?\n\n3) If we are to wait in between HAs, then I wash my skin down to a good Ph to apply my first HA..but then 20 minutes later my Ph is going to be back to a 6. I wouldn't want to wash again, what do I do to repeatedly drag down my Ph??",

    "body": "About four years ago, I wrote the currently sidebar'd post, [\"Evaluating Your Current Routine\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1x1ubd/evaluating_your_current_routine_read_me_before/). In that, I recommended things to ask yourself and consider before buying new products or changing your routine entirely.\n\nI recently began blogging, but I wanted to bring these posts to Reddit as well for people who did not want to click out of the sub. \n\nLots of this is content that has been referenced over the years on this subreddit, as well as elsewhere. However, I understand the frustration for new users stumbling in, seeing product recommendations and terminology being thrown around, as well as an enormous sidebar. It's pretty anxiety-inducing. I also see a lot of people skipping from products to products, asking what to try next. \n\nMy goals with this series is to break down *what* goes into your cleansers and how it affects your skin so you are empowered to make better choices as well as understand some of the science that gets passed around.\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down your average, general cleansers as well as oil cleansers (or the oil-cleansing method aka OCM) and micellar cleansers. Let's dive right in!\n\n---\n\n**Introduction to Cleansers**\n\nCleansers work by dissolving or binding to things on the skin that aren't normally rinsed away by water, such as the waxes or oils produced by our skin.\n\nWithout getting too into the weeds, they are able to do this with surfactants  (or \"the thing that makes cleansers sudsy\"). The most common surfactants, and the ones you may have heard of are SLS and SLES (sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate). These ingredients work by binding to the lipids (oils such as jojoba oil or silicones like dimethicone) and then being whisked away by their water-loving properties. Once mixed with water, surfactant molecules cluster together into little spheres known as micelles. Some surfactants molecular size allows them to penetrate deeper into the skin (namely SLS), where they can bind to skin cells. As you can imagine, this is very irritating to skin, and is what causes the eventual drying that you may experience after using some products.\n\nSo by increasing the size of these molecules or adding additional ingredients, we get a gentler cleanser.\n\nIf you've hung out in any beauty circle, you've probably also heard chatter of pH - \"What is the pH of that cleanser? Have you tried the CosRx Low pH Cleanser?\". The pH value of a cleanser can have an impact on how harsh your cleanser is on your skin as well, and simply put, it's because the surface of your skin is naturally pretty acidic.\n\nGoing back to Chemistry class really quickly, you'll probably remember something called the \"pH Scale.\"\n\nThings on the left side of the scale (1-6) are considered acidic. Things on the right side (8-14) are considered basic or alkaline. And of course, there is what is considered neutral, or pH 7. Skin has a pH of around 5.5, but becomes more basic the further down into the dermis you go, reaching a pH of about 7. Why is this important, you may be asking? Well, if you think back to your high school Chemistry course, you may have remembered the good ol' baking soda and vinegar reaction. When this reaction -- called an acid-base reaction -- occurs, the baking soda and vinegar exchange atoms and form different compounds, namely water and carbon dioxide. This is because bases are compounds that generally want to donate atoms and acids are compounds that generally want to accept atoms.\n\nAs skin comes in contact with other ingredients, even water, the pH temporarily raises and other compounds are created. Fatty acids (read: acidic components) of the skin are removed.\n\nHealthy skin can usually re-balance itself within an hour or so. Some skin takes longer to do this, especially skin that is prone to irritation, such as skin with acne, rosacea, eczema, or psoriasis. This is why your boyfriend can cleanse his face with a Dial soap bar and have glowing skin an hour later, while you're busily slathering on layer after layer of moisturizer.\n\nUsing a cleanser that is closer to our skin's natural pH is the obvious solution to this problem, and most modern cleansers are formulated much better than those of the past.\n\nSo now you're probably asking yourself: *Well, how can I test the pH of the cleanser I would like to buy? And how do I know the surfactant isn't going to irritate my skin?*\n\nA general rule of thumb is to look for mild surfactants, such as decyl glucoside, or multiple surfactants, like decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside, disodium cocoyl glutamate, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, cocoyl methyl glucamide, sodium cocoyl isethionate, and lauryl lactyl lactate.\n\nYou should also look for moisturizers, like oils, ceramides, cholesterol, and humectants (water-binding ingredients such as glycerin, hyaluronic acid, or squalane). Avoid saponified oils (please don't use Dr. Bronner's on your skin) and bar soap.\n\nNow I know you're asking: What about oil cleansers then?\n\n---\n\n**Oil Cleansers**\n\nWhat if I told you that your grandmother was ahead of the game?\n\nNearly all of us have seen a tub of Pond's Cold Cream hanging out in our grandmother's bathroom or on her vanity. You might've seen her dab some all over her skin and wipe away all of her makeup with a tissue. She may have sworn by it as the thing that kept her looking young, and she's not entirely wrong.\n\nI like to think of oil cleansers as being broken down into two types of cleansers -- wipe-off cleansers like your grandmother's Pond's, and emulsifying cleansers like the translucent oil cleansers that come in a pump or tub.\n\nThe former -- wipe-off cleansers -- are the most common mixtures in the cosmetics industry. They are usually simple mixtures of oil and water, and are high in water content, which makes them inexpensive.\n\nThey spread easily and often leave an oily or richly moisturized feeling behind. They're typically purchased by people with mature skin, but are a great alternative for people with dry skin.\n\nThe latter -- emulsifying cleansers -- are also mixtures of oil and water, but are higher in oil content, which makes them more expensive. They contain emulsifiers that bind well to water, which allows them to rinse away in water.\n\nThe benefit of these cleansers is there is no real \"sudsing\" action on the skin. Indeed many of them can actually feel \"moisturizing\" due to their ingredient makeup. They are also excellent for breaking down make-up and other waterproof things, such as mascara, due to the high oil content.\n\nWhen picking out an oil-cleanser, look for shortened ingredient lists. Don't be swayed by extracts or other frills that will wash away. The oil itself will be the biggest point of irritation (or not) for your skin, so don't be afraid of \"boring\" oils like mineral oil or petrolatum, which is one of the blandest, most non-reactive molecules around.\n\nJust one more to go...\n\n---\n\n**Micellar Cleansers**\n\nMicellar water is quite literally made up of micelles, or the molecular bunches of surfactants that group up, their water-loving butts faced outwards. These larger bunches of molecules, diluted in combinations of water and hydrating ingredients (such as glycerin), are the most mild of cleansers.\n\nThe percentage of surfactant to other ingredients is generally so low that micellar water does not need to be washed away. This allows the hydrating ingredients, such as glycerin, to stay on the skin after the debris has been removed.\n\nThis makes micellar water ideal for sensitive skin or prepping the skin for product application, when cleansing with a standard cleanser and water will be too drying.\n\n---\n\n**All Wrapped Up**\n\nSo what does this all mean? Here are some general skin cleanser guidelines to follow:\n\n* **Cleanse your skin at least once a day.** At the end of the day, your skin not only has a build-up of oils, but also debris and particulates in the air.\n* **Don't pile it on.** Your non-sudsing cleanser does not need to suds to work.\n* **Two-step cleanse for removing make-up.** Most make-up is waterproof and does not easily cleanse away. Use an oil cleanser to break down the make-up and remove it.\n* **Use cottons to remove cream cleansers like Pond's.** The friction will help to remove grime and dirt. Splash with water after to remove any leftover emulsifiers.\n* **Use cool water when cleansing.** Hot water can make surfactants penetrate deeper by reducing the size of the micelles, which is why your hot shower is more irritating and drying to your skin than the less-fun cooler shower.\n* **Moisturize.** Even water strips away the valuable fatty acids in your skin. Using a moisturizer on your skin after will help your skin to re-balance itself quicker.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n\n* [Kind of Stephen](https://kindofstephen.com/)\n* [DermaScope](https://www.dermascope.com/ingredients/surfactants-and-emulsifiers)\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n",

    "body": "I know CeraVe in the tub is quite popular here, but I just wanted to provide a quick overview of other CeraVe moisturizers for those who aren't familiar.\n\n**NOTE**: All CeraVe moisturizers contain cetearyl alcohol/cetyl alcohol, which may cause breakouts to those who have a sensitivity to fatty alcohols.\n\n**Cerave Moisturizer Overview**\n\n[**Cerave Moisturizing Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/moisturizing-cream) (also known as Cerave \"in the tub\") is a thick, creamy moisturizer with ceramides, hyaluronic acid and petrolatum.\n\n[**Cerave Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/moisturizing-lotion) comes in a bottle and is a thinner consistency. It also has ceramides and hyaluronic acid but no petrolatum.\n\n[**Cerave AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/am-facial-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a small pump bottle and has a thick, creamy (slightly greasy) texture. It is SPF 30 and contains the following active suncare ingredients: Homosalate (12% - for UVB protection), Octinoxate (7.5% - for UVB protection), Octocrylene (2% - for UVB protection), Zinc Oxide (3.5% - for UVA protection). It also contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/pm-facial-moisturizing-lotion) (my fave) comes in a small pump bottle and is a silky/gel texture. It contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and places more focus on chemical exfoliation. Notable ingredients are mineral oil, ammonium lactate (similar to lactic acid), salicyclic acid, ceramides and a lower concentration of hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-cream) comes in a tub and is a thicker version of the SA lotion and contains similar ingredients with the addition of niacinamide.\n\n[**Cerave Skin Renewing Night Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/skin-renewing-night-cream) comes in a tub and contains shea butter, ceramides, niacinamide, peptides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and contains niacinamide, ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and allantoin (an anti-irritant derived from urea). \n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-cream) comes in a tub and contains glycerin, petrolatum, ceramides and hyaluronic acid. No niacinamide or allantoin in this one.\n\n**Notable Ingredient Overview**\n\n**Ceramides**: Naturally occurring, long chains of skin lipids (fats) that are major structural components of the skin’s outer layers. Skin as a barrier system inhibits water movement via its extracellular matrix, which has a unique composition of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% free fatty acids. Together, these lipids form what researchers refer to as \"crystalline lamellar structures\". Ceramides are necessary for the skin’s water-retention capacity as well as for barrier repair and cell regulation. Adding ceramides to skin-care products can help to restore the skin’s barrier system.\n\n**Hyaluronic acid**: Component of skin tissue that is used in skin-care products as a good skin-identical ingredient. Hyaluronic acid can boost skin's moisture content, reduce inflammation, have cell-communicating abilities, and help prevent moisture loss.\n\n**Niacinamide**: Also known as vitamin B3 and nicotinic acid, niacinamide is a potent cell-communicating ingredient that offers multiple benefits for aging skin. Assuming skin is being protected from sun exposure, niacinamide can improve skin's elasticity, dramatically enhance its barrier function, help erase discolorations, and revive skin's healthy tone and texture.\n\n**Ammonium Lactate:** Ammonium lactate is a mix of lactic acid and ammonium hydroxide. It is used as a skin moisturizer lotion to treat dry, scaly, itchy skin. Those who are using it should avoid exposure to sunlight or artificial UV rays, such as sunlamps or tanning beds. Ammonium lactate makes skin more sensitive to sunlight. Skin is more likely to sunburn. Use sunblock and wear clothes when exposed to sunlight.\n\n**Salicylic acid**: Referred to as beta hydroxy acid (BHA), it is a multifunctional ingredient that addresses many of the systemic causes of blemishes. For decades dermatologists have been prescribing salicylic acid as an exceedingly effective keratolytic (exfoliant), but it also is an anti-irritant This is because salicylic acid is a derivative of aspirin (both are salicylates—aspirin’s technical name is acetylsalicylic acid), and so it also functions as an anti-inflammatory.\n\n**Shea butter**: A plant lipid extracted from the karite tree that is used as an emollient in cosmetics. Shea butter is a rich source of antioxidants.\n\n**Ingredient Lists**\n\n> **CeraVe Moisturizing Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n>\n> **CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Active Ingredients: Homosalate (12%), Octinoxate (7.5%), Octocrylene (2%), Zinc Oxide (3.5%). \n> Inactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate and Boron Nitride, Dimethicone, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Hyaluronic Acid, Phytosphingosine, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n> \n> **CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Renewing SA Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Mineral Oil, Ammonium Lactate, Salicylic Acid, Trolamine, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 in Corn Oil), Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Dimethicone 360, Methylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Propylparaben, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Renewing SA Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ammonium Lactate, Salicylic Acid, Triethanolamine, Cetyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 in Corn Oil), Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Methylparaben, Edetate Disodium, Propylparaben, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Glyceryl stearate SE, Stearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Saccharide Isomerate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterols, Ceramide 6 II, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 1, Niacinamide, Hyaluronic  Acid, Caprooyl Tetrapeptide-3, Tripeptide-1, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Tocopherol, Allantoin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Phytosphingosine, Dextran, Xanthan Gum\n>\n>**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n>\n>Purified Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetostearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Emulsifying Wax, Niacinamide, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lauric Acid, Zinc Citrate, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Arginine PCA, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, EDTA, Sodium PCA, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer\n>\n>**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**\n>\n>Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Petrolatum, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nHopefully this information will be useful to people interested in trying Cerave.",

    "body": "This is my first time posting here. It's been about 1 year and 10 months now since I started my skincare journey, and about 6 weeks since the year-long breakout of cystic acne along my jaw line cleared up. I was having dinner with my husband who suddenly looked at me said \"your skin looks really clean. Like, luminous.\" I can't express how much it means to hear him say that, especially since I've lately just focused on keeping my skin clear rather than messing with it with too many products in my efforts to achieve \"perfect\" skin. Just wanted to share, as someone who thought I would never get to this point.\n\nEDIT: Adding my routine below, as many were asking.I started with skincare after hearing about the infamous Korean 10 step routine, went on a few benders and am now recovering. For the past few months, I've been trying to find more western, or European, brands to work into my routine - mostly for environmental reasons. The Asian product you see mentioned below are my HG's that I just can't find myself letting go of. My current routine is literally based on things my skin seems to like, and I'm being very cautious about adding new products as I really, really do not want to trigger another breakout.\n\n**AM**\n\nEmbryolisse Lait-Creme Moussant (Foaming Cleansing Milk)\n\nBoots Traditional Skin Care Glycerin and Rosewater\n\nThe Body Shop Tea Tree Imperfection Daily Solution (3-4 times a week, as it is a bit drying)\n\nRohto Melano CC Vitamin C Serum (This guy really helped me get rid of scarring from acne)\n\nCosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence (I stopped using this for a long time, as I wasn't sure it was doing anything. Recently reincorporated it again and I love it so much, it's so hydrating and plumping!)\n\nAvene Solar Cleanance SPF50\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PM**\n\nHada Labo Gokujyun Cleansing Oil\n\nEmbryolisse Lait-Creme Moussant (Foaming Cleansing Milk)\n\nBoots Traditional Skin Care Glycerin and Rosewater\n\nThe Body Shop Tea Tree Imperfection Daily Solution\n\nCosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence\n\nRosehip Seed Oil\n\nOnce a week, I use the AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution from the Ordinary followed by a clay mask (mixed with apple cider vinegar).",

    "body": "Gusto ko lang i-share yung review ko tungkol sa product na ito dahil sobra ang hype nito sa Tiktok. Nakabili ako nito nung nag live selling nito yung dalawang sikat na content creators sa Tiktok: Skincarebyruzz at Wearsunscreen.\n\nTingnan muna natin ang ingredient list nitong sunscreen (pwede din tingnan sa pic na nasa itaas):\n\nAqua, Glycerin, Octyl, Methoxycinnamate, Dimethicone, Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Leaf Extract, Hyaluronic Acid, Polypodium Leucotomos Extract, Baicalin (Scutellaria Root  Extract), Vitamin E, Niacinamide, Phenoxyethanol,Titanium Dioxide, Carbomer 940 & Fragrance\n\nComment:\nUnang tingin pa lang, kita na agad na ang daming mali-mali sa ingredient list na inilagay sa box. Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate ang tamang entry dapat dun sa UV filter na ginamit, hindi Octyl, Methoxycinnamate (pati yung comma sablay ang pwesto). Making entry din ang Vitamin E sa ingredient list, either dapat Tocopherol o kaya Tocopheryl Acetate ang inilagay jan (kung alin man jan sa dalawa ang ginamit), dahil hindi considered na INCI name ang Vitamin E. Meron pang isa, yung Carbomer 940. Carbomer lang dapat ang nakalagay jan, dahil ang Carbomer 940 ay isang grade lamang ng Carbomer at hindi ito tamang INCI name. Isa pa, since tinted itong sunscreen na ito, bakit hindi nakalagay ang mga pigments na ginamit dito (Iron oxide Red / C.I. 77491; Iron oxide Yellow/C.I. 77492; Iron oxide Black/C.I. 77499)? Panghuli, hindi gumagamit ng \"&\" symbol sa ingredient list kapag nasa dulo. \n\nNgayon tingnan naman natin ang ilan sa mga product claims nito namedyom problematic (makikita sa Pic 1 at Pic 3):\n1. SPF 50 PA ++++ UVA/UVB Sun Protection (Pic 1) \n2. Broad spectrum (Pic 1) \n3. Fragrance Free (Pic 3) \n4. Provides broad spectrum SPF 50 coverage using zinc oxide... \n\nAnong mga problema sa mga claims na ito?\n\nUna sa lahat, paano papalo ng SPF 50 ang sunscreen na ito kung ang UV filters lang na ginamit ay Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate at Titanium Dioxide lang? Kahit pa sabihin nating nakasagad sa 10% ang Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate na ginamit, malabo pa din mangyari yan. \n\nIkalawa, papaano na-claim na broad spectrum ang sunscreen na ito at may UVA protection, kung malinaw naman sa ingredient list na walang nakalagay na UVA filter? Ni hindi nga ito naglagay ng Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane (Avobenzone) para masabi man lang na may UVA filter ito.\n\nIkatlo, claim ng product na ito na may zinc oxide ito kaya naging broad spectrum. Paano mangyayari yan e wala naman sa ingredient list ang zinc oxide? \n\nIkaapat, nag-claim ang product na Fragrance free. E ang linaw-linaw sa ingredient list na may Fragrance. At nung ginamit ko yung product, meron ngang fragrance, pero hindi kalakasan, sakto lang para ma-mask yung amoy ng base. So basag na agad yung claim nito na Fragrance free. \n\nNgayon, tumungo naman tayo sa actual product use. Una kong napansin dito ay yung packaging. In fairness, cute naman ang bote, hugis araw. Ok sana tong bote kasi yung gitna nung bote e gawa sa squeezable material. Ang problema ko lang, nababakbak yung white na print, which is ok naman sana, kaso sumasama sya sa kamay kapag pinapahid na sa mukha yung sunscreen, kaya napagkamalan ko pang titanium dioxide na hindi na-disperse ng maayos. In fairness naman din sa product, hindi naman nag-pill sa balay ko nung ginamit ko na. \n\nFinal Verdict:\nKung hindi ko inurirat yung mga nakasulat sa box nitong product na ito, aakalain kong ok or matino ito. E ang kaso, ang daming mali at inconsistencies nitong product nito sa kanyang mga claim, kaya magdududa ka talaga kung maayos e. Di komo FDA notified ang isang product e maayos na. Kaya sa ating lahat na gumagamit ng skincare products, lagi tayong maging mapanuri sa mga binibili nating produkto. ",

I posted a TikTok regarding the “fragrance” part kasi how can they claim to be “fragrance-free” and have “fragrance” on the ingredient list. \n\nI also reached out to the CEO OF HIKARI via DMs and other skincare influencers (who are promoting it) to get their thoughts baka ako lang ang misinformed and I’m assuming incorrectly. I have not received any response pa. \n\nI also sent the company an email via their website and I still have not received any feedback I feel like I’m taking crazy pills (lol) \n\nI also joined one of the livestreams ng CEO nila and asked the question on live but it was just ignored. \n\nThank you for posting this it’s eating me up",

Hindi naman sa pagiging matapobre no, pero looking sa price point ng products ni Hikari Skin Essentials (not just their sunscreen but their rejuv products too) you will really question yung quality ng binebenta nila. Sorry pero it's giving Rosmar and Viyline levels na ang target market is low-income people na naghahanap ng madaliang solution to skin problems at a low price point, regardless of the sussy quality.\n\nIf anyone needs affordable na locally-made beauty products, better stick na lang to mainstream brands na available sa Mercury and Watsons. Sure, malakas mambudol si Watsons as we all know pero surely every single brand they sell (including theirs) dumaan yan sa maayos na R&D at quality control.\n\nAnd if kelangan talaga ng  products na may pangmalakasang support like sunscreen, dun na mag-invest ng magandang brand if your budget can accommodate it.",

Kung ang gusto nyo ba e matte o dewy, or kung pang daily use lang ba o pang beach. Ikatlo, hindi ko din alam kung magkano ang budget nyo sa sunscreen. Dahil alam naman natin na mumurahin, mid-range, at premium na sunscreen. \n\nAng tanging masasabi ko lang is kung meron na kayong ginagamit na sunscreen ngayon na inyong na-research ng maigi at kumportable naman kayong gamitin araw-araw ng walang problema, at pasok sa budget nyo, e para sa akin, yan na yung akmang sunscreen para sa inyo.",

    "body": "1. Hormones. Wether or not you are a moody moo in general or a pmt princess, get ready to feel emotional, this can happen within days of conception. I for instance, anger cried the entire way home from my honeymoon. It was a 10 hour flight. \n\n2. Tits. Your tits feel like they will fall off. They feel like they have been beaten by 5lb steak mallets. They are twice the size, and are super lumpy. This however sadly isn't even the problem. You will get electric shocks in your nipples which radiate to your back, it's like Zeus himself is lynching your areolas in some hideous Mother Earth pay back. One of the biggest changes your partner may notice is your new 'mum' nipples, You just wake up one morning with some massive dark burger nips that don't even look in the same direction anymore. Say goodbye to those two tiny pink perky girls. These new tits look confused.\n\n3. Metallic tongue. This is one of the first tell tale signs, everything you eat or drink tastes like metal. You may as well just lick a car bonnet rather than tuck into that pizza. It's going to taste exactly the same.\n\n4. Even though your tattas are twisted and everything tastes like pennies, I'm sure you are running around excited and loving life, especially the one you are creating right now, enjoy this ability to move freely and get in cars and hug your friends who are fond of strong perfume. This may not last.\n\n5. Morning sickness. Different for everyone, some people are nauseas for months and not sick, pretty shit. Others will piss themselves because they can't stop puking, end up on a drip for months on end and eventually cut off all there hair with the kitchen scissors because they can't stop puking in it. This is actually a minor breakdown masquerading as an educated decision. Very Utterly shit. Yes, I did literally cut off all my hair because it was constantly matted with vomit. Now I look like a cabbage patch kid.\n\n5a. Hyperemisis. The worst sickness you can get is the dreaded hyperemisis gravidarum. It is the only thing Princess kate and I have in common, I would have preferred her arse or her bank balance but alas no, I share the ability to projectile vomit. HG is where you can puke up to 50, 60 times a day, you can't drink water and may or may not be able to swallow your own saliva. I have no advice for you, I'm just sorry. You are now queen of the chunder games. Every room is your own public vomitorium. Sadly enough, the advice every stranger and maybe even your Doctor will give you is 'have you tried ginger biscuits?' If they do, you can wave any politeness and just punch them straight in the throat. This is the most irritating question in the world. Just get yourself down to A&E and tell them you aren't leaving until they give you the ‘needley juice bag’. This misery could end at 18 weeks, or you might be barfing till labour day, there's no answer. If you do manage to eat anything at all, best things to puke up are bananas, yogurt, rice pudding and weetabix with milk. Do not vom up popcorn, salad leaves, peanut butter, nuts or anything remotely spicy.\n\n6. Ptyalism. How do I pronounce that you say? ''tahy-uh-liz-uh m'' now what is this odd word? Well, if you get it bad enough, it's the destroyer of lives. It's the ability to produce so much excess saliva you fear death by drowning, you have to spit in a cup, every 15 seconds. It's not just normal saliva, it's like slimy spider webs. Totally rank, makes your breath smell like arseholes. This probably won’t happen to you, it can go hand in hand with hyperemisis which I had very badly. I woke up 2 weeks gestation and my mouth was full of spit. I then proceeded to spit 1.5 litres a day, and had to sleep with a bath towel in my mouth. It will ache your tongue and your lips will be sore, and you will want nothing more than to stop spitting. It is constant. During this time I had a function booked in with work and was on the print station, spitting into napkins constantly, keeping myself away from the public. A very well dressed woman came up to me and proceeded to speak for 3/4 minutes asking me all sorts about what we were selling, I couldn’t bring myself to spit into a napkin and thought I could swallow it. I went to answer her and totally fucked up, I let an entire gob full of spit fall down my chin onto my dress. It looked like a cheap home made adult movie closing shot. After 6 weeks of this hell I actually made a MacGyver saliva sucker out of a Breast pump and some medical tubing. I Just sat there with a tube in my mouth and it sucked the spit out into a baby bottle. I looked insane but had nothing left to lose, I felt rather proud of my invention. I will add, there is no cure for this. Just birth or if it naturally packs up.\n\n7. You stink. Your pits will whip up some serious B'O. So when you have your arms wrapped round the porcelain throne you could make yourself chunder even more! Congratulations, you are a walking talking gym sock.\n\n8. Gas. That's right, you can't stop farting and burping, you would give most truck drivers a run for there money, even if you where never gassy before prepare to smell some seriously nasty shit. On the up side, you can now have competitions with your partner, just make sure you crack a window. \n\n9. I am exhausted. I feel like an actual zombie, I keep doing things wrong and I’m yawning constantly. Please just let me sleep. I haven’t slept properly in months. I don’t want to talk about it. Just shut the door, get me a cookie. And piss off.\n\n10. Twat cramp. That's it, I said it. This is one of the things I had never even heard of as women just don't talk about it, your uterus and vagina are growing exponentially. Stretching, morphing, fulfilling it's bucket dream potential. Christ on a bike, it feels like you have been fingered by Donald trumps ego. It can even hurt to just sit down, the best advice I have is just to have a warm bath. The deal is, you now have twice the amount of blood in your body including your foofoo, so that once sort of normal; sort of okish vadge now looks like a giant veiny bulging monster, that's been punched hard in the face. It never looked like a designer vagina before but now it's not a far cry from a kragon. Mingin. Side note, this intense pressure can make you free pee, I say that, because your foof feels like it can piss itself wherever, whenever, kegals can't help you now princess. You are royally fucked.\n\n11. If your morning sickness does subside, you might get cravings, I have heard of some pretty gross ones, if you want to eat a lump of charcoal with tartar sauces, fill your damn boots. I just craved milk, literally 6/7 pints a day, they say you're supposed to eat an extra 250 calories a day whilst pregnant, the milk I was drinking was at least 1000. Do not worry about weight gain, you are literally making a whole person, and that person wants a fucking magnum.\n\n12. Piss, piss, piss. Your ever expanding uterus and growing baby will do two things, give you a big round baby bump, aww. And make you 'piss like a pregnant woman' even in the early stages. I know I have said this a lot already, but there is so much piss. Piss when you sneeze, piss when you laugh. Piss when you vomit. So much piss, all down your legs! All day! \n\n13. Constipation/diarrhea pretty self explanatory, you could have the squits for the first trimester, then not be able to go at all on your own after that, the baby slows down all your shit and then you can't shit. Shitty arse baby. I had to go to A&E and have two giant suppositories shoved up me, I will add, the doctor was an absolute fitty, which made the whole thing rather worse. The nurse who was in the room with us turned to my partner and asked if he wanted to leave whilst I was having this glycerin rocket fired up my arse. I immediately said to her 'if I have to have this shit happen, he's going to watch'. I will add, he wasn't the business end but I made him sit there for the whole show. Curtains close.\n\n14. This isn't a body changing thing but I wanted to put it out there because it's important. Woman you meet will tell you how wonderful pregnancy is. The problem I have with this is after going through this massive transition of not being able to take a dump, vomiting on your husband and feeling like your fannys been happy slapped, you get this perfectly perfect woman saying pregnancy was just the best time in her life and to enjoy every minute. Good for fucking her. It makes you feel like you are useless and bad at making babies. There is nothing wrong with wishing this would all end and thinking you're going to fuck everything up even before you get to the labour. Do not feel bad about yourself. I promise, You will eventually meet other pregnant women who hate this as much as you, they are out there. You are not alone. \n\n15. My burning heart. Radiating, nauseating heavy heartburn. I would get heartburn just looking at food that would give me heartburn. I kid you not. This literally happened. When the evil does arise It feels like khaleesi herself has just ordered a full military attack. When you drop something on the floor, you are just going to have to leave it there, the second you put your chest lower than your stomach, whoosh. Fire. If you can't swig a big mouthful of gaviscon, treat yourself to an icy glass of milk, or another magnum? What a complete treat petal.\n\n16. Sexy. So right now, you are not in tip top shape, you probably haven’t shaved your legs in a very long time never mind anything else, and you’re totally backed up. You have also, never been this horny in your entire life. \nWhat a juxtaposition. Even though you want to jump all over your partner, you know you can’t because you might puke on them, you need to pee already without anything else adding to the equation, and this new love gut will throw your center of gravity well off. The throws of passion have never been this much of a dilemma. Even so, with out all of these important factors to consider, the real kicker is, your partner doesn’t actually want to go anywhere near you, because you are the hairy woman who has been screaming at him for months on end demanding weird food at inappropriate times. He is exhausted. \n\n17. Do I have a cold? Nope, that's just all the extra blood and hormones in your body closing your nose. The technical term is rhinitis. It comes with all the symptoms of congestion. You lucky little duck you! \n\n17. Oh my word, my baby just kicked! If you start feeling baby move extra early and you know it is your baby, the comments 'don't be silly it's just gas' will really get your goat, erm, I think I know the difference between an upcoming fart and my unborn child? Some people are very connected to there body and have good intuition, if you think it's your baby, it's your damn baby! \n\n18. Itching stretching tummy.. shooting pains in your belly button. What fun. Your baby is stretching your ligaments and skin. Basically it feels like you have fucked off wasp and it now resides in your navel.\n\n19. Google. Between calling my amazing midwife and my Mum at random hours in the day, my google search history throughout my pregnancy period could only be that of an obsessive hypochondriac. ‘where is my uterus at 17 weeks?’ ‘if I push too hard when I poo can it hurt the baby?‘ ‘Should my legs be cramping?’ ‘can pregnancy lead to paralysis?’ that one happened at 4 in the morning, I woke up in bed and instantly threw up on myself, everything from the hips down was numb, I drag myself half way to the kitchen, collapse on the floor, piss my pants and puke. My husband comes downstairs and asks in despair ‘darling! What the hell has happened’ I meekly reply.. ‘I fell asleep on my back’. Queue rolling tears. How bloody over dramatic is that.\nAlas, I was not paralyzed, nor was I dying, but if you lay on your back it can slow the blood flow to your bottom half and baby, so your legs go numb as a warning sign. Wow.\n\n20. Who am I? So for months now you may have felt rather shitty, and cared less about how you look and appear to others. Mostly because you are so damn tired that I you just could not give a toss. What tends to happen is that you just don’t feel like you anymore, your body is just a soft protective layer of chub with the only purpose of nourishing your unborn infant. you are hormonal, everything is out of whack, and you can’t remember anything. This little love goblin of yours is slowly turning the once fabulous you into a stranger that can’t stop pissing themselves. And who also forgets birthdays.\n\n\n21. Fluffy tummy? You may be boasting some thick luscious locks right now, but with that also comes an excess of monkey fuzz. You look down at your ever expanding bump and think, Christ all mighty, there’s a hairy beach ball on my lap! I have never seen peach fuzz like it, and there’s even a few strays on your nips? Who would have thought this baby would turn you into an over sensitive king Louie! \n\n22. This girl is on fire. Can you turn the heating off love? You moan to your partner, as his bobble hat Clings on for dear life. It’s the middle of winter, the doors are open, the heatings not been on for days. Yet again, it’s all that extra blood, where’s Edward Cullen when you need him? Your inner temperature gage is totally bolloxed, and you are so overwhelmingly hot. For all you bitches pregnant over the summer months, I salute you. \n\n23. I dreamed a dream. Do not be surprised when you wake up in the morning and your first thought is ‘what the actual fuck was that?’ The day seems like a day dream compared to the realism of your actual bedtime dreams. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, you will never forget some of them. I once had a nightmare so terrifying my husband had to put on a night light. A fucking night light! I have never woken myself up screaming before. \n\n24. Sciatica. What the hell? Have I sat on a hedgehog? Nope, that’s either your baby thumping the nerves in your back, or your hips bones expanding, or both? This stings so much, it starts with an aching and then sprouts fire! Big electric shocks through your arse, legs and back. Fucking ace.\n\n25. You spin my head right round, right round. \nLight headed? Dizzy? Nausea creeping back in. It’s ok, no one has spiked your squash. It’s just your massive uterus putting pressure on you. Don’t get up too quickly, don’t lay down too long. Don’t get too hot, make sure you eat, don’t tip your head upside down. How bloody boring you are. \n\n26. Insomnia. I have written the majority of this tiny sad book between the hours of 1 and 4am. I am sitting here now on the loo typing this. Partly because I have been awake for an hour already and It’s 3.46am. partly because I still can’t poo. The night is young.\n\n27.. What was I going to say? I can’t remember, I am trying to listen I really am, I just can’t remember anything, I am a colander of a person. \n\n27. Energy! Wow, what a Burst of beautiful energy during your 2nd trimester!....Nope, fucking thought not. Just heartburn and fanny pressure still.\n\n28. But I hate mango? You may find that the foods that would have repulsed you are now your favorite things in the world. You could have promised me my weight in gold to eat a mango, not a chance in hell, they always tasted like fleshy soap to me, I’m now eating 3 of the delicious bastards a day. Nom..nom..nom \n\n29. ‘Not long now’ she exclaimed whilst pointing at my love gut! Nope, not even half way there, but am the size of a baby beluga. The surprise on her face when you sheepishly say you have 5 months left. Top perks currently include queue jumping. That is it. I already feel bad for the first stranger that go’s to touch my Bambino burrow, if you’re a blood relative or a close friend we are all good, but a stranger feeling me up in Aldi’s is a bit more than I can handle right now. \n\n30. It burns! Great, I have a UTI. Jesus Christ. When your tits hurt and you have raging sciatica, going for a burning piss is just the cherry on top isn’t it? Praise the lord for anti-biotics and cranberry juice.\n\n31. I stroke my tummy and wonder what my precious baby will be like? A girl? A boy? Or  just a smaller and more irrational drunk version of my partner and I combined? Maybe yes, maybe no, they might be completely there own person. I think most new mums wonder what there child will enjoy doing, what will there hobbies and dreams be? I feel baby move and just think, Please oh please, just don’t be an asshole. There are many in the world and most of them where born that way. Fingers crossed eh?! \n\n32. Perfect mummy. Did I take my pre natal vitamins. No. Did I order a blue cheese sauce on my medium steak. Yes. We are not perfect, we forget. I’m sure there are women out there who are just brilliant at popping those iron tablets and laying off the listeria goodies, but this is just that, women never fess up to missing there tablets day to day. My folic acid went out the window after I stopped being able to swallow my own spit with out hurling, and the minute I could eat again I completely forgot I was banned from a few things. I was just excited to chew! I wouldn’t recommend a molded cheese and pate platter with a mr whippy for dessert, but don’t fret if you make a mistake, you are human. \n\n33. Baby bump names. So I realised today that the only name for a baby bump, is a baby bump. This inspired me to think up a whole plethora of new names. Please pick your favorite and spread the word. \nFetus fun house, Love gut, embryo express, huff ‘n’ puff house, meatball mansion, midget mansion, raunch paunch, bambino burrow, asshole abode, rugrat roost, bubby cubby, lard lodge, dictator den, chunder chamber, love bunker, nausea nest, nuns nest, ovary Avery, spawn shed, heretic hotel and goblin grotto. Goblin grotto is my absolute favourite.\n\n34. Gender scan. The horror when you tell some people you want to find out the sex of your baby. ‘No’ They cry! It should be a surprise! I think the surprise will be ‘omg we have a fucking baby’ and then instantly how much harder things are going to get once baby is actually here! No sleep, covered in piccalilli poo, you and your partner disagreeing on burping methods. I am sure this will all happen. I think you will be surprised by a lot when the baby catapults itself out of your tiny mermaid purse! I think it’s cool to know the sex, I think it makes it easier to bond with the ever growing Womble inside you. Modern technology is here to be used, I respect anyone who doesn’t want to know, but don’t make anyone feel bad because you believe they won’t be as excited for the baby on the day if they already know the sex. They will be! \n\n35. The scan. I will say, I lived for seeing my little space prawn jumping around my silent movie uterus. Like mother like daughter, my baby is my graceful equivalent. She looked like me trying to flip my duvet over to the cold side, whilst spaced out of my nut on vomit pills. Not very delicate, and rather un-coordinated. Even so, It is by far the coolest thing I have ever seen. Just seeing this tiny alien baby wiggling around, I actually made this. This is incredible and amazing. I promise, every single second of pain is absolutely worth it.\n\n36. Bleeding gums. Whenever you brush your teeth, whoosh, you spit out a swirl of blood with the foam, flossing is the same.. best part about pregnancy in the Uk. Free dental, which is handy because my teeth are totally fucked from all the vomit now anyway.\n\n37. E.T’s finger. So I had felt twat cramp, and was quite used to this, but something to add to this is a sharp stabbing pain behind your hip bone, in your uterus, feels like your baby is holding on to a knitting needle and having a good poke around. Anything like this is bound to freak you out, especially as a first time Mum. So off I went, once again to A&E and they have to check I’m not in labour because I’m bent double and nauseous.. they tell me to lie back on a bed, put my heels to my butt and drop my knees, fml. I was justifiably un-prepared for a down under viewing. The very polite nurse sticks what I can only describe as E.T’s finger up my foof and blow’s the damn thing up! This was a bad Monday morning. Apparently this is just something that you can get, sharp stabby pains and they are totally normal? I’m obviously no doctor, if you have any uncomfortable pain, get yourself checked out. \n\n38. Twisted hips. So, my back aches a lot, I have been complaining about it constantly, so I get booked in to Physio. Turns out, I was right to complain, this little love nugget has twisted my pelvis, so now all my chakras and shit are out of line.. no wonder I have raging sciatica and a sore arse. \n\n39. Wow, Look at the size of you. You know, I know a girl who’s only a few weeks behind you and you wouldn’t even know that she’s pregnant! Crickey, your carrying all over aren’t you? Be sure to get some of that bio oil on your legs or you’ll end up looking like a tiger! Fuck off Margaret. \n\n \n40. Costochondritis, ok, so I am 27 weeks and am the size of a small detached house. Since my bump is super bumperlicilous there’s not a lot of room for all my organs, so my ribs are being pushed up, this results in really painful inflammation. It feels like you have badly bruised your rib cage and if you push down on either side at the base it is super sharp. You will be sad to know there is nothing you can do about this, I just sort of walk round holding my boobs up with my hands.. \n\n41. Mexican wave. Seeing baby move from the outside is so much fun! Swoosh, flesh wave! I’m now waiting for the point where I can tell which bit of baby is doing this? Foot? Hand? Head? Right now I don’t know. But damn it’s cute. \n\n\n42. Leaky tits.\nSo I’m in a meeting with a perfectly presented lady and trying to get a contract to do some work for her, we sign papers, shake hands and walk to our cars. I look down and I have one massive wet patch covering the entirety of my left boob. Fuck my actual life. I have officially started producing colostrum, it is not something I was prepared for and you can’t even feel it happening until you notice the dampness. My partners face when he sees it coming through my top is pretty hilarious though. It’s really weird that my boobs are actually starting to leak baby food. The next morning I woke up with two translucent milk helmets on my nips. Into battle we go my little lactose tattas! \n\n43. Tinnitus. Just wow, all I can hear is the crackle of rice crispies, whatever is changing in my body in week 34 is giving me constant tinnitus, it must be something to do with added high pressure blood. I have no idea, but it’s irritating the shit out of me.\n\n44. My arse hurts. Pregnancy is literally a pain in the butt. My tail bone feels bruised, whenever I get up or sit down or roll from side to side it hurts so much! It’s like I have been sitting on a monkey bar for 2 months.\n\n45. Stretch marks. I really thought I was going to get away with just baby weight. Alas no. I have earned my tiger stripes fair and square, they are very obvious already, and I think they will look much more aggressive when baby is out. Can’t wait for that stripy apron that I get to tuck into my knickers for the next year or so. Looks like Margaret was right.. eye roll. It’s ok, I’m creating an entire human and this is her first artwork. \n\n46. Mary Jesus and Joseph. I am huge. I actually make sound effects when I get up and have to be physically removed from low seated BMW’s. If this continues I am going to have to invest in one of those ‘I can’t wipe my own arse aid sticks’ second to that, I also no longer have ankles and none of my shoes fit. Man I look hot right now. \n\n47. So I read a while ago that you can get a little bit more discharge whilst pregnant through out the 9 months. Lies. No one told me it would look like I had sneezed in my knickers daily by the end of month 8.\n\n48. It took me 15 minutes to put on a pair of tights this morning. That is all. \n\n49. How is this even possible? It is 4 degrees outside and I have heat rash? I feel like I am on fire. This just makes no sense.\n\n49. It’s not waddling, it’s pregnancy swag.\n\n50. Here come the hemorrhoids. I honesty thought I would get away without getting these little bastards. I didn’t, I can barely wipe my own arse and now I have to contend with these little fuckers. I am so sad. \n\n51. Resentment. The level of hatred for the women in front of you in a queue for the ladies is unparalleled.\n\n52. Kankles. My legs literally go from calf to feet right now, my ankles don’t actually exist, I look like one of the characters out of wall-e. My skin feels like it’s going to burst when I walk and I can’t shuffle my arse down the road for more than 5 minutes at a time before I have to sit down. I booked myself in for a massage and the lady rolled her thumbs up my legs, she pushed the water back up my calf’s and into my thighs and I literally had to get up and pee it out. \n\n53. Either I am losing my mucus plug or my vagina has a cold. \n\n\n54. Holy shit balls. TBC....\n\n\nEDIT: Double holy shit balls! A gold post! Thank you so much! I’m celebrating with an alcoholic free cider and a burnt pizza! Oh how the mighty have fallen...",

I'm low-porosity and protein sensitive, which means most products (regardless of their intended effects) actually make my hair look worse. I get build-up easily and need to clarify weekly. \n\nAll kinds of protein and \"*hair strengthening*\" ingredients (coconut oil included) turn my hair to straw. I also live in a very humid country, so humectants (glycerin, agave, honey) are no good. Frizz central. Aloe is a double whammy because it's a humectant *and* protein mimicker.\n\nAs you can imagine, finding products is a nightmare. An expensive nightmare. I'm at the point now of returning to cheap drugstore brands, as all CG approved ranges include aloe/glycerin and coconut/protein.  \n\nIt's frustrating to see other people post immaculate curls, only to scroll down to their routine and see that they slather on *product* after *product*. Creams, milks, conditioners, custards, leave-ins, mousses, gels, oils, butters... It makes me feel like my hair is not good hair. \n\nLow-porosity hair can't be co-washed. It needs to be stripped of buildup. But it isn't until page 51 of the [CG guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q6Dj9WAZxlfBhJSyS5on2rw3-if5cOV3oV-dQ3B0AHA/edit#heading=h.mr0bpiq89trb) that low porosity is even mentioned. If I tried the CG method, my hair would probably break off. \n\nAre there no other people like me? Is this thread just full of people with great, regular porosity curls? What's the deal? I thought most healthy curly hair was low porosity.",

The other 80% of us are constantly splurging money on more expensive products trying to find their \"holy grail\" but keep failing. I think the problem is CGM itself.\n\nSilicones are meant to solve literally all the problems that we curlies typically have (lack of shine, manageability, excessive frizz, etc). The issue is that most people don‘t know _how_ to use sulfates and silicones properly. If you keep slathering more and more silicones onto your hair, of course you‘re going to seal your cuticles shut and create build up, which leads to dry hair. I have found that using a sulfate shampoo _without_ silicones does the trick for me. My daily conditioner is with silicones. This way I always remove the silicone with every wash, don‘t have any problems with build up and can simply swap my daily conditioner for a deep conditioner if my hair does start to feel dry. The silicone in my daily conditioner fixes pretty much all my problems.",

Hair care is the same.

I now live somewhere with hard water too which doesn't help as I get build up from that. \n\nNow I just use cheap shampoo, a nice rich conditioner that I just leave on longer and do a scalp treatment & oil the ends only. Best curls since I was a teenager! \n\nI accepted that if I want ringlets they will come with a bit of frizz and that if I want to refresh them I need to brush them out and spray them with water and air dry them again.  I use a curling wand and/or rags to fix individual bits that aren't behaving when I want to wear my hair down. So much less stress than pratting around with gels and creme!",

I know that clinically speaking there is no cure to sebderm and it may come back later, but I'm just happy that it's at least under control now. So I want to share this as my SOS protocol. As for long-term maintenance, I'm still learning so much about it from this community.\n\nBackground:\n\n\\- suffered from dry dandruff (large and white flakes) for more than 12 years but never experienced any hair loss\n\n\\- Because of COVID, I developed a bad habit of only shampooing 1-2 times a week (I have an oily scalp and straight hair). On non-wash days, I used a lot of hair products to keep my scalp feeling clean, e.g. scalp serum and dry shampoo. I only found out later that they contained denatured alcohol, which can destroy our skin barrier.\n\n\\- In late Aug, I experienced increased hair shedding of a daily average of 200-300 strands when I usually only shed a maximum of 30-60 strands a day. At the worst point, I was losing 500 hairs when I was shampooing one day. And I almost passed out.\n\n\\- My scalp was tingling, burning, and sore.\n\n\\- I went to a dermatologist in early Sept. He diagnosed me with severe sebderm and folliculitis on my scalp. He said I needed to get my sebderm under control before he could treat my hair loss\n\n\\- My before and after pics (warning: my sebderm was really bad on my scalp): [https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i](https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSebderm and hair loss:\n\n\\- I was very anxious and depressed about my hair loss because I've always had thick and healthy hair. People always give me compliments on how my hair looks. The point is that I was feeling so much pain mentally.\n\n\\- I consulted other dermatologists. Some said sebderm could cause telogen effluvium because my condition was so severe that it shocked my hair. Some said even though sebderm could cause increased hair shedding, mine was too serious to be caused by sebderm alone. There might be other causes.\n\n\\- But from Dr. Donovan's blog, there is a study that revealed that the more seborrheic dermaitits a person has, the more shedding (telogen effluvium) a person will experience. This tells us that individuals with severe seborrheic dermatitis are likely to have a severe telogen effluvium.\n\n\\- I still went to my family doctor and a naturopath to get blood tests done just to be sure what we're dealing with here. Everything was normal, so I focused on getting my sebderm under control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow I got the situation under control:\n\n\\- My dermatologist prescribed me with clobetasol solution and ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo.\n\n\\- At first, I was reluctant to use steroid. However, the longer my scalp stays inflamed, the more possible damage will be caused to my hair follicles, so I followed my derm's instructions and applied clobetasol to the affected areas daily for 21 days. My scalp was less red but I was still shedding 150-200 hairs a day.\n\n\\- Using the ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo (every other day for 8 weeks, as instructed by my dermatologist) was not very helpful. After much research, I came up with my own protocol that has really helped me get my sebderm under control.\n\n**- What I found is key is that the protocol needs to consist of three components: 1) destroy the biofilm, 2) kill malassezia, and 3) rebuild skin barrier. For each component, there are numerous ingredients/products available.**\n\n**- You can do all three components on a particular day or scatter them around throughout the week, depending on whatever suits your schedule and skin needs. Experiment and observe what suits your skin the best.**\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **on a given shampoo day**: 5% xylitol solution on the affected areas to be left on for at least an hour --> wash it off with an antifungal shampoo --> apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **in a particular week** (this is what I'm doing now): biofilm shampoo on day 1 and day 3 of the week followed by ciclopirox shampoo on day 5 and day 7. Each time after shampooing, apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 1) destroying the biofilm: xylitol, ACV, and selenium sulfide, MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 2) killing malassezia: ciclopirox, ketoconazole, coal tar, zinc pyrithione, and MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 3) rebuilding skin barrier: panthenol (vitamin B5), niacinamide (vitamin B3), glycerin, and aloe vera\n\n\\- Salicylic acid is not anti fungal per se, but it's great at removing the scales, regulating sebum production, and calming down inflammation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy detailed protocol:\n\n**-  I shampoo four times a week: Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide --> Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide OR T/Sal --> Ciclopirox 1.5% Shampoo --> T/Sal (I only use Selsun Blue twice a week for 2 weeks when things are bad because it is very strong)**\n\n**- This protocol is for short-term ONLY, e.g. 2-6 weeks! To get things under control first.**\n\n**- (updated on 4 Jan 2022) As my sebderm is getting much better, I have switched to this gentler protocol, which again incorporates all the essential components, for long-term maintenance. I'm rotating three different shampoos: Neutrogena T/Sal, DermaKB Scalp Detoxifier (biofilm disrupter), and Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Shampoo (contains an antifungal Piroctone Olamine). To hydrate my scalp, I've been using a DIY niacinamide and panthenol spray.**\n\n\\- Selenium Sulfide 2.5% is a game changer for me!! The dandruff/biofilm was finally coming off after 1-2 uses. Antifungals cannot get to the malassezia to do their job if the biofilm is present.\n\n\\- After shampooing, ~~I apply a DIY 3% panthenol aloe vera gel to my scalp.~~ I'm now using this DIY 2% glycerin, 2% panthenol, and 4% niacinamide in water spray.\n\n\\- Avoid ANY ingredient that may feed malassezia (I use a website called Sezia. Simple Skincare Science is also a very good source).\n\n\\- Even though I don't suffer sebderm on any other area, I switch all of my skincare products to seb-derm safe products because my skincare may transfer to my pillow.\n\n\\- I use a silk pillow case to reduce the friction (I can't afford to lose even one more hair).\n\n\\- I change my pillow case every 2-3 days and wash my pillow every week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct recommendations:\n\n\\- What is weird is that a lot of the products that are supposed to be formulated for people with sebderm are not sebderm friendly. They contain ingredients that feed malassezia. There is a useful website called Sezia that I use to check whether a product is safe (not affiliated). This is also the reason I need to DIY the panthenol and aloe scalp treatment.\n\n\\- Products that I like: Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide Shampoo, Neutrogena T/Sal, Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Scalp, dermaKB Biofilm Scalp Detoxifier, Philosophy B5 powder, the Ordinary 100% niacinamide powder,\n\n\\- Products that made my situation worse: Head and Shoulders Royal Oils Scalp Elixir, Inkey List Salicylic Acid Scalp Treatment, Head and Shoulders Clinical Strength 1% Selenium Sulfide\n\n~~- I will be experimenting with a DIY niacinamide and panthenol toner (for rebuilding skin barrier and calming inflammation) and 5% xylitol solution (for destroying the biofilm) and will keep this community updated of my results.~~ After much trial and error, I settle on this DIY scalp toner (2% glycerin, 2% panthenol, and 4% niacinamide in distilled water, which I think is really helpful for calming my scalp.\n\n**- Neutrogena T/Sal shampoo may be too harsh for people with a dry/sensitive scalp, but my oily scalp loves it!!! It helps get rid of the oily buildup and flakes on my scalp while also regulating my sebum production. My scalp is definitely less oily. And malassezia loves an oily scalp because they also feed on our natural sebum.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDiet and supplements (Please see here for a detailed wholistic approach to tacking sebderm: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/rggsrj/a\\_novelwholistic\\_evidenceinspired\\_approach\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/rggsrj/a_novelwholistic_evidenceinspired_approach_to/)):\n\n\\- Daily: Vitamin D3+K2, cod liver oil, ~~reishi, homemade kefir~~, nutritional yeast, ~~MCT oil~~\n\n\\- 2-3 times a week: zinc, magnesium glycinate, and collagen powder\n\n**- What I would recommend for almost everyone: vitamin D3+K2, magnesium, and fish oil.**\n\n\\- Around 60-70% of people in North America are deficient in vitamin D. There are also studies that point to an association between vitamin D deficiency and inflammatory skin conditions such as sebderm. Although this does not mean a causal relationship, taking vitamin D3 overall can help regulate our hormones and immune system. Magnesium and vitamin K2 should be supplemented with vitamin D3. This combo also help me better deal with stress, which is also a trigger of sebderm.\n\n\\- Fish oil supplement helps the body repair the skin barrier. It is also highly anti-inflammatory. But remember to choose a reliable brand. Many of the fish oil supplements on the market are contaminated. Brands I love that are also third-party tested: Nordic Naturals, Natural Factors Pharmaceutical Grade Fish Oil, and InnovixLab.\n\n\\- Probiotics that I've tried and quite like: Garden of Life Dr Formulated, Seed, and Visbiome (not affiliated in any sense; purchased all products with my own money)\n\n\\- Garlic powder supplement and oregano oil capsules daily for 1 week for killing the bad bacteria in my gut\n\n\\- Homemade bone broth for repairing my gut\n\n\\- Gluten-free\n\n\\- No refined carbs at all\n\n\\- No sugar\n\n\\- No dairy ~~except kefir~~\n\n\\- Lots of greens with some meat each meal\n\n\\- Berries everyday (there is a study that revealed a correlation between low fruit intake and sebderm in women). Plus, berries are anti-inflammatory\n\n\\- Avoid using vegetable oil in cooking. Opt for more heat-stable oils that are also low in omega-6s, e.g. extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil, ghee, and butter.\n\n\\- To sum up, the key is to incorporate as much anti-inflammatory food as possible. Some further examples are turmeric and ginger.\n\n\\- What I usually eat: [https://imgur.com/a/nr1JKne](https://imgur.com/a/nr1JKne)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSummary of helpful resources/research:\n\n\\- Simple Skincare Science website\n\n\\- Sezia Website\n\n\\- Dandruff Deconstructed Website\n\n\\- Dr. Donovan's blog (He has recently published quite a number of articles on sebderm)\n\n\\- Ceramide insufficiency in sebderm patients ( [https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(07)01771-9/fulltext#relatedArticles](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(07)01771-9/fulltext#relatedArticles)) ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12115025/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12115025/))\n\n\\- Niacinamide increases ceramide production ([http://fagron.lookhere-dev.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Atopic-Dermatitis\\_Nicotinamide-Tanno-O-2000-BJD.pdf](http://fagron.lookhere-dev.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Atopic-Dermatitis_Nicotinamide-Tanno-O-2000-BJD.pdf))\n\n\\- Caprylic and Polygalacturonic Acid Combinations for Eradication of Microbial Organisms Embedded in Biofilm ([https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01999/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01999/full))\n\n\\- Topical nicotinamide \\[i.e. niacinamide\\] for seborrheic dermatitis: an open randomized study ([https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/55117499.pdf](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/55117499.pdf))\n\n\\- Skin moisturizing effects of panthenol-based formulations ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21982351/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21982351/))\n\nFinally, I want to say that there is still hope. Don't give up. I will pray for everyone in this community to regain their health soon!\n\nEdit: I will continue to edit this and add on to it based on my ongoing research and trial and error. And also to add the things that I forgot to mentionEdit: Added some before and after pics and meal idea pics.\n\nFeel free to message me if you have any questions\n\nEdit on 19 Jan 2022: Now my scalp is free from dandruff with very mild redness, itch is very neglectable like only very mild itch every 5-6 days, and I'm shedding an average of 70 strands of hair daily, which is within the normal range of 50-100 hairs daily as advised by most dermatologists. This is my latest weekly routine (I shampoo four times a week): Neutrogena T/Sal Shampoo --> Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Scalp (start with as little shampoo as possible because it lathers very well; too much lather can be irritating to the scalp) --> Phillip Adam Apple Cider Vinegar Shampoo (Fragrance Free) --> Ciclopirox 1.5% Shampoo (available by prescription only; alternatives are ketoconazole shampoo and selenium sulfide). ~~Each time after shampooing, I apply the DIY hydrating scalp spray containing 2% panthenol, 2% glycerin, and 4% niacinamide.~~ No longer using the toner as the shampoos I'm using now are very hydrating and gentle.\n\nEdit on 23 Jan 2022:  I've just stumbled across some substitutes for this DIY spray from a brand called COSRX. Although they are not hair products, the ingredient lists seem pretty good. This toner ([https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/centella-water-alcohol-free-toner](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/centella-water-alcohol-free-toner)) contains panthenol and sodium hyaluronate, which are both good hydrating ingredients. This one ([https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/bha-blackhead-power-liquid](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/bha-blackhead-power-liquid)) contains salicylic acid, niacinamide, and panthenol. I'm probably going to try these out soon as I sometimes don't have the time to make the DIY spray. BIG **DISCLAIMER: These are not products formulated for the scalp. Use at your own discretion.**\n\nUpdates on 15 Mar 2022: I'm now using a routine targeted at healing my skin barrier because my scalp is now flake-free but mildly red. Shampooing every other day: ciclopirox shampoo once a week and Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo (if you have a really oily scalp, Briogeo Be Gentle Be Kind Matcha Shampoo may be a better alternative) for the rest of the week. Each time after shampooing, I apply some diluted niacinamide serum from The Ordinary because the original 10% may be too irritating. The study that suggested niacinamide as a potential treatment for sebderm used a concentration of 4%. I also added some panthenol powder to the mixture (at a concentration of about 1.5%), which is completely optional. I'm now shedding about 50 hairs daily.\n\nThe new HA hydrating serum by The Ordinary did not work for me. I tested it on my hairline, then the sebderm migrated to my hairline while my scalp, luckily, is still clear.\n\nUpdates on 12 May 2022: Shampooing every 2-3 days because my scalp is less oily and less itchy. Not using any topical hydrating product because I think my skin has healed so much. Now I'm using ciclopirox shampoo (by prescription only) once a week, and Bioderma Node A Shampoo for the rest of the days\n\nUpdates on 7 July 2022: Shampooing every other day; Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair once a week and Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for sensitive scalp for the rest of the week; taking anti-inflammatory herbs prescribed by a licensed Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner (TCM); shedding 40-50 hairs daily; scalp pretty healthy; incorporated more carbs in my diet because realized a low-carb diet makes me shed more hair\n\nUpdates on 28 Aug 2022: Shampooing every other day; Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair every 10 days and Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo for the rest of the week; been taking the herbs for almost 2 months now. Noticed my scalp is less oily, zero itch now, no flakes, and redness almost gone. There are some days where I'm shedding only 20-30 hairs daily, which is my pre-sebderm level. But I DON'T recommend visiting a TCM practitioner in western countries. Most of them have no idea what they're doing, and the herbs, if not prescribed properly, can cause damage to the liver and kidney. They are also not well-regulated under the law. My diet is lots of cooked vegetables, some berries, some carbs, and some meat. My TCM doctor told me to avoid seafood (except some fish) and beef.",

    "body": "Hey y’all,\n\nI wanted to review all the Isntree products I have tried over the past few years in one place for anyone who is looking into the brand. I find them to be basically unrivaled when it comes to ingredient lists, and have been tempted into buying essentially their entire line as a result. I get rewards through winning contests at work, and bought many of these in the 50% off sale on Stylevana, so I tried these gradually over the course of three years.\n\nI am at the halfway point between white and tan skin, I have dry skin in the winter/oily skin in the summer, and you’ll find my routine below:\n\nAM:\n\n1. Rinse with water\n2. Hydrating toner/essence\n3. Fermented essence\n4. Niacinamide serum\n5. Gel cream\n6. Sunscreen\n\nPM:\n\n1. Oil cleanse\n2. Second cleanse\n3. AM steps 2-5\n4. Heavy Cream\n\nI have a bias against serums in the way that they are less product for more money, so I will hold it against them if they're not justifying that. I also strongly dislike silicones, which is something else that other people won't necessarily share.\n\nI’m going to format it by product type, and will rate it on a scale of 1-5. You can assume I will at some point probably repurchase a product (on sale) unless otherwise noted. I have reviewed some of these before, so I will be using a bulk of what I said before on those with added updates. One final note is that I don’t fully remember some of these to give a full review, so some won’t have scores but rather descriptions and impressions. Alright, let’s dive in!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCreams:\n\nOnion Newpair Gel Cream\n\n4.5/5\n\nThis is a great option and one of their best moisturizers - I am shallow so I won’t lie about being obsessed with the slight purple hue. I’ve seen it retail from $10 USD all the way up to $40, and I have no idea why haha. It is not a holy grail hyperpigmentation treatment, but it is fantastic at evening out skin tone and giving you a nice healthy glow. It has 71% Onion Extract as well as Niacinamide, which are the two main ingredients I would purchase this for. While it has tranexamic acid, a vitamin c derivative, and a bunch of other great ingredients; they are probably all well below .1%. This does dry down pretty quickly, so it makes a fantastic daily moisturizer under sunscreen. What I love about this gel cream is that your face could be violently wet, but this would still apply like a normal moisturizer. It absorbs moisture and locks in whatever you’ve done before better than most, which is a compliment I’d pay to a lot of their gel creams. I wish this one didn’t have dimethicone, though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nC-Niacin Toning Cream\n\n5/5\n\nThis is a very similar cream to the Onion Newpair, but instead of a light purple, it’s a vibrant orange. Trade onions for sea buckthorn, and you’d get this product. This is better to me, though, because of the fact it is their cheapest moisturizer almost at all times, the lovely yet natural smell, and it is the best glow booster I have ever used. It dries down so well, but it will leave you with a glowy, hydrated complexion while staying dry to the touch. It is glass skin in a tube, essentially. The blend of oils, addition of beta glucan, and removal of dimethicone just overall makes this their best cream.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCica Relief Cream\n\n1.5/5\n\nThis is a strange addition to their catalog and it seems like they’ve phased out the entire line, perhaps to relaunch it as they do. It is one of those creams that further emulsifies on contact with water, so it becomes impossible to use if you use the wet skin method. It is legitimately impossible to blend in without white streaks. The ingredient list is impressive with basically everything you could ask for (especially the peptides whew), but its lack of utility would never make me feel comfortable recommending it. It is also piss-poor at locking in moisture because of this, which is again pretty point defeating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHyaluronic Acid Moist Cream\n\nImpressions: I did rate this in a recent point somewhat poorly, but in retrospect it really is a decent cream. I find that you need to apply it to a dryer face as it will end up not very significant on a wet face. I don’t find I have this issue with the aqua, but for this one I remember just not being able to feel any kind of locked in feeling I like to feel from moisturizers. I’m going to try it again one day, maybe this summer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHyaluronic Acid Aqua Cream\n\n4/5 \n\nI like this cream a lot, and have already repurchased it. I rate it lower because it is both not significant enough to be used alone most of the time, while also leaving a pretty glowy finish if used alone. I will typically use this at night before another moisturizer, and will use a more natural-finish sunscreen if used during the day. I find this to be intensely hydrating in a way most moisturizers fall short, however, and will stay loyal to this just for the punch it packs in that department. I will often combine it with squalane or hemisqualane to give it an additional oomph, but this is for sure a go-to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHyaluronic Acid Water Sleeping Mask\n\n5/5\n\nThis is an all-time great. They struck gold with this formulation, and I hope they never stop making it. I have bought at least 15 of these, and considering how much I like to try new things, something becoming a staple means something haha. I would describe this as a goopy occlusive containing almost no occlusives that somehow just works. If you use it as your final step, your skin will be well protected and wake up so hydrated. If you want to use it as a serum, it absolutely smashes all other hydrating serums and you only need a little. I will alternate between both using it as a serum and an occlusive depending on the weather. One drawback is that it is so THICK that you do need to melt it down in your hands sometimes depending on how much you’re using.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChestnut PHA Clear Cream\n\n4.5/5\n\nAnother fantastic product that is actually super new. They used to have a PHA sleeping mask that caught them in hot water because it had some fragrant extract (lol), but this updated version adds chestnut extract and removes any fragrance. According to their insta, they wanted this to be more of a daily moisturizer akin to the onion and c-niacin creams, and I’d say they mostly succeeded in doing this. The ingredient list is another humble brag, and I’d say overall this has helped me so much with daily usage. The benefits of getting minor exfoliation every single day kind of speak for themselves. I will say that this doesn’t dry down as well as their other daily moisturizers, but I would just use less of it if this bothers you. I also find it doesn’t “lock in” as well as some moisturizers do, but having a PHA 5% gel cream is just too useful for me to not love it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMugwort Spot Gel Cream\n\n4/5\n\nI’m gonna be honest, I find it suspicious that this doesn’t smell like mugwort even a little bit. I could add a drop of One Thing’s Mugwort toner and make this thing so fragrant, so I am just a bit confused there haha. This is very, very similar to the onion and c-niacin creams in the way that it locks in everything really well and dries down quickly. It doesn’t have Niacinamide, which is a bit of a drawback overall to me, but if you are one of the B3 haters out there, then this would be the one for you. It does a great job at reducing redness and was a great medicinal treatment of a burn I got recently. I’d recommend this cream up and down, but it is typically just a bit too expensive for what it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYam Root Cream\n\n5/5\n\nThis is a unique product in their line as it is their only moisturizer outside of the HA sleeping mask that aims to be heavy. It has 57% yam root extract with a bunch of other great, soothing/brightening extracts like rice, soybean, and oat. It also has 5 ceramides and cholesterol, which isn’t a common feature for them. This does dry down pretty well, but not nearly as well as the others, seemingly by design. It applies like a luxury cream and was so similar to Then I Met You’s Renewing Rich Beauty Cream that I just put the rest of the cream in that packaging and mixed it with hemisqualane to provide even more moisture. This is their best moisturizer for people with dry skin IMO\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIsntree’s Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel SPF50+ PA++++\n\n4.25/5\n\nI recently reviewed this on here and gave it a worse score and a mediocre review. I would like to publicly apologize. This is for sure not a summer sunscreen, but I find I can wear it almost all year round and look incredibly healthy without eating a single vegetable. (This is a joke please stay well nourished.) It is so oily on me if used in humid weather, and is one of the more emollient sunscreens I’ve used in Korean and Japanese beauty. In the winter I see that as a plus! It is a runny but significant emulsion type liquid, spreads really well and evenly, and is an easy sunscreen to reapply as it will never pill for me. Overall a big fan!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToners:\n\nGreen Tea Fresh Toner\n\n2.5/5\n\nI find that this toner didn’t do much of anything. I love the experience of using it as it smells amazing, but it has this slipperiness to it that I couldn’t really get behind. It is purported to have a complex that helps with oil control, but I don’t find this to be something the product does well. It has a series of botanical extracts, beta glucan, hydrolyzed HA, and allatoin. It is very no frills, and something I’d recommend if green tea works well for you. For me, this didn’t hydrate much at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHyaluronic Acid Toner Plus\n\n5/5\n\nThis is essentially a top-quality hyaluronic acid serum packaged as a toner and sold at an excellent price. I will forever return to it because if used sparingly like a serum, it can last you a year. It’s gorgeously goopy, smells just a bit funky, and will at times foam when used in large quantities and allowed to lather on the skin. I have been told this is not a red flag, and will pass this vague assurance onto you. Both this and the normal HA toner are composed of 50% HA aqueous solution, but this one has 5 types of HA rather than the 3 in the standard. There are a host of typical botanical extracts like centella, birch juice, rosemary, and licorice. Sodium PCA, beta glucan, and panthenol round out a beautiful ingredient list and a super hydrating product I have already repurchased. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHyaluronic Acid Toner\n\n4/5\n\nThis is a basic hydrating toner, and doesn’t try to be anything more. No active ingredients, no frills, just a solution of 50% hyaluronic acid composed of three different kinds, other humectants like glycerin and beta glucan; and some barrier supporting ingredients like panthenol and sodium PCA. It’s slightly more viscous than water, so it is far more dispensable than the plus version. As far as the effect of it goes, it is expectedly super hydrating, and softens the skin upon application. All of the other toners they have are like upgraded versions of this, so I won’t repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnion Newpair Essence Toner\n\n5/5\n\nThis is the perfect toner in my opinion. I often look for and extract based as opposed to water, 2-4% niacinamide, watery texture, and a decent amount of humectants; and this delivers on all in spades. I enjoy the purple color, and do find that the onion extract supports the product in a way that yields brightness and evens out skin tone. It has a skin-softening effect once applied, and feels like a burst of hydration. It is overall somewhat basic, but it succeeds. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYam Root Vegan Milk Toner\n\nImpressions: I dropped this product in the sink while it was full of water, so I threw it away after only a few uses. It is 80% yam root extract, and is otherwise what I would describe as a Cream Skin Refiner with a much more complete ingredient list. As far as ingredients, it has a well-selected series of oils like meadowfoam seed, argan, sunflower, and macadamia; a milk replacement themed list (lol) of extracts like oat, almond, and rice; and some barrier supporting ingredients like panthenol, ceramide NP, and cholesterol. This is a top tier milky toner, and I enjoyed it while I had it haha\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnion Newpair Clear Pad\n\n5/5\n\nI very much enjoyed using these in the morning instead of rinsing my face with water. The pads are soft, somewhat easy to separate, and are adequately soaked in product. The ingredient list is a bit simpler, and in my opinion better than the toner as it mostly gets rid of the botanical extracts to focus on the barrier-supporting ingredients like Panthenol, hyaluronic acids, allantoin and adenosine. The tranexamic acid and vitamin c derivative are also higher up on this ingredient list, but that doesn’t mean anything necessarily. Once done using this, my skin is super glowy and healthy looking to the point where I don’t know if I need to do anything else. These are often super expensive, like the rest of this line; but you will be able to find everything here for cheap on Stylevana at some point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSerums:\n\n(their new serum packaging is super ugly, will try not to mention this again)\n\nC-Niacin Toning Ampoule\n\n3.5/5\n\nThis would get a perfect 5 out of 5 from me if it were less watery. From my perspective, serums have a certain responsibility to have a certain viscosity to them so that they feel a bit more significant and spreadable on the skin. This felt like a toner packaged in 50ml serum packaging, if that makes sense. Apart from that, this is a top tier product. It focuses on superfoods like sea buckthorn, pumpkin, and turmeric; while having a great ingredient list featuring niacinamide at the top. It is a bit too basic for a serum, for me, as I typically will only buy serums for a buffet type product. This would get a 5/5 as a toner\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGreen Tea Fresh Serum\n\n1.5/5\n\nI found this serum to be super oily, and it broke me out. I really couldn’t tell you why when looking at the ingredient list, but I ended up using it on my body because I just really didn’t like it. This has a great ingredient list, but again I just hold serums to higher standards (as we should) and this is fairly basic for them. Again, if a green tea-based oily serum appeals to you, however, I would definitely recommend this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpot Saver Mugwort Ampoule:\n\nImpressions: I ended up just combining this somewhat early on with a One Thing toner and using it on my body, so I don’t deserve to rate this. I find this to be mid as far as mugwort products go, and that is overall the extract my skin fucks with the most. It has a perfectly serviceable ingredient list with beta glucan, panthenol, and ceramides all combining to create what is in the end an effective serum. I would recommend One Thing’s Artemisa Toner over this, though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCleansers:\n\nGreen Tea Fresh Cleanser:\n\n5/5\n\nI love this cleanser so much. It smells insanely good, has this amazing goopy texture, and it has tea leaves in it. I find that they don’t do much exfoliation, and I honestly never see them again after cleansing it off. It is surprisingly gentle for being so thorough. This feels like a luxury cleanser, and is better than almost every luxury cleanser I’ve tried for cheap. Count me as a big fan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnion Newpair Cleansing Foam:\n\n4.25/5\n\nThis was my HG cleanser for a while, and while I wouldn’t buy it again, I will describe it to identify why that is and why it might work for you. I have water that rinses cleansers off well, but when I go to other people’s places I find that film-leaving cleansers will be difficult to completely remove, which bothers me. This has your typical whipped creamy cleanser texture, with a slight purple tint. I am not a fan of this type of cleanser as it is everywhere in Asian Beauty, it a bit stripping, and is somewhat difficult to completely remove. If you are looking for a thorough creamy cleanser with added brightening benefits, then this is it. Final note: it smells like caramel corn. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nChestnut LHA Jelly Cleansing Oil\n\n1/5\n\nI would consider this something of a formulation failure in the way that it is almost impossible to get an oil texture out of this. Naturium also has a first step cleanser like this: it just spreads like a gel. You have to really rub it in, and I need to have some slip to my cleanser as I have skin that is sensitive to rubbing, so this wasn’t something I could really use. I also can’t imagine it is super adept at removing makeup as a result.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYam Root Vegan Milk Cleanser:\n\n4/5\n\nThis is a great cleanser for people who have sensitive skin, but only on wet skin. I used this as a second step cleanser when I wanted a non-foaming option, and it always left my skin so soft and well-cleansed. I don’t have too much purpose for it as I would prefer other non-foaming options purchased locally, but this is the best non-foaming AB cleanser I’ve used by far. It does, however, fail at being a makeup remover/first step as it is truly like a cream. It just sinks in. You can’t get any slip on it because your skin is drinking it up. Apart from this, I do recommend it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEverything Else:\n\nChestnut BHA 2% Clear Liquid:\n\n4.5/5\n\nThere are so many BHA liquids on the market, but this is a really solid one if you are looking. It is a simple ingredient list with 3 types of hyaluronic acid, allantoin, and glycerin. I have really not much to add - it is watery and thin, sinks in quickly, and is super friendly to sensitive skin. Peach Slice’s has the best version of this, though, IMO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChestnut AHA 8% Clear Essence\n\n4.5/5\n\nLike the BHA, this is one of the best options for the type of exfoliant it is. It is a massive upgrade from the previous version as it removes the fragrance and adds the chestnut extract, which I do enjoy. I find that when I use this, my pores look so clean and healthy. It has 4% both glycolic and lactic acids, which I enjoy as most multi-AHA exfoliants are mostly composed of glycolic acid with a low concentration of any others present. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMugwort Calming Clay Mask\n\n4/5\n\nI find clay masks almost all the same, so this doesn’t get altogether too much praise from me in the way that it’s very similar to other products. However, it is the best clay mask I’ve used as far as experience goes as it smells really nice (IMO), has large enough granules to not feel like a scrub, can be easily combined with serums or spot treatments (it will usually get really creamy like mint ice cream), and dries down quickly. I love the tugging/tightening sensation of clay masks, and I will say this one does deliver.\n\nSo that’s it! I clearly love this brand. I want to acknowledge that people aren’t always big fans because they use preservatives that have not historically yielded the desired results. I have never had a product go bad on me, and I haven’t experience a product becoming less effective quickly. That doesn’t mean this hasn’t happened, though; as I have seen a lot of people on this sub mention it. I don’t know where Isntree is at with this, but it hasn’t impacted my experience in any capacity.\n\nIn looking at my reviews, I definitely prefer their toners and creams over everything else. If you have any questions for me, I am here! Thank you for reading.",

This can lead to more innovative formulations.\n2. **Competition:** Korea has a highly competitive skincare market. Brands strive to stand out by offering high-quality products with diverse ingredients at affordable prices.\n3. **Research and Development:** Korean skincare companies invest heavily in research and development, enabling them to create effective formulations that incorporate multiple beneficial ingredients.\n4. **Cultural Emphasis:** In Korean skincare culture, there's a strong emphasis on sun protection and overall skin health. This drives demand for feature-rich sunscreens.\n5. **Local Sourcing:** Access to a wide range of locally sourced ingredients can help keep production costs down.\n\nEuropean sunscreens, on the other hand, may have more stringent regulations that limit the types and concentrations of active ingredients. This can lead to simpler formulations focused primarily on UV protection.\n\nIt's important to note that while Korean sunscreens offer a wealth of beneficial ingredients, individual reactions to skincare products can vary. What works well for one person may not be suitable for another. Always perform a patch test when trying a new product, and choose sunscreen based on your specific skin needs and concerns.",

        "body": "I've been into kpop and Korean and Japanese skincare for....awhile. like 2008 awhile. \nAt least back then, skincare was not a premium (for Asia). It was always cheap, relatively speaking for the quality you'd get. Whereas it was considered a little small luxury where I lived. Not $60 per cream luxury but still to have a line of skincare as a teenager was still expensive and the skincare wasn't that great per price in comparison.\nIn Korea and Japan, skincare is just something everyone did/does, it's been a thing for awhile, it's cheap, and widely accessible and the cultural emphasis on having good skin is just important. (Like how facemasks even back then were 50 cents to $1 USD, for example. Or a really good moisturizer was $8. Whereas on par with face masks (at the time) was $5 a piece and moisturizer was $12 and not as elegant or formula driven). I assume it's the same since 2008 to now. Having something widely accessible and time to research and a culture that emphasizes sunscreen, skincare and taking care of your skin, I believe these are all ways that has made skincare on average, cheaper to having a complete/buy a line of skincare for men and women, teens alike. That popularity also gives rise to experimentation. Also, I have been using snail mucin since the 2000s. It's \"disgusting\" (at the time at least) in the west but wildly open in eastern cultures. So when you are more open to experimentation as well with ingredients, and you have a demand from men and women, you have more opportunities to make something great. Also Japanese brands (were) and still are known for basic, working ingredients. Nothing too complicated but they work. And having it be built off other Japanese products is also successful (like Japanese use rice in a lot of their ingredients. Lots of modern skincare is just edited versions of what their grandparents used. Shishedo for example is also just less expensive over there).",

    "body": "Many years ago, a group of mages devised a way to imbue food with magic, creating a magical jam that tasted really well and had powerful magical effects. Their organization produced and sold their jams all over the world and the planes, rapidly becoming one of the wealthiest and most powerful organizations in the universe, their recipes a closely guarded secret.\n\nKingdoms fell and rose with a word, wars were fought and legends created, at the direction of those mages. The wealth they amassed was rivalled only by the greatest archfiends and oldest dragons. \n\nTheir magical jam was called **Spelljam** and the people creating them **The** **Spelljammers**\n\nBut with power came enemies, and in the end, the Spelljammers were destroyed by a coalition of forces from all over the planes. The spelljam factories destroyed, and the secret recipes lost in the chaos.\n\nLost, but not forgotten. Today, centuries later, many people still look for the lost recipes. Owning even a single one, becoming a new Spelljammer, could bring immense wealth and power to anyone.\n\nThere are 8 recipes, one for each school of magic, each with different powers, taste and value. \n\n-----------------------------\n\n **Finding a recipe**\n\nIt's no easy task: the recipes have travelled all over the universe, some buried in forgotten ruins, other hidden in a dragon's hoard. They could be in a secure vault, or at the bottom of the ocean carved into the bones of a dead Leviathan. They could be hidden by a family that has passed it down from a generation to the next, or in the hands of a great demon willing to sell it to the highest bidder. Finding a recipe should be an adventure in itself.\n\nAnd perhaps someone else has already found one and begun producing it. \n\n-------------------------------------\n\n\n**Creating the spelljam**\n\nThe ingredient of a Spelljam are fruits, sugar, water, a number of herbs depending on the type of jam being made. The jam requires a number of arcane components and a magical circle, then a spell of the correct type needs to be cast every day during the preparation process. The spell energy is absorbed by the jam, so it doesn't do anything.\n\nThe exact procedure changes for each Spelljam.\n\nThe spell needs to be of at least level 3, weaker spells don't have enough power to give to the jam and will create a tasty but non-magical paste of little value.\n\nHigher level spells will produce tastier jam.\n\nLevel 9 spells add special effects to the jam, creating what's known as a \"True Spelljam\", these are extremely rare and their taste is divine, the few that tried them were barely able to describe it, crying in joy or laughing uncontrollably. \n\n-------------------------------------\n\n**Consuming the Spelljam**\n\nA portion of Spelljam can fill a small bowl, and be eaten easily by any person. The magical effect acts without requiring any check. Spelljam never spoils naturally, but can be ruined if exposed to powerful magical energies. \n\nEating more than one serving of spelljam is dangerous: one must wait before the effect of the magic is over, or they risk an overdose.\n\nIf one tries to eat more than one serving, they must pass a **DC 20 constitution check**. In case of failure they will puke all the jam, lose its effect, and gain one level of exhaustion for the next 24 hours. While sick they are also unable to eat more. Attempting to eat more will just cause them to puke with no effect, wasting the jam.\n\nIf one passes the skill check, they gain the effect of both jams.\n\nIf one then tries to eat a third, fourth or more portions, the DC grows by 10 for each attempt, and so do the levels of exhaustion gained in case of failure \n\n(**Example**: If one eats 4 spelljams, they'll have to pass a DC 20  a DC 30 and a DC 40 check, and gain 1, exhaustion if they fail the first, 2 if they fail the second and 3 the third.)\n  \n-------------------------------------\n\n\n**The 8 Spelljams**\n\nEach spelljam has a description of its taste, with the testimony of someone that ate a portion of it. \n\nA list of ingredients (for one serving), a preparation time, an effect and a special effect when a 9th level spell is used, plus a location where it can be found.\n\nThese recipes are lost, so many of their details are unknown and will be left to each DM imagination. This list just wants to give a few examples.\n\n**WARNING**: some of these effects may be stupidly imbalanced, I just did whatever seemed flavourful, feel free to change or disregard anything seems too much or too little, I'm well aware they are nowhere near balanced.\n_____________________\n\n- **Abjuration**\n\n*Bit embarrassing to say, but... it felt like I was being hugged by me mum, felt like everything was ok and all the bad in the world was gonna go away, just felt like curling up and sleeping while sucking me thumb. God I'd kill to have more.* - Barolon Marbleshield, Dwarf Noble.\n\n**Look and taste**: The magic of protection, it's a thick light-blue jam, cold to the touch. When eaten, it gives a warm and cosy feeling that spreads all over the body, and the sensation that everything will be alright. It was a very popular jam.\n\n\n**Ingredients**: Water; Sugar; Cantaloupe; Hydrangea flowers that grew around a nursery;  a tear of happiness. Pearl Dust.\n\n**Preparation Time:** 1 week.\n\n**Effect**: For 24 hours, +2 to AC and advantage on all saving throws. \n\n**True Spelljam effect**: For 24 hours, damage reduction against everything. \n\n**Location**: Unknown.\n_____________________\n\n- **Conjuration**\n\n*No known description of its taste*\n\n**Look and taste**: A jar of conjuration spelljam is empty. When mimicking the act of eating from it, the jam will appear in one stomach. It has never been tasted and isn't clear if it's possible to do so. Never was a popular jam.\n\n**Ingredients**: Water, sugar, five of any fruit but collected in five different plantations. Wolf hair, gryphon feathers, 1 gemstone that has been teleported at least 3 times. \n\n**Preparation Time:** 1 week, but the spelljam will disappear during the process, meaning the Spelljammer must mimic the preparation, pretending the jam is still there. Very hard to make. \n\n**Effect**: Unknown\n\n**True Spelljam effect**: Unknown\n\n**Location**: It is said the recipe will appear if someone just calls for it in the right location. Some say it's a certain mountain in the astral plane, others of a busy market in the underworld.\n\n_____________________\n\n- **Divination** \n\n*I felt the stew my grandma used to make, but it also had a bit of the broth I had to eat when I was in college, it tasted like this morning breakfast and then, it was really weird, I felt the taste of a stake and a soup and a fried eel they make in 3 different places in Waterdeep, but I've never been there, I'll go to Waterdeep next year. How do I know what I'll eat there? I don't know how, but I know.* - Jimbo Hhappyfoot, halfling merchant.\n\n**Look and taste**: Transparent liquid, similar to water, when looking at it directly. If looking with the corner of your eye you could see any colour or shape. It tastes like everything you've ever tasted and will ever taste. It was the rarest and most expensive jam, by far. Also the most complicated to make.\n\n**Ingredients**:Water, sugar, twenty grams of uncut diamonds. Something you wore yesterday, something you were gonna wear tomorrow. Peaches. Lotus flowers.\n\n**Preparation Time**: 77 days.\n\n**Effect**: Minor foresight, equal to the spell of the same name but lasts 1 minute. For 24 hours, gain effects equivalent to the spells *See invisibility*, *Find Traps*, *Tongues* and *Detect Magic*. \n\n**True Spelljam effect**: Effect equivalent to the spell *Foresight* for 8 hours, all previous effects, plus allows you to see one moment in the future of one creature or location in the next 10 years. \n\n**Location**:Unknown, but some say it's not in a place in space, but in a place in time.\n_____________________\n\n- **Enchantment** \n\n*I ate it and I told myself, Findal, you like this. And I did. Never felt so confident in my life. I was like - I asked myself, Findal, you're smart, why don't others do what you say? I really felt like I should be the king of all elves, you know?* Findal, elf criminal accused of attempted regicide and conspiracy to overthrow the kingdom.\n\n**Look and taste**: The magic of control, it's an almost solid grey goop, of unclear taste. People just seem to \"know\" it tastes good, but aren't able to explain why. It just does.\n\n**Ingredients**: Water, sugar, apples, used manacles, three meters of rope, 250 gold coins.    \n\n**Preparation Time**: 10 days.\n\n**Effect**: Extreme confidence, that gives immunity to all fear effects, advantage to resist all types of mental compulsion and advantage on all skill checks to influence other people. May cause extreme recklessness. \n\n**True Spelljam effect**: For 24 hours, Once every hour, you can create an effect equivalent to the spell \"Dominate Monster\" just by speaking and giving an order. \n\n**Location**: written on a napkin by an unknown author, currently at the bottom of a drawer in the house of Mr. Hermann schmidtz, restaurant owner in Baldur's Gate. \n\n_____________________\n\n- **Evocation** \n\n*Was as if an army of devils started dancing on my tongue, it was really weird, kinda exhilarating in a way, but I couldn't eat anything else all day. If I had been 20 years younger I may have loved it. Maybe with some drugs too.* - Tobias, human leader of a thieves guild.*\n\n**Look and taste**: The magic of creating all elements, it's a mess: a dozen different colours swirling and twisting without mixing, some points are cold and other hot. The taste is at the same time bitter and sweet, salty and sour, umami and tingly, it's spicy and mint-fresh. Ozone, iron and sulfur. All at once. Popular with young people and artists.\n\n**Ingredients**: Water, sugar, grab a dozen different types of fruits with your eyes closed and throw them in. Rust scraped from a kitchen tool, sand and half a glass of wine. \n\n**Preparation Time**: 2d4 days.\n\n**Effect**: For 24 hours, all elemental damage is reduced by 3. \n\n**True Spelljam effect**: For 24 hours, one randomly selected element deals no damage and instead heals you.\n\n**Location**: Elemental plane of fire, City of Brass, carven in a red dragon skin hidden somewhere.\n_____________________\n\n- **Illusion** \n\n*What's a spelljam? What? This isn't a roasted pig? What about the potatoes? Are you crazy?*\n\n**Look and taste**: Illusion Spelljam isn't jam. Instead, it will take the shape, texture, smell and taste of some other food. What it turns into seems to be random, and changes randomly. It's always very tasty food tho. Somewhat popular, but hard to explain to your clients what they're actually eating.\n\n**Ingredients**: glycerin, salt, an apple painted blue, a Pear painted red, a green pumpkin and a yellow watermelon. 5 pounds of Pyrite. One counterfeited signature. \n\n**Preparation Time:** The recipe says 7 days but it can take anywhere from 5 to 9.\n \n**Effect**: For 24 hours, effect equivalent to the Invisibility spell, advantage on all checks to discover illusions. Also you'll instinctively learn ventriloquism. \n\n**True Spelljam effect**: For 24 hours you gain True sight and Greater Invisibility. \n\n**Location**: There are more than 700 reported copies of this recipe around the world, all different.\n_____________________\n\n- **Necromancy** \n\n*The most disgusting broth I've ever had to eat, felt like death itself had set camp on my tongue and was taking a dump after a night of vodka and roasted beans. It was so bad all the other bad things in my life started tasting kinda good in comparison, so there is that, I guess.* - King Julius the Fiftieth.\n\n**Look and taste**: A thick, black and green boiling paste, smells and tastes horrible. It requires a Constitution check with DC 15 to not throw up when eating it. The positive is, after that you can eat anything. You could drink swamp water and feed on a rotting rat carcass and not only you won't get sick, they will taste pretty good too. Actually good food will taste like heaven. Still not a very popular jam.\n\n**Ingredients**: Water where a dead body has been for at least a week, no sugar. Rotten Avocado. Jewellery stolen from a grave worth at least 200 pieces of gold.  \n\n**Preparation Time**: 3d6 days.\n\n**Effect**: Permanent immunity to all natural sicknesses. For 24 hours, immunity to natural poisons, advantage on saving throws against magical poison, sickness and death effects.\n\n**True Spelljam effect**: Permanent immunity to all sicknesses and poisons, for 24 hours damage reduction 5 against acid and advantage against death effects and on all saving throws to not die. You will appear to be dead to any scrying or investigation spell.\n\n**Location**: Unknown.\n_____________________\n\n\n- **Transmutation** \n\n*No way to describe its taste (see below)*\n\n**Look and taste**: Transmutation Spelljam looks like another type of Spelljam. The only way to realize you've eaten transmutation and not a different variety is from its effect. Otherwise, it's in everything identical to some other version.\n\n**Ingredients**: Water, sugar, tomatoes, apples, cherries. 1 kg of lead, 1 kg of gold.\n\n**Preparation Time**: 20 days. \n\n**Effect**: For 24 hours, Once per minute the subject can cast one between Gaseous Form, Alter self, feather fall, Meld into stone or Stone shape. They can also turn up to 1 cubic meter of inanimate material they touch into another material of the same type(liquids into liquids, solids into solids etc.)\n\n**True Spelljam effect**: Like above, but instead of once per minute the spells can be used once per round. The subject also gainst the ability to cast Once either Mass Polymorph or True Polymorph. \n\n**Location**: Owned by the Largeshow family, a wealthy gone family attempting to produce it. ",

Probably the one everyone is going to latch onto is that Subculture shadows are based on talc, whereas MR shadows are based on mica, but it looks like the entire formula got changed between the two palettes. This likely explains why people are having problems with Subculture not blending in as well as MR, as well as some major kickback issues.\n\nInterestingly enough, the ingredients for MR aren't [listed on the ABH website](http://www.anastasiabeverlyhills.com/modern-renaissance-palette/ABH01-18170.html).

    "body": "It wasn’t even snowing when I left for work but by the time I was halfway there, the roads were coated in ice. People were sliding around like real-life bumper cars and there were accidents blocking every path to the office. With all roads blocked, I decided to just give up and turn for home.\n\n\nI was being cautious, creeping along in my little Echo at about 15 miles per hour. Down the road a stretch, I spotted a Toyota truck coming towards me around a curve, fast. He had to be going at least 70 miles per hour. He seemed, at first, to be flying by on my left. Then, he was sliding sideways in a long, silver smear.\n\n\nIt’s true that time slows down when you are about to die. I saw the clock click from 7:25 to 7:26. I looked at my hands, noticing every vein, every line. Heard the words of the Imogen Heap song I was listening to, “Where are we? What the hell is going on?\" I thought, “I can get out of this.\" Looked right: cement utility pole, ditch, looked left: silver pickup truck. I thought, “I *really* can’t get out of this.\"  I saw particles of dust seeming to glow, suspended, in the air.\n\n\nThen there was crunching and spinning and glass and spinning and *pain* and then - suddenly darkness.\n\n\nI was alone in the darkness for a while, and then I wasn’t alone. Darkness, heavy but awake, consuming me. I somehow *was* the darkness, and yet I was still very much myself. Or, I should say, I recognized myself in the darkness. Then I heard a rush of whispers and long low whistles. As the sounds grew louder, waves became particles and two forms started to appear. Mine, and hers. A shifting, swirling woman was standing in front of me. Like blowing smoke into a sunbeam that’s coming through a gap in the curtains. Smoke all around, but only seen as it swirls through the sunbeam. She was like that. I could see that she had shoulder length brown hair, and she was wearing a light blue shirt and white pants. She appeared to be rather tall, but not as tall as me. I was watching her patterns shift and swirl when she spoke.\n\n\n“Olivia?”\n\n\n“I’m...I...yes, I... Who are you?\" Not too eloquent, but that’s what I said.\n\n\n“You can think of me as Mora.\" I could hear her, even though her mouth wasn’t making noise when she spoke.\n\n\n“How...?” I gestured around us at the endless, swirling black.\n\n\n“Everything is happening at once. All at once, right now. The leading edge is the same as the very end of the line,\" she answered. The more she spoke, the more she seemed to be slowly unraveling.\n\n\n“I don’t know what that means.\"\n\n\n“That’s ok.\"\n\n\n“But, I mean, what’s going on?\" I was getting dizzy trying to focus on her as she shifted in and out of form. It was making me impatient.\n\n\n“The universe itself is afraid of its own end. Consciousness in form is the universe's way of awakening to its own immortality. In the silence of the void, there is a voice. The voice *listening to itself*. The voice *realizing it IS the void*, and the void is alive. There is circle after circle of understanding. Do you understand?\"\n\n\n“No.\"\n\n\n“That’s ok.\"\n\n\nI waited for her to say something else, but she was silent. She was evaporating into a horizontal mist. Looking down I saw that I was starting to do the same.\n\n\n“Why are you telling me these things?\" I asked, distracted again by the swirling particles.\n\n\n“Because we need you. So I need you to wake up.\"\n\n\nAs soon as she said, “wake up,” I felt myself being pulled like a yo-yo on a string. Snapping backwards in the darkness. I watched my own particles blowing away from me like dust. Leaving a mist trail in what appeared to be a long, dark tunnel. Then the darkness shifted to the familiar darkness that lives behind my eyes. I felt my body, my real solid body, and then I felt the pain. Next, I noticed I was suffocating. Warm, humid, air was breathing itself for me through a respirator. I must have started to flail around in my panic because I was given a shot and then I fell asleep.\n\n\n\nWhen I woke up again, the doctor told me I lost consciousness after impact. I was rushed to surgery for internal injuries. Apparently I 'died' on the operating table. They \"shocked me back\" and put me on life support. The accident broke my sternum, three ribs, my right knee, and resulted in severe closed head trauma. Because of my internal injuries, they had to remove a nice chunk of bowel. I mimed, “I want to write\", by using a finger to scribble over the opposite palm. The doctor pulled a pad and pen out of his pocket and handed it to me. His eyes were a dusty shade of blue, the color of cornflowers. \n\n\n“When can I go back to work\"? I wrote.\n\n\n“That’s tricky\", he said. “We’ve left you with essentially what we’d call short gut syndrome which can result in intermittent incontinence. Head injuries such as yours often result in severe migraines. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves though. You’re going to get stronger every day, I promise. Let’s get you off this respirator and take it one step a time. Sound good?” No. It did not sound good. With no family of my own, my job was my life. Still, I nodded. What else was there to do?\n\n\nI was on the respirator for two more warm, wet, and suffocating days, then I was moved to the room that would be my home for the next seven weeks.\n\n\nA few days after moving to the new room, I was lying on my bed, feeling loopy from the morphine drip and thinking about drinking orange juice. The cup was just out of reach on my bedside table. I remember feeling a wave of injustice and anger come over me. Not about the accident, or my injuries, or being stuck in a hospital unable to work, possibly forever. No. I was angry about not being able to reach the orange juice. I was fucking furious at the orange juice. I was glaring at it, with everything I had, and then- BOOM! It exploded. Orange juice flying absolutely everywhere.\n\n\nThat was the first time I used my mind to blow something up. Honestly, it was exhilarating. I spent the next seven weeks popping gauze pads, glycerin swabs, any little thing that wouldn’t make too much of a mess.\n\n\nThe first person I looked up after I got out of the hospital was the driver of the silver Toyota. He was picked up for felony reckless driving, but let go on a technicality. I did some digging. I was a paralegal before my injuries forced me to take long-term disability so I knew my way around court documents. It also didn’t hurt that I was good friends with a few of the clerks at court. It turns out I wasn’t the first person he’d seriously hurt. His connections just kept finding him loopholes to skip through.\n\n\n\nI decided I should find him in person. Maybe this guy just looked bad on paper? Maybe he’d apologize? I was hoping for any redeeming quality. Nope. When I told him who I was he laughed and said, “were you this ugly before I hit you?” Then, he dropped to the floor, holding his head and screaming. He got what he deserved, a Subarachnoid Hemorrhage from an aneurysm exploding in his brain. Nasty things, those. So sad.\n\n\nThree days later, I let myself into my apartment only to find a man sitting at my dining room table. He was wearing an expensive looking suit and smoking a cigarette. He had obviously been there a while because smoke was swirling around him in a thick haze. I suppose I should have been shocked or terrified. The truth is I was expecting it.\n\n\n“Can I help you?”\n\n\nHe looked up from a mess of open folders and said, “Olivia, come here, I need you to take a look at this.”\n\n\nI blinked, hard, and then I walked over to the table.\n\n\n“Can I ask your name?”\n\n\n\n“Mr. W. Olivia, take a look at these pictures.” I looked over his shoulder at four open folders with pictures splayed out in piles. I can’t, no, I won’t, tell you what I saw the people in those pictures doing. Imagine for a moment the *worst* abuse to the most *innocent* of victims, and you might have a pretty good idea. \n\n\n“Olivia, What I have here is a four-way split video call. You’ll see that our agents have these four suspects in custody. Can you positively match the person on each screen to the pictures on the table in front of you?”\n\n\n\nI looked from the pictures to the screens one at a time. Carefully. There were three men and one woman. Each of the agents was wearing the same blue shirt and white pants Mora had worn.\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\nI haven’t mentioned my childhood, and I won’t go into detail about it. What I will say is that the woman on the screen bore a striking resemblance to my mother’s best friend, Marie. Same red hair, freckles, green eyes. Marie hurt me, just like the woman on the screen had hurt the child in the pictures spread across her file. The child who bore a striking resemblance to *me*: blonde hair, brown eyes, freckles. \n\n\n\n“Ok, Olivia. Please understand that these people have not been convicted of any crime. In fact, they aren’t being tried. These pictures were obtained illegally so they are not admissible in court. They are innocent until proven guilty. Do you understand?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n\nI looked back at the monitor and watched as each of them fell like marionettes being cut from their strings. One after the other, until all four were lying on the floor clutching their heads, screaming. \n\n\nMr. W looked up at me, his eyes squinting in a genuine smile. “Welcome to Moirai, Olivia. We are so happy to have you.\"\n\n\nThat was seven years ago. I’m 33 now, and I’m getting better every day. More precise. I’ve been practicing. Mr. W tells me that they will be needing me more than ever in the days to come. I’d ask you to wish me luck, but I don’t need it. I *have* been getting stronger every day. \n\nI’m strong enough now.\n\n\n\n[Alphabet Stew](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlphabetStew/)\n\n[OO](https://www.facebook.com/OnyxOctopus/)",

    "body": "So you’re interested in Asian skincare, but you don’t know where to begin.\n\n##The Philosophy \n\nThere is a lot of buzz around the concept of Asian skincare, and a lot of confusion. Most articles about it focus on the high number of possible steps that an Asian skincare routine can contain, which can be overwhelming for newcomers. \n\nThe Western skincare routine is comparatively simple. It boils down to cleanser and moisturizer. Some people use eye cream and some have a spot treatment. Serums are usually a splurge. Taken individually, each of these products can be great. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to solve all of your skin problems with just one cream and nearly impossible to develop and manufacture a cream to suit every possible combination of skin problems. What if you're struggling with acne and aging? What if you're aging but oily? What if you want to fade dark marks while hydrating very dry skin? Good luck finding a single product that tackles all of these problems while still being at a formulation that works for your skin. Some active ingredients need to be within a specific pH range to work. Others simply don't play well with each other.\n\nThis is where the Asian skincare routine comes in. You know all those toners and essences and serums and ampoules and emulsions you keep hearing about? They act as a vehicle of delivery for different active ingredients to target different issues or to reinforce the treatment of issues. You might have a toner or essence that brightens, with a serum that targets aging, and an emulsion and cream that address redness. The possibilities are endless. That's what makes Asian skincare so effective for so many of us!\n***\n##The Basic Steps\nWhen complete, your Asian skincare routine will be in this order, though you may not necessarily have every step:\n\n* Emulsifying oil cleanser\n* Foaming, milk, gel, powder, or soaping cleanser\n* Chemical exfoliator(s) and/or toner\n* Essence, serums and ampoules\n* Emulsion\n* Lotion\n* Cream\n* Facial oils\n* Sunscreen\n\n***\n##How to build an Asian skincare routine\nWhen it comes to building an Asian skincare routine, there are many different approaches you can take. You can wait until you run out of one of your current Western products, then look for an Asian replacement. The other, which I advocate, is to prioritize your product replacements based on two things: importance and rarity. First look for products that are important to skin health and for which it is difficult to find high quality equivalents in the mainstream Western market. The products below are arranged in that order. And while you're building your daily routine, try out some sheet masks! The instant gratification they offer can't be beat. This is why sheet masks are known as the Gateway Drug to Asian Skincare™.\n\n**Note: To prevent irritation and breakouts, remember to patch test every new product and give yourself 2 weeks to 1 month in between introducing each new product; otherwise you won’t know which product had which effect - positive or negative!**\n\n##Sunscreen\nWhen it comes to protecting  your skin from dark spots, signs of aging, and cancer, sunscreen is the most vital component of your routine. Unfortunately, the vast majority of Western drugstore sunscreens are unpleasant to use, especially at the ¼ Tsp dose that's recommended for full coverage. They tend to be heavy and greasy, with a strong white cast. The Asian market offers a huge selection of affordable, cosmetically elegant sunscreens with high UVA and UVB protection. Start here. For effective protection, look for a sunscreen with high SPF and PA Ratings: at least SPF 30 and PA+++ or higher.\n##Cleansing oil/makeup remover\nNow that you have a good sunscreen, you'll need an effective way to remove it at night, as well as to remove any other makeup you wear. The [double cleanse](http://snowwhiteandthepear.blogspot.com/2014/08/skincare-discovery-cleansing-part-i.html) is an integral part of many people's Asian skincare routine. The oil cleansing step breaks up and lifts off sunscreen and makeup so that your foaming cleanser can wash it away and get your skin nice and clean.\n##Essences, serums, and ampoules\nNow it's time for the really fun stuff! Essences, serums, and ampoules will be the primary vehicles for your skincare actives--the ingredients with specific, measurable effects against specific skin troubles--and thus the primary method by which you can customize your skincare routine. They are also where you can really start playing around with interesting ingredients that you won't find at the drugstore.\n\nEssences are usually a watery liquid. Serums and ampoules are thicker and contain more concentrated active ingredients. All types generally deliver some light hydration but are meant to sink in to the skin underneath moisturizing products.\n\n**Here are some popular ingredients and their functions:**\n\n* Vitamin C: Brightens, fades sunspots and age spots, repairs sun damage, increases collagen production over time.\n* Niacinimide: Brightens, fades sunspots and age spots, strengthens skin's moisture barrier\n* Snail secretion filtrate/snail mucin/snail goo: Alleviates redness, treats pimples, speeds healing, repairs sun damage, evens skin tone. [Source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23652894)\n* Arbutin: Brightens, fades sunspots and age spots by blocking the expression of melanin with long term use.\n* Yeast ferment extract/galactomyces/saccharomyces: Brightens, fades sunspots and age spots, evens skin tone, controls cell turnover and oiliness\n* Hyaluronic acid/Sodium hyaluronate: Hydrates by attracting and binding water within the skin\n* Glycerin: Hydrates by attracting and binding water within the skin\n* Salicylic acid: Chemical exfoliant (BHA) for the clearing of pores and treatment of acne; anti-inflammatory. Requires a pH between 3 and 4 to be effective.\n* Glycolic acid: (a type of AHA) Chemical exfoliant for the smoothing of skin's surface and treatment of acne; hydrating. Requires a pH between 3 and 4 to be effective.\n* Hydroquinone: Lightens dark spots. A controversial ingredient, hydroquinone--commonly associated with “skin bleaching” products--is rarely offered in over-the-counter products, except in extremely low concentrations, and you won’t encounter it much in popular Asian skincare lines. Hydroquinone works by inhibiting the activity of tyrosinase by acting as melanocyte cytotoxic inhibitor and by increasing the cytotoxicity of melanocytes.  Arbutin is a gentler and much more common cousin of hydroquinone. \n* Kojic Acid: Also lightens dark spots. Kojic acid lightens the skin by suppressing tyrosiase activity and is commonly used in topical formulations to treat dark spots. Kojic acid has a higher efficacy than arbutin in lightening the skin. (source: Skin Lightening and Depigmenting Agents : Article by Alaina James) \n* Mandelic acid (a type of AHA), a popular option for those who react poorly to the more common AHA options.\n* Starfish extract: Could starfish be the new snail? The preliminary research is promising, showing starfish’s anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, whitening, and wound healing potential. [Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2ilph5/move_over_snails_2014_is_the_year_of_the_starfish/) \n\nDon't feel constrained to use only one of each product type at a time. If you have multiple issues to treat, using multiple essences, serums, or ampoules is absolutely acceptable. Just remember to use any pH-dependent products first, and wait around 20-30 minutes before adding more products on top. And don't feel required to use all of these product types if you don't want to. An Asian skincare routine is only as elaborate as you want it to be!\n##Moisturizers\nThe Asian skincare routine offers several options for moisturization  and hydration. Emulsions are thin, liquid lotions that generally provide light hydration. They may be all that an oily skin type needs, while dry skin types often find them useful to add an extra boost under a heavier cream. Creams are thicker and generally more moisturizing. Sleeping packs and sleeping masks are heavier still and serve as the occlusive last step in a normal or dry skin type's nighttime routine. Facial oils can also be used as an occlusive last step, which is particularly helpful for very dry skin, and can also be blended with creams. As with essences, serums, and ampoules, all of these moisturizing options can include different actives to care for different skin problems. Also like essences, serums, and ampoules, you don’t need to use them all if you don't want or need to!\n##Toners\nIt can be difficult to find a Western equivalent to the Asian toner. In Western markets, toners are often astringent and meant to dry up oily skin types, which is usually a no-no in the nurturing Asian skincare philosophy. In contrast, Asian toners are typically hydrating, exist to remove residue, or lower the pH of skin after an alkaline cleanser so that it is more balanced and is ready for acids if you use them, and in general “arrange” the skin after cleansing so that it is ready to receive the optimal benefits from the products that follow. Some contain actives, while others focus on hydration by providing ingredients like hyaluronic acid. Look for one at a pH of 5.5 or below.\n##Other products: Foaming cleansers and chemical exfoliants\nWhen putting together an Asian beauty routine, I generally find it most practical to deal with products like foaming cleansers and chemical exfoliants last. This is because there are perfectly acceptable options for these available in the Western market. For cleansers, look for a [pH](http://snowwhiteandthepear.blogspot.com/2014/09/skincare-discovery-why-ph-of-your.html) around 4 to 5.5.  Our [cleanser pH spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-NtG1u1bp9h83YC2XDfa8Q-XgLB_b_kPi8c9sQW50co/edit#gid=0) can be a good starting point. For chemical exfoliants, look for a pH between 3 and 4. Some other products also have specific pH ranges where they work best, such as Vitamin C, which you can read about in more depth [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2h5n6b/the_more_you_know_vitamin_c_serum_faqs/).\nAnd that's about it! If you so choose, there are also a number of clay masks, face scrubs, and other special-occasion options to add in to your routine for an extra oomph.\n##A note on samples\nEveryone's skin is different, making building an Asian skincare routine a process of trial and error. You might think this makes the endeavor prohibitively expensive—and it would be, if you had to purchase full sizes of every product you want to test. Luckily, Korean skincare companies make samples very accessible. Online vendors like TesterKorea and RoseRoseShop sell sample sets and packs of sample sachets for a few dollars each and are often generous with samples when you make purchases. In addition, some people, like me, have built up large collections of samples over time and might just be willing to share them, if you ask nicely.\n***\n##Beginner FAQs\n\n**There are too many steps!  Do I have to start with a full routine to see benefits?**\n\nNo, as I mentioned above in **How to build an Asian skincare routine**, you can start slowly by replacing your western products with Asian ones as you empty them, although sunscreen (especially if you don’t have one or don’t like the one you have) is always a good starting point.\n\n**Snails and starfish?  Hell no, I’m noping right outta here.**\n\nThey’re popular for a reason, but there are many, many popular Asian products that have no \"unusual\" ingredients that you can’t also find in western products, although the Asian formulations are often better and at a lower price point.\n\n**I tried one of the cult products and it broke me out!**\n\nSadly, not everything works the same on everyone.  Many things you just need to explore for yourself, which is why patch testing and staggered introduction of new things is so important.  You can also look at the ingredients on [cosdna](http://cosdna.com/) to start narrowing down what ingredients don’t work for you, so you can avoid them in the future.\n\n**Ok I’m sold, I’m ready to buy X product on amazon/ebay.**  \n\nBeware of fakes.  You can review the Giant List of Sellers from the sidebar link [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/290to0/giant_list_of_websites_ebayers_etc/) for trusted sellers.\n\n**I keep seeing \"whitening\" everywhere- I don’t wanna bleach my face!**\n\nRest assured, whitening **usually** refers to \"brightening\" by fading areas darkened by damage.  It will not change your natural skin tone.\n\n**Show me the science!  Studies  and sources for everything,  or GTFO.**\n\nOne of the great things about the skincare market in Asia is that the consumers are highly discerning, have almost zero brand loyalty, and are always looking for “the next best thing.”  This creates a demand for fast and progressive Research & Development, so companies can release new products and woo customers away from other brands.  This means there’s always something new and exciting being researched, but peer-reviewed studies are a slow and methodical process.  Also, companies want to protect their intellectual property so data is not always immediately released.  There are preliminary studies out there such those linked earlier for snail mucin and starfish extract, which is exciting, but you’re not going to get the same “established proof over 20 years of study” like you are with western ingredients.  That’s part of the fun!\n\n**How do I choose  products?**\n\nWe can only give you pointers. Ultimately, the person who needs to do the research is you.  Figuring out your skin type and what concerns you have you want your routine to help with is a good first step.  You can get an indicator user flair [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2hb3k9/new_feature_update_indicator_flairs_now_available/) which will tell people what your skin type and troubles are, so they can make informed recommendations.  We also have many product resources on the sidebar, so you can look through them for people who have the same skin type and troubles as you.  Researching what works and doesn’t work for your “skin twins” is a great place to start!  \n\nIf you have already looked through the sidebar recommendations and you’re still lost, go ahead and ask your question in the ASK HERE! Daily Help and Questions thread located at the very top of the [/r/AsianBeauty front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/). Make sure to read the posting guidelines at the top of the thread before you post so you can include the kind of information we need to help you better!\n\n**Edit 7/27/16: What should I buy in my first haul???** We've talked a lot in this post about the different types of products to choose from, what they do, and things to take in mind as you begin to put together an AB skincare routine of your own. But it's also important to consider *how* you put together that AB skincare routine! Generally, picking and buying everything in one giant haul is a recipe for disaster, especially if you're fairly new to skincare. It takes time to learn your skin's sensitivities and preferences. For pointers on why your first haul should be a small one, and advice on which products that first haul should contain, please check out [this amazing post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4gltx6/newbies_why_your_first_haul_should_only_have_four/) of first haul tips!\n\nEnjoy your Asian skincare journey!",

    "body": "The same cosmetic chemist who posted the Q&A that I used as a starting point for [this post](https://reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/tysl3o/science_what_causes_sunscreen_to_sting_or_burn/) on what causes sunscreen to sting/burn your eyes was interviewed by a Japanese beauty magazine, VoCE. Ingredient analysis content is popular in Japan, too, and Ponkan reminds us that we can’t tell everything just by looking at ingredient lists. They still go by the alias Ponkan, which is a type of citrus and clearly not their real name.\n\nThe following is based on a rough translation of [the article](https://i-voce.jp/feed/2558078/)—**I cut out a few phrases/sentences and did a lot of paraphrasing**, so if you want to read what exactly they said, see the article I linked to (the whole thing is online, no paywall)—with supplementary content I looked up, but note that I’m just another skincare enthusiast with no relevant background. (I won’t really be able to answer questions because of this.)\n\n***Edit:** To provide further context, VoCE is basically like Allure (not that I’ve read Allure in ages) in that it’s meant for average consumers, not professionals involved in the beauty industry. Ponkan has simplified a lot of things and seems to be trying to prioritize getting the basic point across to average consumers, which is why I’ve chosen to prioritize (or tried to prioritize) readability over word-for-word accuracy.*\n\nFor content in English, Michelle from Lab Muffin talks about some similar things in part of this blog article: [Good Molecules’ “Nothing to Hide” Ingredient Lists: A Critique | Lab Muffin Beauty Science](https://labmuffin.com/good-molecules-nothing-to-hide-ingredient-lists-a-critique/)\n\nAdditional note right before I post this: It’s now 6 AM in Japan and I don’t know why I keep doing these so late at night/early in the morning. Let me know if I’ve messed anything up.\n\n___\n\n## Cosmetics are required to have full ingredient lists\n\n> **Ponkan:** Cosmetics made and sold in Japan are required to have full ingredient lists on their packaging, and ingredients that are in quantities over 1% must be listed in descending order. This rule was made so that consumers can use cosmetics safely. **Ingredient lists are meant for things like checking whether the product contains anything you’re allergic to, and not for determining whether the product is good or bad.**\n\nAccording to [the timeline](https://www.jcia.org/en/info/regulations) (in English) on the Japan Cosmetic Industry Association (JCIA) website, this rule was introduced in 2001. The main points given in section 5-2 of the *Cosmetic Ingredients Guide* (see Sources section below for publication details and the original Japanese) also say that colorants can be listed at the end of the ingredient list in any order; fragrance ingredients can be listed as “Fragrance”; and in the event that the product does not have the ingredient list printed on the packaging, they must be able to respond to inquiries directly from consumers.\n\nAn important thing to note is that while this rule is enforced by law for cosmetics, the same does not apply to quasi-drugs (and drugs), aside from certain ingredients that are required to be listed due to being known allergens. Cosmetics and quasi-drugs have entirely separate ingredient name systems, and not only is each ingredient defined differently, there are also stricter rules regarding things like impurities in the ingredients in the case of quasi-drugs. I think most (or a lot of) companies do list all of the ingredients for (according to section 5-3 in the same book) “medicated” cosmetics, hair growth products, “medicated” soaps, “medicated” bath salts, perm agents, and hair dyes, but this is voluntary and not required by law. But anyway.\n\n## You can’t tell whether a product is good or bad just from looking at the ingredient list\n\nPonkan originally posted a slightly simpler version of this table [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/cosmeresearch/status/1227192836413517827) (based on the analogy in [this mini-thread](https://twitter.com/aykh_/status/1222512916093530112) by another user), which I somehow thought went viral but I guess not quite:\n\n| **What affects the final product** | **Fried rice**                                               | **Cosmetics**                                                |\n| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Ingredients                        | Rice, cabbage, pork, eggs                                    | Water, glycerin, mineral oil, hyaluronic acid **(This is all you can tell from ingredient list analysis)** |\n| Quantities                         | 1/2 cup of rice, 1/4 of a cabbage head, 100 g of pork, 1 egg… | Glycerin 5%, mineral oil 1%…                                 |\n| Preparation                        | Shred cabbage, mince pork                                    | Purity of ingredients used, the order in which the ingredients are added in the manufacturing process |\n| Cooking method                     | Heat it in a microwave?

A chef from a three-star restaurant? | Outsourced or made in-house?                                 |\n| Aesthetics                         | How the dish is presented, the tableware used                | Packaging, fragrance, brand concept                          |\n\n> **Ponkan:** **All you can tell from ingredient lists is what’s literally in the product.** If you think of it like a recipe for cooking, all it is is the list of the ingredients that will be used, and it doesn’t give the ingredients’ quantities or cooking methods. Even if you use the same ingredients, things like how high you have the heat turned up on your stove or how you mix the ingredients are going to have an enormous effect on how the final dish turns out. **Cosmetics can also turn out to be completely different things depending on their formulation, or how they’re made. You can’t determine the quality of a product just by looking at the ingredient list.**\n\nRegarding quantities, there *are* companies like Chifure that also list each product’s percentage in the overall formulation, but Ponkan’s point still stands. (Personally, I appreciate all excessively detailed information just because I find it interesting, but see also Lab Muffin’s blog post that I linked to at the beginning.)\n\n## The same ingredients won’t necessarily have the same effects\n\n> **Ponkan:** Say you find a luxury product and a drugstore product that have very different price tags but share the same ingredients, according to their ingredient lists. To say that they must have the same effect is a bit of a stretch. **Did you know it’s possible to make products ranging from toners to creams using the same ingredients?** This is an example of **how much the quantities of the ingredients and the order in which they’re added, or the “formulation” of the product, matter** when you’re making cosmetics.\n\nRegarding luxury products and their more affordable “dupes,” I think another thing to consider is that the quality of the ingredients used might differ. Maybe this would make less of a difference than what Ponkan mentions here, but it could be another thing to consider. (And I say this as someone who only buys drugstore products.)\n\n[ETA: To continue with the fried rice analogy, are we using short-grain rice or long-grain rice? Where is this rice sourced and when was it harvested? The table above actually said “meat” but I translated it as “pork” because I feel like “meat” sounds kind of weird in English and might be slightly distracting, but what if it was supposed to be beef or chicken or something else? And if it’s pork, what grade of pork? Etc. etc. —This analogy really does work well]\n\n## Debunking common misconceptions\n\n### 1. High concentration = better for your skin?\n\n> **Ponkan:** It might seem like ingredients would be more effective at higher concentrations, which can be true in some cases, but there are also cases where the amount that really reaches your skin can vary by many times over depending on the other ingredients used (e.g., moisturizers, oils). There can be cases where more of a particular ingredient will absorb into your skin at 1% than at 5%. **It’s incorrect to assume that high concentrations are effective, or that low concentrations are ineffective.**\n\nThis blurb was a hair unclear to me at first—I get their point, but you really have to understand the whole thing to translate—but I think #4 also adds more insight regarding this.\n\n### 2. Adding a particular ingredient doesn’t automatically make it effective\n\n> **Ponkan:** For example, Niacinamide is reported to be less effective when combined with a particular moisturizing ingredient. **The same ingredient can be effective or ineffective depending on the formulation.** Again, things like the amounts used and the order in which they’re added really make a difference.\n\n### 3. Fragrance and texture are not just a matter of personal preference\n\n> **Ponkan:** Recent studies have shown that things like the fragrance and how the product feels on your skin can also affect your skin. **Fragrance is not just a matter of personal preference, but also an element directly connected to scientific evidence.** The way that you feel when using the product can also affect your skin. **It’s important that you have positive feelings about your skincare**, whether it’s that it feels good or that you feel like you’ll look better. Ideally, you would be using products with packaging, fragrances, brand concepts, etc. that you find acceptable as a whole, where you feel like it’s going to work for you.\n\nThis one is a total rush job because I was more interested in looking up which studies they’re talking about, lol. They mentioned these three by Kao, Pola, and Shiseido in [a related Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/cosmeresearch/status/1528738512870293504):\n\n- [Kao | Effects of Positive Emotions Induced by the Use of Skin Care Products Confirmed: Positive emotions contributed to improving skin appearance](https://www.kao.com/global/en/newsroom/news/release/2018/20181115-002/) – Published on November 15, 2018\n  - Original: [花王 | 快感情が肌の質感向上に影響を与える　スキンケアの効果を確認 (kao.com)](https://www.kao.com/jp/newsroom/news/release/2018/20181012-002/) – Published on October 12, 2018\n  - I found at least a couple of other related announcements. The search function doesn’t seem to work very well, but you can scroll through Kao’s R&D press releases in reverse chronological order [here](https://www.kao.com/global/en/newsroom/news/research-development-release/).\n- Noriko Suenobu, et al. 精油による表皮アセチルコリンエステラーゼ活性阻害と肌への直接効果 (The direct effects of essential oil by acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity in keratinocyte)\n  - Pola’s press release dated May 12, 2009: http://www.pola-rm.co.jp/pdf/release_2009_4.pdf (I couldn’t find an English version)\n  - Abstract from original presentation on March 26, 2009 at the 129th annual conference of The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan: http://nenkai.pharm.or.jp/129/pc/ipdfview.asp?i=1070 (27P-am050 項目コード：0208; also in Japanese only)\n  - Ponkan sums it up as: “Pola has announced that essential oils not only have a psychological effect, but may also directly contribute to strengthening your skin barrier”\n  - I was going to attempt to link to studies in English that seem to be talking about the same thing, but I think that might be beyond my skill set and will leave it up to someone better qualified.\n- Shinobu Nakanishi, et al. Effects of trans-2-nonenal and olfactory masking odorants on proliferation of human keratinocytes. *Biochem Biophys Res Commun*. 2021 Apr 9;548:1-6. doi: [10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.02.050](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.02.050). Epub 2021 Feb 22.\n  - Shiseido’s press release dated March 31, 2021: https://corp.shiseido.com/jp/news/detail.html?n=00000000003114 (I couldn’t find an English version, but the study is published in English anyway)\n\n### 4. Stop thinking of toners as just “90% water”\n\n(TL;DR: Water evaporates.)\n\n***Edit:** Ponkan provides diagrams to explain this part in the original article. I chose to write this out as text instead, but it’ll probably make more sense to read this alongside the diagrams in the original article.*\n\nLet’s say that there’s a toner and an emulsion with the same amount of moisturizing ingredients and active ingredients, with different amounts of water and also oils in the emulsion. (Ponkan emphasizes that these compositions aren’t representative of typical formulations, and they just wanted to simplify things to make this easy to understand.)\n\n- Toner: 10% moisturizing ingredients, 85% water, 5% active ingredients\n- Emulsion: 10% moisturizing ingredients, 15% oils, 70% water, 5% active ingredients\n\nOnce you’ve applied 100 mg of each product on your skin, the water will evaporate, leaving us with something like this. (Theoretically speaking here, we’re saying that 5 mg of the water is absorbed into the moisturizing ingredients, etc.)\n\n- Toner: 10 mg moisturizing ingredients, 5 mg water, 5 mg active ingredients\n- Emulsion: 10 mg moisturizing ingredients, 15 mg oils, 5 mg water, 5 mg active ingredients\n\nThis means that the toner is left with 5 mg out of 20 mg = 25% active ingredients, and the emulsion is left with 5 mg out of 35 mg = 14% active ingredients that are left to absorb into your skin. Ponkan stresses that this won’t always be the case for all products, of course, but this should show that you can’t always make assumptions based on what the initial numbers suggest.\n\n(This reminded me of [this thread](https://twitter.com/hikaricosme11/status/1638107746972352514) where another cosmetic chemist talks about how toners can be sensitizing, and although they also discuss other reasons, this is one of them. Anyway, I think this addresses the “toners are just water” thing very well.)\n\n> **Ponkan:** Some say that toners are 90% water so it doesn’t matter what you use, but this is wrong! **Because toners have high water content, much of it evaporates after applying it on your skin, which leaves you with a higher concentration of the active ingredients in the end.** It can even end up having a higher concentration than emulsions or creams, so **don’t just write them off as “mostly water” and be intentional about what you use.**\n\n## If we can’t judge a product by its ingredients, what should we base our decision on?\n\n> **Ponkan:** Ultimately it comes down to whether it’s compatible with your skin or not. You can’t tell whether a product is working or not after just a day or two—you’d have to use it for at least a few weeks for that—but you can tell what the fragrance and texture are like based on samples. I think it’s important to pick something you feel like you can use continuously based on samples, and to use the appropriate amounts and to follow the usage instructions for that particular product. And maybe another factor is whether the company that makes the product responds well to inquiries. This would show that the customer service and R&D departments have open lines of communication, which says a lot about the company’s approach to making their products.\n\n## Which products should we switch up?\n\n> **Ponkan:** The sunscreen, makeup primer, and face makeup categories seem to be evolving especially dramatically every year. There are constant innovations in formulation technology, too, so it seems like kind of a shame to keep using things from several years ago. You might be surprised by trying out the newest products available.\n\n___\n\nI also found these two related articles among the ones linked in the footer, which are based on interviews with Miyoji Okabe aka one of the co-authors of the book I cited earlier:\n\n- [成分が同じなら効果も同じ？原液は濃度が高い？【美容成分】の真実【美容成分ガイド】｜美容メディアVOCE（ヴォーチェ） (i-voce.jp)](https://i-voce.jp/feed/1819768/) – Published on August 20, 2022\n- [【成分が同じ＝効果も同じとは限らない！】コスメ選びに役立つ美容成分まとめ【美容成分ガイド】｜美容メディアVOCE（ヴォーチェ） (i-voce.jp)](https://i-voce.jp/feed/1833045/) – Published on August 21, 2022\n\nETA that the second article also makes the cooking analogy—with curry instead of fried rice—although I think what’s unique about Ponkan’s table is that they provide a full comparison side by side in that format.\n\n# (My) Sources\n\n- [成分だけで化粧品を選ぶのはもったいない！　化粧品処方のリアルを現役開発者が解説【美容成分ガイド】｜美容メディアVOCE（ヴォーチェ） (i-voce.jp)](https://i-voce.jp/feed/2558078/) – The article featuring Ponkan, published on May 17, 2023\n- Japan Cosmetic Industry Association (JCIA)\n  - [Regulations | 日本化粧品工業会 (jcia.org)](https://www.jcia.org/en/info/regulations) – Timeline of “Cosmetics /and Quasi-Drug Regulations Based on the Pharmaceutical Affairs Act,” accessed on May 20, 2023\n  - [化粧品の成分表示の趣旨説明 | 日本化粧品工業会 (jcia.org)](https://www.jcia.org/user/business/ingredients/cmtexplain) – More info in Japanese\n- Mitsuo Uyama, Miyoji Okabe, and Issei Hisamitsu, *Cosmetic Ingredients Guide* 7th edition (Tokyo: Fragrance Journal, 2020), [books.apple.com](https://books.apple.com/jp/book/化粧品成分ガイド-第7版/id1577300846?l=en).

[It is a milky white fluid](http://i.imgur.com/8LpVEEH.jpg) and works really well because it has glycerin in it which is an ingredient found in many primers. $10\n\nFoundation:\nI love the [Maybelline FitMe Matte and Poreless](http://i.imgur.com/xeNRE0E.jpg) in the [shade 228 Soft Tan.](http://i.imgur.com/Ab7rxsp.jpg) I typically sheer it down with lotion to make a light coverage every day but it has a medium buildable coverage as is. $5.50\n\nFor when I want a really full coverage, I use [Milani's Conceal and Perfect 2 in 1 Foundation](http://i.imgur.com/1vLKZmC.jpg) in the [shade 05 Warm Beige.](http://i.imgur.com/G8VsEpt.jpg) It is compared to Kat Von D's Lock-it Foundation but I personally believe that Kat's has an even higher coverage than Milani. $10\n\nConcealer:\nMy favorite cream concealer is [NYX Above and Beyond Full Coverage Concealer](http://i.imgur.com/AC7gzPW.jpg) in the [shade Medium.](http://i.imgur.com/X9MGFJq.jpg) I use it underneath foundation to cover any redness or discoloration. $5\n\nI use the cult favorite [Maybelline Age Rewind Dark Circle Concealer](http://i.imgur.com/FxoHxpW.jpg) in the [shade Neutralizer](http://i.imgur.com/o520R0t.jpg) as well as [NYX HD Concealer](http://i.imgur.com/UCL94LD.jpg) in the [shade 05 medium](http://i.imgur.com/AgInrFh.jpg) for my undereyes. The NYX has been said to be a dupe for NARS Creamy Radiant Concealer and Urban Decay's Naked Skin. I can't confirm that as I haven't tried them out myself. \nMaybelline: $6.50\nNYX: $7\n\nPowder:\nI use [Rimmel's Stay Matte Long Lasting Pressed Powder](http://i.imgur.com/duvEFdH.jpg) in the shade Creamy Beige to set my face. $4\n\nBrows: \nI have very full brows and I don't do much to them besides fill in a small bald spot in my left brow. I use [NYX Eyebrow Gel in Espresso](http://i.imgur.com/RnZGtO4.jpg) to do this. $10\n\nBlush:\nI don't really use blush but NYX and Milani have some really great ones.\n\nCheeks:\nI use [NYX HD Blush in Taupe](http://i.imgur.com/unSEXEE.jpg) to contour. It's very cool toned and works well on my skin but it could look ashy on other tones so be careful. $6.50\n\nI warm it up using the darker shade in the [Wet n Wild MegaGlo Contouring Palette in Caramel Toffee](http://i.imgur.com/qVVHsr9.jpg) and I use the lighter shade to set my under eye. Swatches [here.](http://i.imgur.com/63zZiWb.jpg) $5.50\n\nMy favorite highlighter is [ELF baked highlighter in Moonlight Pearls.](http://i.imgur.com/iMh8gNl.jpg) Several people have said it's not pigmented but there is a thin coating on top that you need to get through. I scratched off the very top layer using a safety pin and afterwards, the product becomes [very pigmented.](http://i.imgur.com/Wsn9wOM.jpg) It is also a dupe for Mary-Lou Manizer by The Balm. $3\n\nEyes:\n[ELF's Eyeshadow Primer](http://i.imgur.com/gC99kQw.jpg) has beaten out every high end eye primer I own so far and I love it. $1\n\nI have three palettes that I am so excited to talk about because they are all so so good. Swatches are two finger swipes with no primer\n1: Wet n Wild Studio Eyeshadow Palette in Coming in Latte\nSwatches [with flash](http://i.imgur.com/qp0MtqC.jpg) and [without.](http://i.imgur.com/d3DOU2f.jpg) $10\n\n2: Makeup Revolution Redemption Eyeshadow Palette in Iconic 2 \nThis is a shade for shade exact dupe of the Urban Decay Naked 2 Palette\nSwatches [with flash](http://i.imgur.com/9Kvx0EW.jpg) and [without.](http://i.imgur.com/SCYFwUl.jpg) $7\n\n3: Makeup Revolution Redemption Eyeshadow Palette in Iconic 3\nThis is a shade for shade exact dupe of the Urban Decay Naked 3 Palette\nSwatches [with flash](http://i.imgur.com/8ZlSCJA.jpg) and [without.](http://i.imgur.com/qCnP8ZA.jpg) $7\n\nMy favorite drugstore mascara is currently [Covergirl SuperSizer](http://i.imgur.com/NtUc0iS.jpg) but I am always on the hunt for the next best thing. I was silly and bought it in brown instead of black but I still love it. I just wish it were waterproof. $7\n\nI don't wear eyeliner so I don't have a favorite for that either.\n\nLips:\nMy favorite lipstick brands are Maybelline, Milani, ELF, and NYX. \nMy favorite red bullet is [Maybelline 800 Dynamite Red](http://i.imgur.com/wxmfhc6.jpg) from their Bolds collection. $7.50\nMy favorite nude bullet is [Milani 61 Matte Naked](http://i.imgur.com/eimRW0n.jpg) from their Matte collection. $4.50\nMy favorite pink bullet is [ELF Moisturizing lipstick in Ravishing Rose](http://i.imgur.com/xZ1LCFa.jpg) and is an exact shade dupe to Marc Jacobs lip crème in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. $3\nMy favorite liquid lipsticks are NYX Liquid Suede. $7 I like the shade [kitten heels](http://i.imgur.com/k02TbjG.jpg) which is a dupe for Jeffree Star's Red Rum and [soft spoken](http://i.imgur.com/BbXKwk1.jpg) which is a dupe for Kat Von D's Lolita. \n\nBrushes:\nI use the orange Real Techniques sponge for foundation and concealer. Everything else I own is by ELF, and below is a list of every brush I have, in no particular order.\n\nBeautifully Precise Powder Brush $12\nBeautifully Precise Smudge Brush $5\nUltimate Blending Brush $6\nContouring Brush $6\nKabuki Face Brush $6\nEyebrow Duo Brush $3\nCrease Brush $3\nBlending Brush $3\nSmall Tapered Brush $3\nFlawless Concealer Brush $3\nEyeshadow C Brush $3\nPowder Brush $4\nBlush Brush $3\nBlending Eye Brush $1\nEye Shadow Brush $1\nEye Crease Brush $1\n\nEdit: In the photo of myself at the beginning, I am wearing almost every one of these products with the exception of the lipstick and some added falsies.\n\nEdit 2: I forgot to mention above that in both of the MUR palettes, the first shade (the matte white/cream) are duds. They are hard to get into and you really have to get in there to get a good pigmentation. Every other shade including the other mattes are soft and buttery but for some reason that first one isn't. \n\nEdit 3: I didn't expect such a positive response to this. Thank you so much!",

It's silicone based but doesn't have the slippery silicone feel at all. The Maybelline one kinda blurs pores but doesn't fill them. It's more like the Smashbox primer if anything.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy other tiny nitpick is the Elf highlighter being like TheBalm Mary Lou. It's nowhere near as pigmented and its not the same yellow gold. I hated the Elf one tbh, it wasn't that pigmented even with the outer layer scraped off and it just sat on the skin funny.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOtherwise great list.

    "body": "So I suppose I will be the one to ask what I can only assume we (the competitive community) are all thinking. What is the vision for this game exactly? Changes like the Kwang \"quality of life\" change, TwinBlast's lock on auto attacks, and everyone having a passive cull the weak imply that Paragon is now catering to a casual playerbase over a competitive one. The feeling of accomplishment from practicing mechanics is being removed from the game in favor of a feeling of instant gratification.Where players who recently picked up the game can easily land autos/abilities/creep score. \n\nParagon seemingly adopted a philosophy of easy to play, easy to master at some point during legacy and it truly is a shame due to how much potential this game has. Recent metas reflect this as cards that require little to no skill to use (auras, posessed sprykin) have been the strongest in the game and a necessity on teams, compared to the few cards that require at least some skill to use (i.e. Glycerin Dawn.) This artificial shrinking of the skill gap between high and low tier players is extremely frustrating for anyone striving to play at the highest level, as players don't have much to work towards in terms of mechanics.\n\nI believe the feeling of finally mastering a difficult hero after weeks of effort is a rewarding one, it shows that a game has depth to it that cannot simply be mastered after a few weeks of playing. An example of a complex hero is Dota 2's Invoker, who feels great to play. Obviously not initially, but the feeling of wanting to improve, wanting to be able to make amazing and flashy plays is what attracts players to him. Paragon is completely void of any heroes with depth, the closest being Wukong with his two stances and four active abilities (which share cooldowns with the other stance, further limiting his depth as a hero.) That's not to say that I want this game to become a Dota or League clone, but it is wrong to ignore aspects of those games that make them as popular as they are simply because Paragon aims to be \"unique.\"\n\nThe two have many facets that need to be mastered in order to become a high tier player: the heroes are difficult and complex, rotations can be punished and as a result require more thought, laning is more interactive as a balance between cs and trading needs to be perfected by players. As one of the top Paragon players I feel I have the credibility to say Paragon is not a very deep game in its current state. It doesn't take very long to master each hero (heroes with more than a single skillshot are scarce), it doesn't take long to learn effective rotations, and it doesn't take long to learn to effectively play lanes (especially on Monolith.)\n\nIn conclusion it feels like with each patch Paragon takes another step in the wrong direction. Each patch lowers the skill ceiling and the gap between high and low skill players is artificially reduced, by no merit of either player. It's a worrying trend for myself and many of the players I interact with daily, and one that I could easily see myself leaving the game over in the near future. I feel the need to criticize Paragon as it's the game I've been enthralled with for the last 18 months and it would be a shame if it were to become so bland that I quit after all the time I have invested, but it's not the fresh, unique 3rd person MOBA I fell in love with in early 2016.\n\nEdit: Thank you to u/GeronimoJak for reformatting and making the post easier on the eyes.",

Why would Any of us comp players invest more time into a game where EPIC does not seem to care about our opinions nor do they care about the competitive scene. Not only that but they seem to strive to do the exact opposite of what we think is best for the longevity of the game.

They don't value their current fan base . When was the last time epic ever made a change based on fan feedback? How many threads will we make , how much fucking tears will we shed ,*don't be flattered epic, no one's crying for this shit game I was just trying to make this shit more appealing to read\n\nAnyways, there are two directions I want this game to take. , I would really like to see  paragon stay true to the moba genre and be built around reasonable fan feedback and grow to be one of the best mobas possible, or I will like to see epic continue on their path of doing whatever the fuck they want and watch the game burn and die slowly. \n\nI have over 77 days played on paragon so forgive me if I seem to fucking throw tantrums when these fucking clowns at epic games don't understand that you have to grow a fan base . Paragon will never be a one hit wonder like pubg ,there is no instant attraction to the game. \n\nAny new players to the game are reffered to by existing players,not the changes epic make to the game, yet epic rewards them with unwanted change. In Hopes of instantly being a big hit. The time for that is long gone. They refused to promote paragon.\n\nLying to the fucking fans saying they will promote the game when it's done. Guess what . The first week of fortnite battle Royale launch they paid alot of big twitch streamers like shroud  and Dr disrespect  to promote their game. The fortnite Reddit is filled with lots of posts praising epic for their swift updates based on fan feedback and support for the game.\n\nWhere is the love for the paragon community?

When you pull off your combo it feels amazing, when you whiff it and bounce a fleeing enemy away from your ult it feelsbadman. We need more heroes and cards that reward aim, timing and foresight not just stacking auras and diving into the fray. Have you put any thought into coordinating with other high level players and writing a petition/letter to epic? We need something like this to stop the game from becoming COD with minions.... Hell whats to stop epic from getting rid of minions and just upping the passive gold drip?",

        "body": "So I suppose I will be the one to ask what I can only assume we (the competitive community) are all thinking. What is the vision for this game exactly? Changes like the Kwang \"quality of life\" change, TwinBlast's lock on auto attacks, and everyone having a passive cull the weak imply that Paragon is now catering to a casual playerbase over a competitive one. The feeling of accomplishment from practicing mechanics is being removed from the game in favor of a feeling of instant gratification.\n\n Where players who recently picked up the game can easily land autos/abilities/creep score. Paragon seemingly adopted a philosophy of easy to play, easy to master at some point during legacy and it truly is a shame due to how much potential this game has. Recent metas reflect this as cards that require little to no skill to use (auras, posessed sprykin) have been the strongest in the game and a necessity on teams, compared to the few cards that require at least some skill to use (i.e. Glycerin Dawn.) This artificial shrinking of the skill gap between high and low tier players is extremely frustrating for anyone striving to play at the highest level, as players don't have much to work towards in terms of mechanics.\n\n I believe the feeling of finally mastering a difficult hero after weeks of effort is a rewarding one, it shows that a game has depth to it that cannot simply be mastered after a few weeks of playing. An example of a complex hero is Dota 2's Invoker, who feels great to play. Obviously not initially, but the feeling of wanting to improve, wanting to be able to make amazing and flashy plays is what attracts players to him. Paragon is completely void of any heroes with depth, the closest being Wukong with his two stances and four active abilities (which share cooldowns with the other stance, further limiting his depth as a hero.) That's not to say that I want this game to become a Dota or League clone, but it is wrong to ignore aspects of those games that make them as popular as they are simply because Paragon aims to be \"unique.\"\n\n   The two have many facets that need to be mastered in order to become a high tier player: the heroes are difficult and complex, rotations can be punished and as a result require more thought, laning is more interactive as a balance between cs and trading needs to be perfected by players. As one of the top Paragon players I feel I have the credibility to say Paragon is not a very deep game in its current state. It doesn't take very long to master each hero (heroes with more than a single skillshot are scarce), it doesn't take long to learn effective rotations, and it doesn't take long to learn to effectively play lanes (especially on Monolith.) \n\nIn conclusion it feels like with each patch Paragon takes another step in the wrong direction. Each patch lowers the skill ceiling and the gap between high and low skill players is artificially reduced, by no merit of either player. It's a worrying trend for myself and many of the players I interact with daily, and one that I could easily see myself leaving the game over in the near future. I feel the need to criticize Paragon as it's the game I've been enthralled with for the last 18 months and it would be a shame if it were to become so bland that I quit after all the time I have invested, but it's not the fresh, unique 3rd person MOBA I fell in love with in early 2016.\n\nFormatted for easy reading. <3 u nado.",

Characters need depth into them, you want the noob player to struggle a LOT during his first time playing a certain characters BUT enjoy playing it even thought he had difficulty, making him look over tutorial and guide to understand it better and practice on it. You want to go the \"Satisfying\" ways, not the \"gratification\" ways where you don't practice and instantly are good whereas you can practice and slowly see yourself improve while suffering to achieve a point where you became good, it brings more pleasure in the game to know that the characters you play is an hard one and that you managed to learn him. The example you gave Wukong is not a good example thought.. he really is not an example of a good characters. I much prefers Smite's Sun Wukong.\n\nBut we should NOT give noob the opportunity to be very good at their first time playing the game, they will have to become better. \n\nAnd yeah, i've said it but they're turning Lategame into the \"entire game\" they are progressively removing the laning phase (after phasing out the midgame, there are no midgame in Paragon at all). That's not how it work in a MOBA. Now, characters are good for the whole game or they're bad for the whole game : No characters good for early game that allows to be more agressive but that falls off lategame, only characters that are good early game to become extremely powerful lategame.",

I miss so many aspects of what legacy offered, some aspects that early monolith offered, but eh, what do I know...\n\nThe meta has been dominated by passive cards pretty much since v42 started, I'm unsure whether those passive cards are too strong or people got numbed on using active cards. I'm seeing very few people use cards like Blitzrush, Glycerin, Riposte, Stasis, Wetware, etc. and I can say that those cards are incredibly strong when used right, but it seems like passives shall run the day.\n\nEven \"semi-active\" passives like Amplification Engineer or Nukeblood Mutant seem to be neglected by the current community, maybe there aren't enough ability spam heroes in the meta, maybe there's better options, hell if I know anymore. Not to mention the lack of alternatives to cards like Plague Lord (for example old Thiccblood or Power Chord) doesn't help with the stagnation of the meta.\n\nLet's just hope there's more mechanics added to the game that raise the skill ceiling, as someone who challenged himself to actively play some of the hardest heroes possible in terms of mechanics (Serath, Shinbi, Countess) while maintaining off-meta builds (never used PSK or Atomic Soldier on any of those while building for full damage).\n\nMan, I miss the days when there were actual diminishing returns to builds, right now you can build full tank and still do so much damage since the base damages are through the roof. So many mistakes done, but so little time to compile them in a single post...\n\nMay we be in peace. -- your friendly revelator",

Look at the direction every patch in recent memory has taken. It's impossible to make a MECHANICALLY challenging game that is competitive across both console (PS4) and PC; you just can't balance for both due to the limitations of a controller. I think we'll all look back at some point (maybe a year from now, two years, or maybe even less), and we'll be mad at ourselves for not just accepting the signs that were right in front of us all along. They are not concerned with making this a competitive MOBA...That would require them to cater to the PC audience, which is much smaller than their PS4 audience. I'm with you, EPIC needs to \"man-up\" and tell us the truth about their direction for the game, but they won't do that. At best, they'll give a generic response about *wanting* the game to be competitive. So ultimately it's up to us, as competitive players, to recognize the hints and signs they have given us. I still enjoy the game, so I will continue to play it \"competitively\", but I don't have any kind of expectations for this game to become the next big eSport.",

However, the Zoom Fly 6 being a banger has given me hope that things are turning around with their other offerings. I walked into my local store a couple days ago and was surprised to see they had these in stock about a week early. Trying them on, they really felt great so I was out $150(great job by Nike to lower the price from the 17).\n\nUpper wise, these are very plush, and wider than usual for a typical Nike fit. I think it will be accommodating for more than the usual runners that pick Nike. It’s not the most breathable upper and could be quite hot in summer but that’s the tradeoff for all this padding.\n\nMidsole is the star of the show. It’s 46mm of stack, and this feels like a max stack shoe for the first time. The Vomero 17 was a nice cruiser but feels almost minimalist compared to this. The midsole feels like it is about half ZoomX with a ReactX base for stability and durability. The ride is lovely, smooth, comfortable, and helps you to not notice the weight as much. There is a really nice rocker geometry up front that keeps it rolling along. Speaking of weight, it is competitive with the Glycerin Max and Bondi 9, both of which it is in a similar class to. These are cruisers, not meant for speed but comfort, and they deliver that in spades.\n\nOutsole is very tacky, and actually has some nice flex grooves to give the midsole some flex despite such a high stack. I really think this is a great option for recovery days or long easy runs, especially undercutting Hoka by $20 on the Bondi 9 or Brooks by $50 on the Glycerin Max. Feel free to ask questions!",

    "body": "First, I want to make it clear that **I’m not a qualified expert in any way.** I don’t have a background in cosmetic chemistry or dermatology, or even chemistry or biology in general. I’m just a consumer who cares a little too much about sunscreen because I have a sun allergy. This has been sitting in my drafts for a couple of weeks because I feel insecure about publishing this when I’m sure many of you will understand all this much better than I can. I’m also not affiliated with Allie or Kanebo or Kao or even the beauty industry at large in any way. Any corrections will be very welcome and appreciated.\n\nMany of the links aren’t in English, so I’ll indicate the language unless I think it’s obvious: ^(J) = Japanese, ^(E) = English, ^(TC) = Traditional Chinese, ^(SC) = Simplified Chinese (I’m sorry if I get Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese mixed up). Also, ^(PDF) = PDF.\n\n**[TL;DR](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gyexf58/)** / **[Additional information](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gyhq3fu)**\n\n# About Allie sunscreens\n\n**Allie Extra UV Gel N** ([brand website](https://www.kanebo-cosmetics.jp/allie/),^(J) [official product details](https://www.kanebo-cosmetics.co.jp/products/2027879),^(J) [RatzillaCosme](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-gel-n-2020/)^(E)) is an SPF 50+ PA++++ gel sunscreen for the face and body from the Japanese company [Kanebo Cosmetics](https://www.kanebo.com),^(E) which is part of the global [Kao Group](https://www.kao.com/global/en/).^(E) Kao as a cosmetics and chemical company is behind [many brands](https://www.kao.com/jp/products/) including Bioré, Curél, and Nivea Japan. Kanebo’s [brands](https://www.kanebo-cosmetics.co.jp/products/brand) include, well, Kanebo, as well as Allie, Kate, and Suisai.\n\nThe Allie brand also has a [Facial Gel](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-facial-gel-n-2020/)^(E) that’s specifically meant for the face, a [milk](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-perfect-n-2020/)^(E) that’s also for the face and body, and a few tone-up/color-correcting gels, all of which are rated SPF 50+ PA++++. (And a few water resistant makeup products that I admittedly tend to forget about.) They’re currently marketing their color-correcting sunscreens, [Allie Color Tuning UV](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-color-tuning-uv/),^(E) quite heavily as a foundation alternative that also provides UV protection. Aside from the Color Tuning line, which was released on February 16, 2021, all of the current sunscreens were released on February 16, 2020 (2020 formula). The previous version of the Allie gel, [Allie Extra UV Gel](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-gel-spf50/)^(E) (without the “N”), was released on February 16, 2018 (2018 formula), and all the presently discontinued formulations released in 2018 and 2019 were also rated SPF 50+ PA++++.\n\nI’ve been using the Allie gel for nearly a decade now, starting with [the second formulation](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-gel-mineral-moist-n/)^(E) released in 2012. [This 2013 article](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/japan-pa-system-for-uva-protection-revised/) from RatzillaCosme reminded me that I picked it up in the first place because it was one of the first sunscreens to be labelled PA++++. I do still try out other sunscreens from time to time, but I always have a tube of the Allie gel open concurrently with anything else I use. I’ve posted about the difference between the 2018 and 2020 formulas [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/gkgwm8/sunscreen_kanebo_allie_februaryapril_2020_new/), and reviews of each version [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/bz8r9t/japanese_sunscreens_allie_extra_uv_gel_highlight/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/jmkjlk/japanese_sunscreens_pt_2_allie_extra_uv_gel_n/), with an update to the 2020 review coming up.\n\n# On testing and reformulations\n\nAfter learning about the loophole in Korean law through [Odile Monod’s video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC8r3S0i0Ro) (via u/bloominglace’s [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mvajyp/korean_sunscreen_controversy_industry/)) and [Instagram Highlights](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3OTA0MjgzMTIwODUyNTQ4?story_media_id=2553999541407826596_1588058418) (via u/FrenchbunnyG’s [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mvajyp/korean_sunscreen_controversy_industry/gvbbsmz) in the same post), I tried to find information about the laws surrounding SPF/PA testing for reformulated products in Japan (because I live in Japan and therefore use Japanese sunscreens) but kept getting a bunch of hits about testing methods in general, and gave up trying to sift through it all.\n\nThe only product I personally really care about is the Allie gel, so I wrote to Kanebo directly and asked whether they test their reformulated products individually, with the 2018 and 2020 formulas of the Allie gel as an example, or whether their test results are carried over across formulations. Their response as of April 26, 2021 is that they test each version separately (“SPF/PA値の測定に関しまして、それぞれ測定しております”).\n\nI don’t know whether the same goes for all companies in Japan or not, or even for all Kao/Kanebo brands, but that’s one less thing for Allie users to worry about.\n\n*—And after leaving this sitting in my drafts for a couple of weeks, I am adding that* u/ysy_heart *has posted* [*this*](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/n8afq7/discussiondirector_of_japan_cosmetic_industry/) *about what the director of Japan Cosmetic Industry Association said about what their guidelines are on this subject.*\n\n# Hong Kong Consumer Council (October 2020)\n\nIn [the October 2020 report by the Hong Kong Consumer Council](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/jj0n81/sun_care_test_report_of_30_sunscreen_products/)^(E/TC) that everyone keeps referring to, the 2018 formula of the Allie gel (as seen in [the photo](https://imgur.com/seDmooL) published with the report) was rated SPF 61.7 PPD 9.8 (PA+++).\n\n*I’ll post a simplified version of [the results table](https://imgur.com/fPhhBUm)^(E/TC) in the comments, mostly for my own convenience. Pay attention to the countries where they were manufactured, because it won’t always be what you would expect based on the brand name alone (e.g., the Skin Aqua sunscreen they tested is not the version sold in Japan).*\n\nThis report has however been [strongly disputed](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/industry-backlash-against-hong-kong-055209520.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAK4TL438S1-PdoMMNuPEgQDoqSsnxGnrdJkx3KD1AFFKhT954eT6y5wqfPHlPNFMeiTWZ-lR6QpiWq3MZrp6PHVo_bdAglpeqsFmR8XtBe5pnnk4BJt4fd153Auf6s1hr1H2AEnr-eQiw-Q7kFDoSSSO7LigiM7a2-yDLpXE0fxK)^(E) (bold added by me):\n\n>Pharmacology professors also warned that **variations in testing meant some results were not conclusive and flagged as an issue the sampling of Australians for a product designed for Asians**.  \n>\n>\\[…\\]  \n>\n>**The Consumer Council outsourced the checks to laboratory company Eurofins in Australia which tested the PA factor in vitro rather than on human skin.**  \n>\n>The products were analysed under a European Union framework as the city currently does not have regulatory standards in place for measuring SPF and PA effectiveness.  \n>\n>The testing recorded the efficacy of Fancl’s Sunguard 50+ Protect UV sunscreen as SPF 14.3 and PA++, but reports from the United States and China, which both tested on human skin, reported an SPF of above 50 and PA++++.  \n>\n>\\[…\\]  \n>\n>“Although the Consumer Council test was conducted in 2020, they’re using the methods from 2010,” \\[Michelle Ma Chan Mok-lan, co-founder and executive director of Fantastic Natural Cosmetics Limited, the sole distributor of Fancl products in Asia excluding Japan\\] said at a press conference on Wednesday ahead of the watchdog’s publication of results.  \n>\n>\\[…\\]  \n>\n>The International Organisation for Standardisation updated its methods relating to sunscreens in 2019 which recommended testing the SPF level on human skin.  \n>\n>\\[…\\]  \n>\n>Henry Tong Hoi-yee, honorary associate professor at the University of Hong Kong’s department of pharmacology and pharmacy, said that **results reported from a single test should not be deemed conclusive as laboratories varied in their methodology and sample testing, often leading to large disparities**, citing three international scientific papers.  \n>\n>“Personally, I think a re-test \\[of the product\\] is needed in order to determine the reason for the large disparity,” Tong said.  \n>\n>He added that **the Eurofins laboratory results might not be entirely incorrect as it was a reputable institution, but its methods were not holistic enough**.  \n>\n>Professor Bernard Cheung Man-yung, from HKU’s department of medicine and president of the Hong Kong Pharmacology Society, said **the Eurofins report unfairly ran the tests on an Australian audience based on European standards**, rather than relying on a local sample, given **the products tested by the Consumer Council were formulated for Asian skin**.  \n>\n>Cheung said consumers should not rely on sunscreen alone to protect themselves against harsh rays, advising the public to wear light long-sleeved clothing and to shield themselves with a hat or umbrella when exposed to sunlight for long periods of time.\n\n*Excerpted from Kathleen Magramo, “*[*Industry backlash against Hong Kong Consumer Council study which finds 83 per cent of sunscreen products do not meet protective claims*](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/industry-backlash-against-hong-kong-055209520.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAK4TL438S1-PdoMMNuPEgQDoqSsnxGnrdJkx3KD1AFFKhT954eT6y5wqfPHlPNFMeiTWZ-lR6QpiWq3MZrp6PHVo_bdAglpeqsFmR8XtBe5pnnk4BJt4fd153Auf6s1hr1H2AEnr-eQiw-Q7kFDoSSSO7LigiM7a2-yDLpXE0fxK)*,”* South China Morning Post*, October 14, 2020.*\n\n**SPF testing:** According to both [the SPF Testing factsheet](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601368/spf-testing.pdf)^(PDF) and [the ISO Protocol factsheet](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601367/spf-iso-protocol.pdf)^(PDF) that Eurofins links to from [this page](https://www.eurofins.com.au/dermatest/sunscreen-testing/spf-tests-and-related/) on their Australian website, their SPF tests are performed according to the [ISO 24444:2010](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24444:ed-1:v1:en)^(E) protocol, which they claim is accepted in Japan (p. 1 on the second PDF; Japan is listed twice, even). However, the current standard for SPF testing in Japan is [ISO 24444:2019](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24444:ed-2:v1:en),^(E) effective as of February 21, 2020 according to [this notice](https://www.jcia.org/user/common/download/business/guideline/spf/SPF-jcia-r020221.pdf)^(J) (linked from [this page](https://www.jcia.org/user/business/guideline/spf)^(J)) issued by the [Japan Cosmetic Industry Association](https://www.jcia.org/en/)^(E) (JCIA)—or maybe it was also accepted before then? JCIA isn’t a government organization, by the way, so I don’t think they can actually enforce anything, but they seem to be in charge of setting industry-wide guidelines and work directly with the government in some capacity. Anyway, the same notice states that ISO 24444:2019 was issued in December 2019. The major changes between the 2010 and 2019 versions are listed in the Foreword of ISO 24444:2019:\n\n>— The definition of the minimal erythema response (MED) criteria has been revised.  \n>\n>— The choice of eligible test subjects is now based solely on individual typology angle (ITA°) with a requirement for the average ITA° for the test panel to be within the range 41° to 55°, with a minimum of three subjects within two of the three ITA° ranges.  \n>\n>— The ITA° is used to define the range of unprotected MED doses for the provisional or the test day unprotected MED determination (if no provisional MEDu determination is made).  \n>\n>— Three new reference standard sunscreens have been validated and added to the method to validate SPF test panels for products with SPF equal to 25 or higher (P5, P6 and P8).  \n>\n>— New test methods are provided to determine the uniformity of the beam of both large and small beam size solar simulators. A requirement for uniformity greater than or equal to 90 % has been added.  \n>\n>— Sunscreen application procedures have been described in greater detail.  \n>\n>— An informative Annex F has been added with photographic examples of erythema responses with guidelines for grading.  \n>\n>— The reporting tables in Annex G) and the requirements in Clause 11 have modified to provide more complete information on the results of the testing.  \n>\n>— The bibliography has been updated.\n\nThe notice from JCIA also lists most of these changes, with a few additional details. They point out for example that the Fitzpatrick skin type is being phased out as criteria for test subjects in favor of individual typology angle (ITA°), which will be relevant later in this post.\n\n*If you have no idea what an “individual typology angle” is (like me), it’s strictly based on skin color and seems much less open to interpretation than the Fitzpatrick skin type criteria. I found* [*this 2013 review article*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/bjd.12529)*^(PDF)* *in the* British Journal of Dermatology *really informative, though I admittedly have only skimmed through it very quickly.*\n\nIt’s possible that Eurofins just hasn’t updated their website, but I think this is what Michelle Ma Chan Mok-lan (Fancl) is talking about in the quote above about the HKCC report using testing methods from 2010. [Fancl Sunguard 50+ Protect UV](https://www.fancl-hk.com/product_details.asp?item_id=5685),^(TC) their product in the report (rated SPF 50+ PA++++ and tested at SPF 14.3 PPD 6.8 or PA++), was apparently released in [2018](https://www.cosme.net/product/product_id/10153767/top)^(J) in Japan, but according to the *South China Morning Post* article, “\\[Ma Chan\\] said that its product went through two rounds of testing by Cantor Research Laboratories in the United States in 2019 and the Chongqing Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital in China in 2017.” (Fancl also seems to point out that their product needs to be shaken before use in [this article](https://beauty.ulifestyle.com.hk/beauty/skincare/20099/fancl防曬-對消委會測試報告表示失望-強調產品完全符合標示-消委會就事件最新回應),^(TC) which could indeed potentially be something that affected the test results. I feel like it’s common knowledge among anyone that’s familiar with milk sunscreens at all, though, and I would hope that any lab conducting these tests would be aware of this. They also seem to say in the same article that any sunscreens that had extremely different test results should be re-tested in more than one lab, which is fair. But keep in mind that I’m reading a machine-translated version of the article for these observations.)\n\nI’m going to ignore the test run in China in 2017 because I believe it would have been following the so-called outdated testing methods, or ISO 24444:2010 (see the section titled “The Chinese version” below). [Cantor Research Laboratories](http://www.cantorlabs.com) basically just has their contact information on the website, so I can’t tell whether they would have conducted their test according to ISO 24444:2019, which would have been possible if the test took place in December. Cantor Research Laboratories was composed of 15 employees and specialized in anti-aging claims [as of 2016](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cen-09419-cover). *(They apparently do testing for Amway, a major MLM company, by the way; try googling* `\"Cantor Research Laboratories\" Amway study`*. —No, I don’t know whether that actally means anything, it’s just something I noticed.)* Eurofins Scientific on the other hand is composed of approximately 50,000 employees in 800 laboratories in 50 countries ([source](https://www.eurofins.com)), though I don’t have numbers for the Australian location specifically. I don’t know whether larger labs would necessarily produce more accurate results, but I would assume they generally wouldn’t be likely to be *less* accurate (or am I completely mistaken?). Interestingly, Dermatest, an Australian lab that was acquired by Eurofins ([source](https://dermatest.com.au)), lists Cantor Research Laboratories among their “Scientific Associates” on [their Links page](https://dermatest.com.au/information/links/). They also cite Cantor Research Laboratories’ Operating Procedure Manual on what appears to be another one of their factsheets, “No. 28 Antiperspirant Efficacy,” published on p. 12 of the February 2017 issue of *The Science of Beauty* (vol. 6 no. 7; [PDF](https://ascc.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SOB-Feb2017.pdf)). On Eurofins’ Australian website, they instruct that samples should be sent to “Eurofins Dermatest,” located at the same address on the Dermatest website ([example](https://www.eurofins.com.au/dermatest/sunscreen-testing/spf-tests-and-related/)), so I’m pretty sure we can think of them as the same entity. Clearly they know of Cantor Research Laboratories, and I wonder what they would say about the discrepancy.\n\nReturning to the *South China Morning Post* article, I assume that “the sampling of Australians for a product designed for Asians” is in reference to SPF testing, not PA testing, since the latter was *in vitro*. According to Eurofins’ [SPF Testing factsheet](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601368/spf-testing.pdf),^(PDF) their test subjects “consisted of fair skin individuals with Fitzpatrick skin types I, II or III” (p. 3). As mentioned above, ISO 24444:2019 no longer uses Fitzpatrick skin types as criteria for test subjects, so I think we can establish that the SPF results in the report cannot be compared directly with any SPF ratings based on ISO 24444:2019. There are however multiple sunscreens that were released before 2020 and would have been based on ISO 24444:2010.\n\nSo referring back to ISO 24444:2010, according to [this PDF from some time before 2013](https://www.tes-h.co.jp/documents/SPFPFA.pdf)^(J)—but I’m not sure whether it’s after 2010—Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, and III were part of the criteria for SPF test subjects (and types II, III, and IV for UVAPF). This would definitely be before 2010, but [this paper](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/sccj1979/26/3/26_3_207/_article/-char/ja/)^(E/J) published by JCIA in 1992 also specifies Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, and III for SPF testing. As discussed below, the same goes for China as of 2015. So it seems like the Eurofins test subjects and test subjects in Japan and China (before ISO 24444:2019) would have the same Fitzpatrick Skin types, but Dr. Dray suggests in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGwjKOHq02w) (“Can we trust sunscreen? Korean SPF controversies,” April 30, 2021) that test subjects in different regions are likely to be skewed toward different skin tones. This is just speculation, but maybe it’s possible that more of the test subjects in Japan and China could have been types II and III, for instance, and more of the test subjects for the HKCC report could have been types I and II. (I’m guessing that this is what Professor Cheung means when he says that “the Eurofins report unfairly ran the tests on an Australian audience \\[…\\] given the products tested by the Consumer Council were formulated for Asian skin.”) In that case, while we absolutely couldn’t say that the ratings for Asian sunscreens are “incorrect” or that the companies are “lying” based on the HKCC report, perhaps the report’s SPF ratings could possibly be pertinent if you have type I skin. But again, this is entirely speculative.\n\n**PA testing:** The Australian Eurofins website seems to confirm that their UVA tests are performed *in vitro*. I’m assuming they follow the [ISO 24443:2012](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24443:ed-1:v1:en)^(E) protocol (*in vitro*), since they have [a factsheet](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601373/iso-24443-in-vitro-uvapf.pdf)^(PDF) for that too, linked from [this page](https://www.eurofins.com.au/dermatest/sunscreen-testing/spf-tests-and-related/uva-tests/) on UVAPF testing. (ISO 24443:2012 is also mentioned at the bottom of [the report’s results table](https://imgur.com/fPhhBUm)^(TC) in footnotes 4 and 5, but I gave up on trying to figure out what it actually says.) In Japan, however, UVAPF testing is performed according to the [ISO 24442:2011](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24442:ed-1:v1:en)^(E) protocol (*in vivo*). Eurofins themselves state in this factsheet that both the Japanese and Korean markets require *in vivo* testing, which they also point out is much more expensive than *in vitro* testing (p. 1). They also state that UVAPF ratings determined by these tests are considered **estimates** of Boots Star, FDA Broad Spectrum,\\* and JCIA UVAPF (= what most of us know as PA) ratings (p. 2).\n\n*\\* The FDA website says in vitro testing is accepted in accordance with* [*21 CFR 201.327(j)*](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=b97fda59bb83d2742a276a215cdc115e&mc=true&node=se21.4.201_1327&rgn=div8)*, which I didn’t have the energy to actually read and am assuming is the same thing as Eurofins’ factsheet on* [*FDA Broad Spectrum Testing*](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601376/fda-broad-spectrum.pdf).*^(PDF)* *They say it’s based on ISO 24443:2012 but with “differing film thickness and pre-irradiation requirements” (p. 1).*\n\nIf the UVAPF testing for the HKCC report was indeed in accordance with ISO 24443:2012, I wouldn’t discredit the results entirely—but again, I’m not an expert. While we can’t say that the ratings for Asian sunscreens are “incorrect” or that the companies are “lying” based on the HKCC report (same as the SPF ratings), it seems to me that the PPD ratings they give in the report could potentially be used to make comparisons with sunscreens from other countries where UVAPF ratings are also determined in accordance with the *in vitro* ISO 24443:2012 protocol, or at least with other results within the same report (though we would still have to keep in mind that “results reported from a single test should not be deemed conclusive”). Eurofins’ own factsheet suggests that ISO 24443:2012 is accepted in Australia, New Zealand, and the EU, but I haven’t done any research to back this up, and we have already seen that their factsheets might be outdated.\n\nThe next versions of [ISO 24442](https://www.iso.org/standard/75496.html)^(E) and [ISO 24443](https://www.iso.org/standard/75059.html)^(E) are about 40% through their respective development processes, by the way, so that’s something to keep an eye on if you’re looking into this stuff.\n\n**EDIT:** u/lovethewayyoulick has posted [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gycvnq4/) about the formulation of Allie sunscreens, specifically regarding Kao/Kanebo’s proprietary “[ADVAN Technology](https://www.kao.com/jp/skincare/surface/surface-02/),\" the name ADVAN coming from “Anti-Damaging uV-A Network.” In a nutshell, their sunscreens are designed to work with sebum to provide higher UVA protection, which would not be reproducible with standard *in vitro* testing. It also seems to explain why Allie sunscreens don't always do too well in casual experiments using light-sensitive materials (as I discuss in the section I had to delete for length posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gyc9sqv/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). I’m now also thinking of other Japanese sunscreens that claim to work with different factors to increase their protection. Shiseido’s [Anessa](http://anessa.shiseido.co.jp/about/) sunscreens, for instance, advertise their “Thermo-Booster Technology” to work with heat and “Aqua-Booster Technology” to work with sweat and water. These product-specific factors may not necessarily be taken into account in third party testing.\n\n**Other possible issues:** Even after looking into all this (without actually reading all the publicly available details in each ISO… sorry, that’s beyond my mental capacity right now), I still don’t know whether the difference between the testing methods would really explain the larger disparities in the SPF results, like the Fancl sunscreen. I’ve seen some of you make a very good point that how old the bottle used for the test is (and I would assume things like storage conditions; last summer was a particularly hot one, and some supplements I ordered from the US arrived practically melted together in the bottle) or even the specific batch could potentially affect test results, too.\n\nFor more information about the actual testing methods, see [\\[Discussion\\]How SPF and PA are measured in Japan](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mqysux/discussionhow_spf_and_pa_are_measured_in_japan/) by u/ysy_heart. (I want to note that the SPF testing methods described here are based on ISO 24444:2010 and have technically been phased out, but it seems general enough to be at least mostly applicable for ISO 24444:2019, too.)\n\n*—Phew, that was long! I keep seeing this report being mentioned, so I wanted to try my best to do my due diligence. I don’t have a background in science, though, and it’s my first time even actually looking at ISOs, so I’m sorry if I’m completely off.*\n\n# National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan (May 2020)\n\nIn another [report by the National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mx54m7/discussionthirdparty_testing_on_27_japanese/)^(E) published in May 2020, either the 2018 formula or the 2020 formula of the Allie gel (unclear) was confirmed to be SPF 50+ PA++++ in two out of two tests using a spectrophotometer, though I’m honestly skeptical of the general accuracy of these tests, seeing how four sunscreens claiming to be SPF 30–35 tested consistently at SPF 50+. I guess Japanese companies *could* plausibly be motivated to label their products with lower ratings than what they actually are, since many consumers here believe that high-SPF products are rough on your skin and can actively seek lower-SPF products for daily use, but as an amateur, it seems like it would be easier to actually make a low-SPF product if that’s what you want to sell.\n\nAgain, these tests were performed with an *entirely* different method, and I imagine their results can only be used to draw comparisons with other results in this same report, if anything at all. (For more information on the testing method, see u/ysy_heart’s research and thoughts in the link for the report.)  If there’s so much hubbub about the testing methods in the HKCC report, I’m sure testing with a spectrophotometer would be even further off. I want to give the NCACJ credit for at least running each test twice instead of just doing it once and being done with it, but I also don’t know whether running the spectrophotometer tests even a hundred times would necessarily be credible.\n\nAlso, although the HKCC report seems to have product name errors too (I’ll cut them some slack because they’re dealing with products from other countries, and the photo helps with product identification), I can definitively say that the report the NCACJ published has [some mistakes and ambiguities](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mx54m7/discussionthirdparty_testing_on_27_japanese/gvsj5eh).^(E) This doesn’t necessarily mean that the tests themselves are equally faulty, but it does make me wary of any other potential mistakes in printing the test results.\n\n# The Chinese version\n\nThe Allie gel is also rated SPF 50+ PA++++ [in China](https://allie.cn)^(SC) (and SPF 45 PA++++ after being immersed in water according to [their official TMall page](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?spm=a212k0.12153887.0.0.1a67687dAgrr3k&id=596686898582),^(SC) if I’m interpreting “浴后防晒指数” correctly), where they require testing at National Medical Product Administration (NMPA) accredited labs in China, as well as additional *in vivo* testing ([source](https://www.cosmeticsdesign-asia.com/Article/2019/08/19/Sunscreen-regulations-in-the-world-from-European-Union-USA-Canada-to-China)^(E)). The NMPA-approved testing methods seem to be detailed in [this 11 MB PDF](https://www.nmpa.gov.cn/directory/web/nmpa/images/MjAxNcTqtdoyNji6xbmruOa4vbz+LnBkZg==.pdf)^(SC) of their Safety and Technical Standards for Cosmetics (2015), SPF testing from p. 546 and PA or PFA testing from p. 554. I’ve given up on trying to decipher everything, but it appears that their SPF testing either follows or is based on ISO 24444:2010 (so it might have been updated by now), using test subjects with Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, and III, and their PA testing either follows or is based on ISO 24442:2011, using test subjects with Fitzpatrick skin types III and IV.\n\nInitially I was satisfied in thinking of this as another separate test performed on the Allie gel, but then it occurred to me that I don’t know whether the Chinese version has the same formulation as the Japanese version or not, though I assume they would at least be very similar. [Based on the packaging](https://imgur.com/a/WbH2gAS),^(E) I’m guessing that the current version there is basically equivalent to Allie Extra UV Gel (the 2018 formula in Japan). [This page](https://www.jeebei.com/pingce/hufupin/ql1z6.html) lists the ingredients as follows:\n\n> 水，乙醇，氧化锌，三乙氧基辛基硅烷，甲氧基肉桂酸乙基己酯，丁羟甲苯，甘油三（乙基己酸）酯，异壬酸异壬酯，丙烯酸钠/丙烯酰二甲基牛磺酸钠共聚物，异十六烷，聚山梨醇酯-80，丁二醇，甘油，双-乙基己氧苯酚甲氧苯基三嗪，乙基己基三嗪酮，聚二甲基硅氧烷，黄原胶，EDTA 二钠，水解胶原，苯氧乙醇，透明质酸钠\n\nThis translates to:\n\n> Water, Ethanol, Zinc Oxide, Trimethoxycaprylylsilane, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, BHT, Triethylhexanoin, Isononyl Isononanoate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Polysorbate 80, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\nThis is the ingredient list for the Japanese 2018 formula, according to the packaging of a tube I bought in a major drugstore in Japan:\n\n> Water, Zinc Oxide, Ethanol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Triethylhexanoin, Isononyl Isononanoate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Isohexadecane, Polysorbate 80, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, BHT, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Collagen\n\n*Both are my own translations and I don’t have a background in chemistry. Also, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate = Octinoxate, Ethylhexyl Triazone = Uvinul T 150, and Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine = Tinosorb S.*\n\nObviously, the order of the ingredients differ, but I don’t know whether China has the same rules about the order of the ingredients or not. One definitively different point, though, is that the Chinese version contains Phenoxyethanol and the Japanese version doesn’t. So while I can’t say how different or similar the two versions might be, it’s clear that they aren’t exactly the same.\n\nIt’s been pointed out that the [Bioré UV Athlizm essence](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/biore-uv-athlizm-skin-protect-essence/)^(E) and the [Bioré UV Aqua Rich gel](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/biore-uv-aqua-rich-watery-gel-2019/)^(E) and [essence](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/biore-uv-aqua-rich-watery-essence-2019/)^(E) are all rated SPF 50+ PA+++ [in China](https://www.kao.com/cn/products/biore/),^(SC) and not SPF 50+ PA++++ as they are rated in Japan, but since they are sold ~~(and possibly manufactured)~~ locally by Kao (China) Holding Co., Ltd. rather than as import products from Japan, you would have to consider the possibility that they may not necessarily have the same formulation as the Japanese equivalents.\n\n**EDIT:** I’ve just figured out that the Chinese versions of the Allie gel and Bioré UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence are made in Japan with different formulations specifically for the Chinese market. See links re: each product [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gyhq3fu).\n\nSimilarly, RatzillaCosme says in a comment on [this page](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/skin-aqua-uv-super-moisture-gel-spf50-4-plus/) that “Rohto products that are marketed for outside of Japan have different ingredients/formulas than Japan’s and they’re not Japan-made (despite the Japanese printed). If the Japanese version is what you want, both the packaging and product name need to be exactly the same as what \\[is\\] shown in my site.” They also say in a comment [here](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/skin-aqua-uv-super-moisture-essence-2020/) in response to an inquiry about [Sunplay Skin Aqua](http://www.mentholatum.com.cn/home/products/skincare/sunplay/index.shtml) Watery Essence SPF 50+ PA++++ (I’m not sure but possibly [this](http://www.mentholatum.com.cn/home/products/skincare/sunplay/detail-75.shtml)^(SC)), “That product isn’t Japanese — it’s made in China by a different company. It isn’t produced by Rohto Pharmaceutical in Japan.” (Credit goes to someone on this sub for mentioning that Ratzilla talks about this in their comments section. I’m sorry I can’t remember who it was.) Going back to the HKCC report, the results table says that [Sunplay Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Gel](http://www.mentholatum.com.cn/home/products/skincare/sunplay/detail-72.shtml)^(SC) is manufactured in China (in addition to the “Sunplay” in the product name already being a giveaway; in Japan, [Mentholatum Sunplay](https://jp.rohto.com/uv-sunplay/) is a separate Rohto brand alongside Skin Aqua, so “Sunplay Skin Aqua” doesn’t exist), so the results in the report would not necessarily be applicable for the Japanese product, not to mention the other concerns I discussed.\n\nSo the situation arises where there are products that aren’t “fake” but also aren’t exactly the same thing as what’s sold in Japan, kind of like how the American versions of LRP sunscreens wouldn't contain their more advanced filters (which is probably more drastic of a difference than what I’m discussing here). This might be especially important for anyone buying the product from non-Japanese vendors. Double check to make sure you’re getting the version you intended to buy—and if you specifically wanted the non-Japanese version, that’s great too. Like [the American and Japanese Curél Intensive Moisture Creams](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/labr3m/difference_between_japanese_and_american_version/), it’s possible that the end result (the user experience) is pretty much the same anyway, but in the case of sunscreen, make sure you know what the SPF/PA rating is for the exact version you’re buying.\n\n# Using sunscreens from major corporations\n\nIn [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNsoPyo1PjA)^(J) posted on March 26, 2020, skinfluencer Arata Tomori says that SPF testing is usually outsourced to a third party lab, and that PA testing is often performed in-house (I haven’t looked into this). She says that different labs can come up with different results, and based on her own past experience with trying to make a sunscreen (I think she has her own skincare line), she has heard of labs that are actually known to give higher SPF ratings. She recommends that we stick with major corporations that are more likely to be working with labs that would provide accurate results.\n\nIn [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTS0Xd-T97s)^(J) posted on March 28, 2020, cosmetic chemist YouTuber Sumisho discusses issues with SPF ratings in general, with the AMA Laboratories case in the US as an example. He says we should be careful with smaller brands, and advises that it’s a good idea to pick products that are made by major corporations that put a lot into sunscreen R&D. He also advises that products sold in China go through additional testing and could be more reliable, and that you could check Tmall for listings, but I want to add again that you would need to make sure you’re looking at the version you want.\n\nOdile Monod also breaks down the difference between OBM, OEM, and ODM products in [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC8r3S0i0Ro) I mentioned earlier. Although she’s talking about the Korean beauty industry, I think this part probably applies for other countries, too, and she advises that it’s (not necessarily foolproof but) a good idea to pick OBM products that are formulated and manufactured in-house.\n\nAnd now [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/n8afq7/discussiondirector_of_japan_cosmetic_industry/) about the response u/ysy_heart got from the JCIA director can be interpreted to back up this approach as well. I’m generally in favor of indie brands in spirit, and usually I would think more about how these people might be benefiting from making these claims, but I do see how major corporations would have a lot more to lose from these sunscreen scandals. I also don’t think I’ve seen companies like Amorepacific (for instance) mentioned in connection with the recent scandal in Korea.\n\nI’m still looking up different sunscreens and who actually manufactures them, but the Kao Group (including Kanebo), the Kosé Group, the Pola Orbis Group, the Rohto Group, and the Shiseido Group are some major Japanese corporations that seem to generally have OBM products. I have a huge spreadsheet in progress that I plan on sharing whenever I think it’s ready, with specific products from these companies (and others) and some properties I wanted to compare.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nIf you’re *really* concerned about the accuracy of SPF/PA ratings, I guess the truly thorough approach would be to look at as many tests as possible. You could either stick with the sunscreens that consistently do well in third party testing (guilty until proven innocent) or avoid those that consistently do poorly (innocent until proven guilty).\n\nThe problem with this approach is that it just isn’t realistic, especially considering how frequently Japanese sunscreens are reformulated. A test result from last year might not be applicable for a product that was reformulated this year. You would have to make sure where the product tested was manufactured and what year it was released, and then there are the potential issues with storage conditions and different batches, etc. Also, “real” testing is expensive, and it’s not all that likely that there would be multiple credible third party tests following official protocols performed on the same formulation.\n\nAs Professor Tong says in the *South China Morning Post* article, we should probably accept that no single test is going to be an absolutely definitive one. Personally, with regard to what I’m already using, if it’s keeping my sun allergy symptoms from showing up, that’s good enough for me—but I guess you could say that I have the advantage (?) of my face being a hypersensitive UV meter of sorts. As for any products I might try in the future, I’m going to keep trusting the ratings as they are claimed unless there’s a scandal specifically involving that product. We *are* already taking a kind of leap of faith in trusting that the product is otherwise safe to use and that the ingredient list is correct and so on. And regardless of any tests results, even good ones, I would make sure to apply plenty, to reapply, and to avoid relying on sunscreen alone, especially if I’m going to be outside for an extended amount of time.",

I’ve been living in Japan for over 10 years, and am under the impression that the general consensus among Japanese consumers is that you use either Anessa or Allie if you don’t want to tan/burn, Anessa being top-level protection and Allie coming in second while also being easier on your skin. (This seems to specifically be based on Anessa’s [flagship milk](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/anessa-perfect-uv-sunscreen-skincare-milk-a-2020/)^(E) and Allie’s gel products, even though Anessa also has gels and Allie also has a milk.)\n\nThis doesn’t necessarily mean they’re absolutely the best sunscreens in the entire Japanese market, of course—the products discussed on this sub represent just a small fraction of all the sunscreens available in Japan—nor do I know how they would really compare with European sunscreens (which I’ve never used, aside from a couple of Asia/Australia-specific LRP products), but it does suggest that they must at least be among the best that are commonly available in drugstores nationwide.\n\nAllie sunscreens seem to do well in those completely unscientific experiment memes where people apply a ton of different sunscreens on their backs and lay out in the sun:\n\n|**Video/Article**|**Sunscreens and UV source**|**Conclusion**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Sunameri for Kakaku.com, [人気の日焼け止め10種を徹底比較！ 日サロで肌を焼いて効果を確かめてみた](https://kakakumag.com/houseware/?id=11834), January 14, 2019|10 sunscreens including Allie Extra UV Gel (2018 formula);

I personally would go for the Be Plain when it's available because it has a simplified formula without the unnecessary plant extracts and flower oils. I think the Be Plain one would be better for oily skin than the Round Lab one. Both of the Hyggee sunscreens look promising, but I'm gravitating towards the Vegan Sun Cream because it is a chemical sunscreen and I have a tan complexion, I don't want to risk a white cast. However, the Real Sun Cream does have an interesting ingredient list and whipped texture (as I can see on Yesstyle)  and I will be looking out for reviews to see whether it leaves a white cast or not and make my decision accordingly. What I love about the Hyggee sunscreens is that they are fragrance/essential oil free, but they still contain alcohol. I prefer alcohol because it allows the sunscreen to set better and be less tacky. If you have oily skin, I would think that one of the Hyggee sunscreens would work better for you because I have a Kolmar sunscreen (Isntree Watery Sun Gel) that is similar to the new Round Lab and Be Plain sunscreens and I definitely wouldn't recommend it for oily skin as it is way too shiny.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that the Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream has beet root extract, which made me think of the Krave Beet Shield. Get this, the Beet Shield was also made in Cosmax, same as this new Hyggee one. So I did some digging and found out that the Beet Shield has the SAME exact 5 filters as this new Hyggee sunscreens in the same order. The rest of ingredients are not too similar though, so I do not think they are the same exact sunscreen, as opposed to how I feel about the Be Plain and Round Lab sunscreens, which I do think are almost identical. I do think this Vegan Sun Cream is inspired by the Beet Shield, with maybe an improved formula, since the Beet Shield did not pass SPF tests. So if you are looking for a replacement of the Krave Beauty Beet Shield but with verified SPF protection, get the new Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream!",

Anyway, Biore claims that these products stay on evenly in severely hot and humid weather. This gets me very excited as I live in a very hot and humid area (75% - 85% and 30°C to 37°C during day time) so I would like to test this ~~or these~~ as soon as I get my hands on them. Will be sold from 9th February 2019 in-store with limited availability on Japanese online stores at an earlier date priced at [1944 JPY RRP](https://www.amazon.co.jp/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?__mk_ja_JP=カタカナ&url=search-alias%3Dbeauty&field-keywords=ビオレ+UV+アスリズム+スキンプロテクト). ~~internal cries and gasp~~ but to be fair it has more grammes. \n\n**Ingredients**:\n\n~~Again, hasn't been released but mentioned:~~\n\n* ~~Hyaluronic Acid, Royal Jelly extract, and Butelyne Glycol (moisturising ingredients).~~\n* ~~White floral scent (made from natural fragrances), Citrus, Musky Wood.~~\n\nEssence: \n\nWater, ethanol, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, ethylhexyl triazone, isopropyl palmitate, (lauryl methacrylate / sodium methacrylate) cross-polymer, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate (Uvinul A Plus), hydrogenated polyisobutene, sodium acrylates copolymer, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (Tinosorb S), dextrin palmitate, BG, (acrylates / C10-30 alkyl acrylate) crosspolymer, alkyl benzoate (C12-15), glycerin, propanediol, potassium hydroxide, glyceryl behenate, hydroxyethylcellulose, (vinyl dimethicone / methicone silsesquioxane) crosspolymer,  pullulan,  cetyl alcohol , sorbitan distearate, stearoyl glutamic acid, arginine, EDTA-2Na,BHT, royal jelly extract, sodium hyaluronic acid, phenoxyethanol, fragrance.\n\nMilk: \n\nCyclopentasiloxane, zinc oxide, ethanol, water, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, (lauryl methacrylate / sodium methacrylate) cross-polymer, dimethicone, hydrogenated polyisobutene, isopropyl palmitate, talc, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate (Uvinul A Plus), titanium oxide, alkyl (C30-45) dimethylsilyl polypropylsilsesquioxane, polymethylsilsesquioxane, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (Tinosorb S), Butelyne Glycol, PEG-12 dimethicone, triethoxycaprilsilane, PEG-3 dimethicone, Aluminium hydroxide, stearic acid, methicone, BHT, royal jelly extract, sodium hyaluronate, phenoxyethanol, fragrance.\n\n**So, what are their claims?**\n\n* **Unique durable \"Tough Boost\" technology:**\n   * Supposedly stays on skin even during hot and humid conditions of 40°C and 75% humidity even when skin perspires or sweats.\n   * Super waterproof which lasts 80 minutes through water resistance tests but easily cleansed.\n   * Usable as a makeup base (so...white cast? primer?)\n* **Two versions**:\n   * Water-based essence (70 g): fresh and moist feeling that leaves the skin with a smooth sensation.\n   * Oil-based milk (65 ml): silky touch that glides on the skin with a light-weight sensation, no stickiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ii2mnvhve8621.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=3215d1e3ed7e8e9b5eabc5a3b78bcdbe9f3553f6\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that Biore UV SaraSara Line (so, Perfect Milk, Bright Milk, Face Milk and Spray) is repackaged but no reformulation. Only the cardboard packagings seem to change to my eyes.\n\n[Here if you want to see the complete list of Biore UV lines (in Japanese).](https://www.kao.co.jp/bioreuv/itemcheck/) On the table there are star ratings. The first one is its suitability for children and the second is how well it interacts with makeup (whether makeup slip or not).",

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

Sometimes it feels hopeless. \n\nAnother question, Is it common to get a lot of ingrown hair when you have KP on your legs? That is happening to me. I have been using the products you mentioned for about 2 months now and I think the KP is lessening, but as soon as I shave my legs, the ingrown hairs come and that looks horrible. I can't get laser hair removal at this time, but damn, hopefully in the near future! Can you get it done if your hair isn't as dark??",

    "body": "Extracts of Centella Asiatica can be present in skincare in a number of different forms:\n\n* Centella Asiatica Extract, which is powder or liquid extract from the plant\n* Centella Asiatica Leaf Water, which is a highly dilute extract created by soaking centella leaves in water\n* individual extracted triterpenoids (the phytochemicals in centella that are responsible for most of its beneficial effects) i.e. **madecassoside**, **asiaticoside**, **madecassic acid**, and **asiatic acid**\n* patented combinations of any of the above.\n\nCentella is effective at very low concentrations; even just 0.1% madecassoside has noted effects on the skin. However, it can be hard to tell exactly how much centella is included in product due to labelling laws, which (in both Korea and the US) allow ingredients under 1% to be arranged in any order. In addition, Korean products may order ingredients based on the total amount of the extract added to the formula rather than the individual ingredients in the extract. For example, even if the extract only contains 0.01% centella and is 99.99% glycerin, if you used 5% of that liquid in your serum, you would list the extract in the ingredients list as a 5% concentration. In contrast, in the US, individual sub-ingredients in an extract are ordered based on their individual concentration in the total formula. So you'd likely have glycerin at the top of the ingredients list and centella near the bottom.\n\nTo make things even more confusing, extracts can vary in strength based on extraction technique, the amount of the true plant extract included in the liquid by the manufacturer, and the season and location of the centella harvest.\n\nI really wanted a product with all four triterpenoids included (as they all have slightly different effects, apparently?) and/or a known, patented extract. The two extracts I focused on:\n\n* **TECA** (titrated extract of centella asiatica), which is a patented powder extract consisting of 40% asiaticoside, 30% madecassic acid, and 30% asiatic acid. Many of the studies on centella have used TECA in their experiments. It is an extremely pure extract (95% triterpenoids) so what you see is what you get, pretty much. If you see asiaticoside, madecassic acid, and asiatic acid listed in a formula sans madecassoside, it probably contains TECA (or possibly a similar extract made by a competitor called Plantactiv).\n* **Supercentella** is a newer liquid patented extract consisting of all 4 major centella triterpenoids - madecassoside, madecassic acid, asiaticoside, asiatic acid. I am not sure if it's 25:25:25:25 ratio or not.

In addition to all 4 triterpenoids, it also has polyglutamic acid, 2 forms of hyaluronic acid, panthenol, urea, and licorice!\n- Sidmool Good Spot Cream: I wanted something occlusive/ointment-y for spot treating, and I wanted to get at least one product with a disclosed concentration of the good stuff.\n- Sidmool Centella Lip Essence: I’ve been wanting an overnight lip mask for a while... why not a centella one?!\n\nI also grabbed some sample foils of the A’Pieu Madecassoside Gel and a tub of their Lip Sleeping Mask to try (I couldn’t decide if I wanted a lip balm or essence... why not both?!).",

Also loves tags and socks..leaves, mulch etc. 😅We have tons of toys available but he doesn’t chew them. I assume maybe a toy or bone that has a food smell might be best?

If you really want to make your muscles \"pop\" and look defined you have to play with the lighting. I did some research and decided to experiment with rim lighting/back lighting. Here are the photos and a diagram that shows my setup:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/44LAy\n\nFor the back lights I picked up two of these: http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/20169658/ they're only $12 each and very bright.\n\nFor the spotlight, I already had a light in the ceiling. It's just a regular incandescent bulb but to create more of a spotlight effect I wrapped aluminum foil around it to narrow the light down more. As far as I know aluminum isn't flammable but I'm not responsible if you hurt yourself or burn your house down.\n\nTo get some sheen in the skin I used glycerin. You can buy it at the drug store.\n\nFor reference here are my older pictures where some were taken in the same room, they look a lot flatter. http://i.imgur.com/xhzeX3A.jpg \n\nEDIT: Oh I forgot to add that for the lights, I didn't use any soft boxes or anything to diffuse the lights. The spot light I purposely bout a \"clear\" rather than frosted bulb. You want HARD light rather than soft light to bring out harder shadows for more definition.\n\nand for anyone asking I'm 5' 8\"/172cm 155lbs/70.3kg.",

No white cast whatsoever :)|Has a significant sheen. Doesn't like to \"sink in\" on the face; remains spreadable and moves around. Doesn't rub in evenly; leaves white streaks on the face that are literally impossible to 100% blend out (also [these tiny white specks](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ff5f815faede7ce5649a190212000a4a/tumblr_pnuvm7CC2x1vnh3sio1_540.jpg)).

Shine leans more dewy than oily. Despite the shine this is neither moisturizing nor drying.|Still has a white cast (though it fades very slightly) and looks shinier than the shaka. On the face it looks quite ridiculous and I always find the need to powder over it to hide the cast and shine. The shine is not \"dewy\", it's definitely oily. I would not say this is wearable for any skin tones darker than NC30 without a colored foundation/powder on top. Despite the shine this is neither moisturizing nor drying. |\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After 15 minutes, with flash.

In both cases I was sufficiently protected; no burns or tans, no deepening of PIH (and I tan/get PIH very easily -- most US and Asian formulations aren't protective enough for me). For me this works just as well as the old formulation, if not better.\n\n\\--\n\nOverall, I was pleasantly surprised by this reformulation. Not only is it more cosmetically elegant in terms of both shine and white cast, but it has a slightly higher PPD and doesn't contain octocrylene, which was one of the ingredients I didn't quite like in the old formula. \n\nI will continue to purchase this sunscreen and look forward to seeing how it holds up in higher (summer) UV indices.",

Now...I'm a Quest-bar-aholic, and even those have a decent number of Net Carbs....so here is a bar with only 2 Net Carbs?! Sign me up!\n\nWell, I went to the website to check them out.\n[The nutrition information for them is here](https://extendbar.com/pages/sugar-free-food-products-healthy-food-for-diabetes-protein-bars-for-diabetes)\n\nWhat the heck?!\nSo, the first bar on that site, the Chocolate and Caramel bar.\nShows....23g Carbs total.  3g Fiber. 1g Sugar. 10g Sugar Alcohol.  Ok...some quick math.  There are 9 carbs missing!!\n\nThe first huge red flag...those 10g of Sugar Alcohol are Maltitol.  That's a no-go right there.\n\nThen, the breakdown on the bar says \"23g Carbs - 3g Fiber - 10g Sugar Alcohol - 9g Other carbs\"\nWhat the hell is \"Other carbs\"?!? and why are they subtracting it??\n\nScrolling down the page to other flavors, I finally found an explanation.\n\"Nonfactor Other carbs include Uncooked Cornstarch, and Glycerin, which convert slowly, and thus have a minimal impact on blood sugar\".\n\nI'm sorry, but this is borderline marketing fraud.  (in my opinion)\nThey seem to be counting Net Carbs based on how it affects blood sugar levels??  In that case, they should count Maltitol as a carb, since it spikes levels like no ones business.  \n\nI guess...it just makes me upset that someone that might not be more informed about keto might think that they could eat TEN of these bars and still be under 20 for the day.  It seems very disingenuous to me.\n\nWe need to remain vigilant in these new products that seem to be coming out, and are preying on the low carb advertising.  \n\nThoughts on this?",

It's NOT low carb**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA quarter cup portion of this flour is 13 net carbs, because it also contains several rice flours, cornstarch, cane sugar, and tapioca flour. The author is misleading, either intentionally or because they really don't understand low carb.\n\nIf I were cynical, I'd say the reason they added four different type of rice flours and a tapioca flour is so that cauliflower flour would still be the top-listed ingredient.\n\nThis company also makes cauliflower pizza products that are high in carbs. IMO, they are embracing the **cauliflower** craze without caring that the craze is a result of people looking for **low carb** foods.\n\nGreen Giant also sells some frozen cauliflower veggie tots. I know some people here have bought them, thinking they are low carb. No, not really. I was surprised, because Green Giant does have some very good frozen riced cauliflower products.

Neither of these things are bad for you, and both have active benefits.  \n\nThe reason is that when you calculate the \"net carbs\" you *can no longer rely on the equation of fiber minus sugar*.  The only reason you're able to do that with vegetables and fruits is because those carbs that you would normally count are wrapped up in (usually insoluble) fibers that your body will not digest.  THIS is why you get to \"remove\" them from the carb count.  *Because you won't digest them anyway.*  \n\nBy adding raw fiber to the ingredients, this does *absolutely nothing* to prevent your body from digesting the already free-floating sugars found in the ice cream.  Thus the carb count can't be trusted *at all*.  \n\nHalo Top is by far not the only company creating food products with artificially lowered net carb counts, either.  They're just the one I see people talking about (as if they're keto friendly) the most on here.  \n\nYou really can't trust food products.

Topical application of mayonnaise results in the removal of dead skin and soothes chapped lips, feet, and elbows. It is also helpful in treating sunburnt skin as it soothes the burnt skin and heals it.”",

It washes off the natural oils they do have. I started using WEAVER WATERLESS SHAMPOO once a month and give them a scrubbing with BABY shampoo about once every three months. Only one of my pigs will allow this, the other is afraid of baths.\n\n- I tried olive oil, coconut oil etc. etc. It is difficult to put sunscreen on all over their body so they don't fry in the sun. They go roll around in the dirt and EVERYTHING stocks to them. The rub on the walls a big oily splotches appear. It didn't help.much at all. \n\n-I started adding Flax seed, two tablespoons a day, plus one tablespoon Mana Pro Pig skin health powder. The Flax seed must be ground into a powder with a coffee grinder, a blender or food processor does not work. Feeding them ungrounded Flax seed, it just passes through their system as a whole seed.THIS WORKS.\n\n-One tablespoon of coconut oil.or olive oil in their food everyday.\n\n-You must brush them thorough,  I mean a good 10 minutes, three times a week. THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOME FLAKING, don't fret it. It's not hurting them. \n\n- Every couple weeks spray them with Weavers Conditioning spray. Then bush it in. Much better than any oil.",

    "body": "Hiya,\n\nI hope you enjoy the below reviews. I'm just a regular consumer buying everything with my own money - i.e., nothing sponsored, etc. Note, I've bought all of them on sale for around AUD$15-20 because I like sales haha.\n\nProducts:\n\n1. PKY - essence toner;\n2. PKY - mist toner;\n3. Secret Key - fresh nature toner - milk brightening one;\n4. Benton - Aloe BHA Toner;\n5. Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner; and\n6. Purito - Centella Green Level Calming Toner & the unscented version (Purito Unscented Centella Toner)\n\nMy skin used to be severely dry but is now slightly dry on the cheek areas and slightly oily on the t-zone during summer and slightly dry on the whole face in the winter.\n\nAlso note that the below two PKY products have different 'actives'/hero ingredients notwithstanding them seemingly being quite similar! I've bolded the plant extracts under the ingredient headers below.\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Essence Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495), *Australian* websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. *Note, this one is generally recommended for people with drier skin whereas the mist version is generally recommended for those with oilier skin* Friends with eczema have also used this with success. *.* I can use both year round without breaking out. I've had friends with oilier skin who've used this one and have broken out. YMMV.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** LOVE THIS. May repurchase this for the rest of my life. I've used this after breaking my moisture barrier, after chemical peels, after active masks, and also *after getting my face ablatively lasered (after the the initial few days of only using an ointment)*. It's REALLY benign in a godly way. If you want it to do anything other than hydrate or increase the penetration of your other actives, this isn't the product for you (note, it doesn't claim to do anything else apart from hydrate & calm really).\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a little bit thicker than water but not as thick as the Purito centella toners. Won't run off your hand/face like water will but will eventually run off.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** None at allll, even when I broke my moisture barrier.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? Yes**/I have rebought this 4 or so times so far.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Mist Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance. This is in a spray bottle and is better suited to oily skinned persons.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1060395517?cpid=1060395516&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1060395517%3Fcpid%3D1060395516%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=876677637398885328), and Australian websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/pyunkang-mist-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. This one is more for people with slightly oilier skin too. It's a lighter formula than the essence one.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Decent hydration, I prefer to use this in the toner stage instead of after my skincare but I have enjoyed using it as a 'refreshing' spray during the day.\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a nice mist, doesn't run on the face. Feels like a spray of water?\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a spray bit on top. I've had no issues with it but one mate had a couple that didn't spray properly.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** Unsure. I've rebought it once but haven't gone to use this one as much as I have the PKY essence toner or the Purito Unscented Centella Toner. I also don't like mists a whole bunch as they can go onto your clothes (if you're out) or jewellery if you're wearing any. But, I did go through a phase of keeping it in my handbag and using it when out and about for a bit of hydration.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Coptis Japonica Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Secret Key - Fresh nature Toner (Milk Brightening)**\n\n**What is it:** Hydrating toner that's meant to brighten your skin.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$18, available at most Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1046235717?cpid=1046235720&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1Qdkb986HWmYC5sW0qasR1pWtsW7lghSexIGgi-jRjHsBnCFbuQ2bVPKRoCtMgQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1Qdkb986HWmYC5sW0qasR1pWtsW7lghSexIGgi-jRjHsBnCFbuQ2bVPKRoCtMgQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1046235717%3Fcpid%3D1046235720%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/secret-key-fresh-nature-toner-248ml), [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/collections/secret-key) etc\n\n**Who's it for:** Unsure - it's advertised on YesStyle for 'sensitive skin' and dry skin.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** Tried a couple of times mid 2020, tried again at the end of 2020.\n\n**My thoughts:** Not a fan. Couldn't use it long enough to notice anything.\n\n**Smell:** A very strong scent that I could barely use it. I think I used it around 5-10 times before binning it - I couldn't even put up with the scent of this to use it on other parts of my body.\n\n**Feel:** really watery.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Fortunately (given the high fragrance), no reactions to this. If you had any irritation though, I'd expect some sort of reaction.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? No**, given I threw mine out.\n\n**Ingredients:** Not a comprehensive list given there's a generic list on yesstyle then a list below it for the main ones in the milk one but here -\n\n700ppm) \\[**sic**\\], 1, 2-Hexandiol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata Extract, Nonoxynol-12, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Tremella Fuciformis Extract, Allantoin, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Cucumber Extract, Propylene Glycol, Tomato Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Rice Extract, Lanoline, Tea Tree Leaf Water (9, Sciadopitys Verticillata Root Extract, Pumpkin Extract, Papaya Fruit Extract, Oleth-10, Viola Tricolor Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Ethanol, Glyceryl Stearate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Chamomilia Recutita Flower Extract, Morus Alba Bark Extract, Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Lemon Extract, Oleth-5, Sodium Hyaluronate, Potato Extract, Pomegranate Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Sap Extract, Bean Extract, Aloe Vera Leaf Water (9, Broccoli Extract, Glycerin, Green Tea Extract, Plantago Asiatica Extract, Hollyhock Root Extract, Witch Hazel Extract (9, Phenoxyethanol, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Mineral Oil, Ulmus Campestris Extract, Carrot Extract, Polysorbate 80, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rose Damascena Flower Water (9, Korean Raspberry Extract, Milk Protein Extract (9, White Willow Bark Extract, Psidium Guajava Fruit Extract, Witch Hazel Extract, 4-Terpineol, Algae Extract\n\nand then it says the main ones in the milk version are -\n\ngalactomyces ferment filtrate, pomegranate extract, physalis alkenkengi extract, milk protein concentrate, raspberry extract, pasque flower extract, potato extract, carrot extract, pumpkin extract, rice extract, usnea extract, broccoli extract\n\nso who really knows what's in it...\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Benton Aloe BHA Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating toner which is meant to gently exfoliate with 0.5% salicylic acid.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$23. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/benton-aloe-bha-skin-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1053033537), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** people with sensitive and dry skin as it's quite rich.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** on and off since mid 2020, still using it randomly to just use it up.\n\n**My thoughts:** Per Google (may not be accurate), it has a pH of 5.5 which is too high for there to be any noticeable exfoliation with 0.5% BHA present. I've not noticed any calming effects. It is definitely hydrating but given it's advertised as a BHA toner I'm quite disappointed at the lack of BHA efficacy here. I would much rather use the purito centella toner to hydrate and calm my skin as the centella has other benefits such as helping to stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** Similar to the PKY essence toner. Not as thick as the purito centella toners.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a pump on top. No issues with it, but it can come out a bit forcefully sometimes.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **No**, almost threw it out but am trying to use it up.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nAloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Water (80%), Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Beta-Glucan, Polyglutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea (Green Purslane) Extract, Psidium Guajava (Guava) Fruit Extract, Salicylic Acid (0.5%), Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract (200mg), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice (200mg), Arginine, Pentylene Glycol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Polysorbate 20, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** **Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 relief toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$25 for 180mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/etude-house-soon-jung-ph-5-5-relief-toner-180ml-180ml/info.html/pid.1058586258), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone. It adds light hydration with benign ingredients - akin to the PKY toners but very minimally more expensive. It'd be good if you have irritated and/or dry skin.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** I used it once/twice a day until I used it up. Bought it in December 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Pretty decent. I'd recommend this to the same group of people who'd use the PKY essence toner. Nothing ground breaking. I prefer the calming nature of the Purito Unscented Centella Toner or even the PKY essence toner if you want zero actives (if you consider centella an 'active').\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** A watery toner.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** No but for no fault of the product. I just prefer using the Purito Unscented Centella one as it's just as benign, a bit cheaper, and has the benefits of centella.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, Propanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Madecassoside, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Polyglycerin-3, Disodium EDTA\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**Centella Green Level Calming Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804) **& the** [**Centella Unscented Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380)\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating and calming toner - may also stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$30 but I've always bought it on sale for approx. AUD$20-25 for 200mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380), [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml)\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone however this is best suited to those with any sort of irritation, acne, or redness. That is, if you have basically perfect skin you're probably not going to notice much of a difference but if you have irritation etc then you'll likely fall in love. Also good if you're wanting to help stimulate collagen production especially for the low price point - target ages for this is probably mid twenties and up.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** religiously since April 2020, sometimes twice a day.\n\n**My thoughts:** *BLOODY EXCELLENT*. I'm on my second bottle of this. My first bottle was the first listed one (scented) and then they released the unscented one so I bought that! It's incredible. I love it. In my opinion, it's partially why my skin is able to tolerate me using actives so much. It's excellent to use before actives as it doesn't interact with anything and really good to use after an 'active' mask or a clay mask etc. I switched to the unscented one to just reduce the risk of irritation.\n\n*also studies, which I haven't read but have seen derms I trust on insta etc, say that* ***centella can help stimulate/produce collagen... a big yes from me given it's a calming ingredient that shouldn't purge you or break you out*** *(unless you're allergic/sensitive to it)!*\n\n**Smell:** The scented one smells herbaceous (akin to Asian herbal medicine - I don't mind it but others may). The unscented one doesn't really smell like anything / I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** thick/fat/heavy water. Not a watery toner. Enjoyable.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Neverrrrrr, this helps me reduce the side effects from using actives such as retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, etc.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **Yes** & I have. Will probably rebuy for life.\n\n**Ingredients:** 4 variants as they've got the scented and unscented versions, and then those with and without witch hazel\n\nnon-witch hazel unscented version -\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract (strengthens skin barrier), Butylene Glycol (humectants), Pentylene Glycol (skin-conditioning agents), Dipropylene Glycol (humectants), 1,2-Hexanediol (stabilizers), Trehalose (humectants), Sodium Hyaluronate (natural moisturizing factor/ humectants), Hamemelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiaticoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiatic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Madecassic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Panthenol (strengthens skin barrier), Carbomer (viscosity increasing agents), Allantoin (skin protectants), Arginine (skin-conditioning agents), Portulaca Oleracea Extract (skin-conditioning agents), Ethylhexylglycerin (skin-conditioning agents), Disodium EDTA (stabilizers)\n\nI hope these reviews were useful :)",

I would only trust claims I can see after using a product. \n\n\nAs far as I know, topical creams cannot generate collagen production. Collagen is created from the foods you eat. I’m not even sure you can take collagen supplements to increase collagen production because everything in your body is broken down in the same way and your body will direct the amino acids to where the body needs it most and not where you might want it.",

Maybe it was the fatty acids, or the silicones, or some other unknown ingredient, but for the life of me I couldn't clear my skin up, and moisturizers were to blame.\n\nFinally, I had the idea to stop buying and trying new products, and kind of, \"DIY,\" my own.\n\nWhat I do is buy pure glycerin and petroleum jelly from the health/first aid section of the store, and 100% squalane from The Ordinary. (I don't think brand matters, just ingredients.)\n\n1. I wet my face and neck, then apply 2-3 drops of glycerin on my hands and spread it all over in a thin layer. Your face should be wet, not damp.\n2. Then, while my face is still damp, I apply four drops of squalane to my face and neck.\n3. On days I'm using tretinoin, I only apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly on my lips, neck, and around my eyes. On rest days, I apply it on the rest of my face as well.\n\nI also do short contact therapy (4-5 minutes) with a benzyol peroxide treatment.\n\nWith glycerin as the humectant, squalane as the emollient, and petroleum jelly as the occlusive, I've pretty much deconstructed an effective moisturizer, and for the first time in years, my skin is clear.\n\nI've been on accutane, antibiotics, spironolactone, sulfur soap, and practically every other treatment under the sun. The only thing that has made a permanent difference has been this deconstructed moisturizer routine. I now only get a pimple if I've been eating poorly.\n\nIf your skin is stupidly acne-prone or moisturizer sensitive like mine is, maybe try this out.",

I didn't really like Rosehip oil either (also The Ordinary). Facial oils are a YMMV situation, but once I learned the difference between linoleic acid vs oleic acid, I was  able to pick the right oil for my skin condition. \n\nBut a drop or two of glycerin diluted in distilled water (my preference to tap) is what is genius and SHOULD work for everyone, and vaseline in a thin layer as a final simple occlusive is simple and perfect and what helps me on dry days.  \n  \nEven if my skin stops being so reactive I still may never go back to conventional moisturizers. \n\nCan I also recommend hypochlorous acid as a good post-cleansing, toner step?!

        "body": "glycerin is amazing. it is the main ingredient in cetaphil skin cleanser. It is also very moisturizing. I buy my own glycerin and use it to wash my face and lightly rinse. You don't need additional moisturizer. I also use Retin A every other night and use Vaseline around the eyes and under the nose as well. My skin is combination and what works is this routine plus sunblock. My dermatologist uses Vaseline and Retin A herself. Steaming at the gym and then swimming will really clear up your skin. I find steam rooms nicer to your skin than saunas. One other thing that will really do the trick: Get some French green clay from the coop or online, pull back hair, lightly massage olive oil or pat it on after steaming (you can do that over a pot), then apply the green clay- not too thick, but not too thin either. Lay down for 15 minutes. It works better if you are relaxed and not moving your facial muscles. Rinse with lukewarm-not hot water. Voila! It will pull shit out of your pores, trust me. Other oils to use: Safflower, Almond. I have even used salicylic acid face wash under the clay on really oily areas. Works like a charm. I am going to try glycerin under the clay. I used to work at a small company that sold health and beauty products and herbs to local coops. I was the tester. Most face products just don't really do the trick and the price point is often high. I started deconstructing products that DID work. Did you know that the most expensive face cream on the planet has a mineral oil base much like Vaseline? Vaseline does not clog my pores. I use it only at night around eyes. Finely ground oatmeal (coffee grinder or food mill) mixed with milk to form a paste is nice. Pat it on, rinse it off after a minute. Raw eggwhite is also excellent. Leave it on for 15, then shower it off. :) Hope this helps. If you can't afford retinA, get adapalene over the counter or online. You will not get acne scarring. I highly suggest this. Adapalene is what I had my acne prone students buy. Life changer.",

Can be used as a moisturizer to hydrate, before makeup as a primer, after makeup to set it, and anytime throughout the day to refresh skin. No need to rinse.

I was constantly scratching my skin and physically exfoliating because it makes you itch like crazy. Once I started recovery I got really into skincare but finding the right products for my skin was so hard. I have super sensitive combination skin. I reacted badly to almost every product | tried, either directly after applying or it would make me break out after 1-2 days. I wasted so much money on skincare items but at least it wasn't for nothing because I finally have a routine that my skin loves! :)\n\nStep one: Avene xeracalm oil cleanser\n\nStep two: Isana ultra sensitive calming serum\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Pentylene Glycol, Glycerin, Polyglycery -6 Stearate, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Coco-Caprylate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Hydrogenated Vegetable Glycerides, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Oenothera Biennis Oil, Panthenol, Ethylhexy|glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Citric Acid, Pantolactone\n\nRight now it's still hot where I live so it's hydrating enough but when it gets colder I use vaseline at night to look in the moisture.\n\nI also use tea tree oil as spot treatment for pimpler & Salicylic acid to exfoliate when I can tell mys v needs it (less than once a week, even that was tu-much for my sensitive skin, it caused break outs)\n\nI do also use sunscreen but I haven't found the right one yet.

It is unlikely that gold provides any notable benefits.**\n\n**The retail price of $100 is not justified by any ingredients or similar product retail prices.**\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\nThis is going to be long, but with everything going around about this moisturizer, I thought it was important to do some actual research on this product and its claims. There are a few things I want to clear up before I start:\n\n\\- This is not a post to start drama or to say bad things about Boxycharm OR Faccia Skin. This is simply research on the claims of the product and whether or not there is evidence that these claims are true. I intend to make NO speculations about this and only present the facts as I can find them (and cite them). If I do make any speculations, please call me out for it and I will remove them.\n\n\\- I am not going to tell you whether or not to use this product. This is just the information I think you should have to make an educated decision for yourself.\n\n\\- I have no stake in this product and hope that makes me as unbiased as possible. I don’t receive premium, and I don’t intend to buy. None of what I say here is based on my experience with the product OR any reviews of the product. \n\nFinally, the intention of this is to investigate these claims based on being an “average consumer.” I know that the actual average consumer does not actually do this much research. What I mean by this is that all this information comes from available online databases and resources, and the first couple pages of Google. I’m not doing a deep dive into any Instagram pages or people’s private lives to find this information. I intend for all of it to be easily verifiable by anyone who wants to find it.\n\nI will investigate 4 things about this product: cruelty free claims, safety of ingredients, benefit claims, and retail value.\n\n**Cruelty Free Claims:**\n\nAccording to [Cruelty Free Kitty](https://www.crueltyfreekitty.com/cruelty-free-101/cruelty-free-bunny-logo/) there are no laws to regulate when a company claims to be cruelty free. However, there are three organizations that have standards to verify a company’s cruelty-free status, and then allow them to use their logo to indicate to consumers that the product has met that set of standards. \n\nFaccia skin uses the PETA “Beauty without Bunnies” logo on their packaging, which means they claim to meet PETA’s standards as a cruelty-free company/product. Also according to Cruelty Free Kitty, if a company uses the logo but does not appear on PETA’s list of approved companies, you CANNOT verify that the product is cruelty-free.\n\nFaccia Skin DOES NOT appear on PETA’s list of approved companies, despite using the logo. According to PETA, in order to use the logo, a company must first be verified as Cruelty-Free by PETA, and THEN is able to pay a one-time $100 licensing fee to use the logos on their products ([PETA](https://www.peta.org/about-peta/learn-about-peta/info-businesses/beauty-without-bunnies-program/)). That means that if Faccia Skin is using the logo, they should already be on the list despite being a new company. The FAQ also suggests that this list is updated frequently so consumers are always up to date with additions, deletions, and other changes. [PETA FAQ can be found here.](https://features.peta.org/cruelty-free-company-search/index.aspx)\n\n**TL;DR – Faccia Skin’s cruelty-free status cannot be verified.**\n\nNote here: Other research on this sub has suggested that this company is owned by the same owner as DLS cosmetics, which is both PETA and Leaping Bunny certified. They may be licensing the logo legally, but from what I can tell, does not verify the cruelty-free status of this brand specifically. \n\n**Safety of Ingredients:**\n\nThis is the list of ingredients for this moisturizer on Faccia’s website:\n\nWATER, GLYCERIN, GOLD, HYDROLYZED SERICIN, CARBOMER, BETAINE, TAURINE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, TRIETHANOLAMINE, NIACINAMIDE, BUTANEDIOL, POLYSORBITULE-20, PALMITOYL OLIGOPEPTIDE, PALMITOYL TETRAPEPTIDE-7, ACETYL TETRAPEPTIDE-5, ACETYL HEXAPEPTIDE-8, EDTA-2NA, HYDROLYZED PEARL, FUCUS VESICULOSUS EXTRACT, SODIUM POLYACRYLATE, PEG-40, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, METHYLPARABEN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, DIAZOLIDINYL UREA, IODOPROPYNYL BUTYLCARBAMATE, PARFUM, CI19140\n\nVia SkinCarisma, 8 products on this list have an EWG Health Rating of “Moderate” or “High” risk.\n\nModerate risk:\n\nGold – SkinCarisma identifies this as a “cosmetic colorant” with no benefits\n\nTriethanolamine – This has a comodogenic rating of (2). Incidecoder says that this ingredient is generally safe, but can form carcinogens if it is included in a product with nitra-/nitro- type ingredients. I don’t see any of those ingredients in this list.\n\nMethylparaben – This is a paraben (obviously). There is nothing directly unsafe about using this ingredient. There was a 2006 study that found that skin cells treated with MP had more harmful exposure to sunlight than non-MP treated skin cells. This study was done in a lab and not on actual human skin, so there’s no direct link to this being harmful. When in doubt, wear sunscreen\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea – A preservative, This ingredient is controversial because it belongs to a family of ingredients that may break down into formaldehyde when added to a formula. A 1990 study found that it is safe in concentrations of <0.5%. The evidence on this is unclear, and since we don’t know what the concentration of this ingredient is, I can’t say definitively if it is safe or not. Use your best judgement.\n\nIodopropynyl Butylcarbamate – Also a preservative. This is safe in concentrations of less than 0.1%, and has an extremely low rate of skin irritation. Since we don’t know what the concentration of this ingredient is, I can’t say definitively if it is safe or not. Use your best judgement.\n\nHigh Risk:\n\nButane – Incidecoder brings this up as Butanediol, which is a solvent to help products absorb faster. Its safety has not yet been questioned. It’s sometimes used as a food additive. HOWEVER the ingredients list does actually say Butane and not Butanediol which is used as a propellant. It’s still safe but it doesn’t make sense for an ingredient that is not aerosolized.\n\nFragrance – The problem with this ingredient is that “fragrance” is a general term that can be made up of an average of 30-50 chemicals that aren’t required to be disclosed. A lot of products use this term and are still safe, but because all the ingredients are not disclosed, we can’t say for sure. Use your best judgement.\n\nOther:\n\nPolysorbate 20 – listed as a fungal acne trigger, but is an emulsifier and is safe.\n\nYou can find all this information at incidecoder.com and skincarisma.com\n\n**TL;DR : Basic judgement says that this product is safe to use, unless you are sensitive to fragrances or other ingredients on this list, react to comedogenic products, or have fungal acne.**\n\n**Benefit Claims:**\n\nOn Faccia Skin’s website, they make the following claims about this product:\n\nHydrate skin – We can expect this result based on moisturizing ingredients (glycerin, betaine, sodium hyaluronate, niacinamide, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, PEG-40, Propylene Glycol)\n\nAnti-aging – SkinCarisma lists Niacinamide as the only anti-aging ingredient.\n\nStrengthen skin – SkinCarisma lists Sodium Hyaluronate as an ingredient to promote would healing. Incidecoder also suggests that there are peptides in the ingredients which act as “cell-communicating” agents. Peptides are fairly common in other products that claim strengthening benefits.\n\nEnhance skin “radiance” – We can expect this based on the ingredient Niacinamide as well as moisturizing ingredients. Skincarisma lists Niacinamide as a “brightening” ingredient.\n\nReduce damaging environmental factors – This may be aided by Sodium Hyaluronate as a “wound-healing” ingredient.\n\nIt’s important to note that neither of these ingredient databases list gold as an ingredient with any skin benefits. Here’s some research on the benefits (or not) of gold for the skin from what I believe to be trustworthy sources:\n\n[https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/sensitizing/gold.html](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/sensitizing/gold.html)\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/fashion/27skinWEB.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/fashion/27skinWEB.html)\n\n**TL;DR – We can expect for this product to perform as it claims based on its ingredients. It is unlikely that gold provides any notable benefits.**\n\n**Retail Price:**\n\nI did a quick search of “best 24k gold moisturizers” to compare retail prices for other notable products. It’s hard for me to definitively test the “retail price” claim unless there was a very similar product out there that I can find. So I’ll have to base this on comparisons as well as knowledge of the ingredients themselves. I don’t know the exact volume of the cream in mL so we are going to assume for now that 50g = 1.6 fl oz someone can get me the actual volume I will change this. So $100 for 1.6 oz is $62.5/oz\n\n[Orogold](https://www.orogoldcosmetics.com/shop/orogold-cosmetics/white-gold/24k-deep-moisturizer/) 24K deep moisturizer: $55/oz \n\n[Physicians Formula](https://www.physiciansformula.com/physicians-formula-24-karat-gold-collagen-moisturizer.html) 24k Gold Collagen Moisturizer: $12.5/oz \n\n[Chantecaille](https://www.neimanmarcus.com/p/chantecaille-nano-gold-energizing-cream-1-7-oz-prod50660039?childItemId=NMC0BE1_) Nano Gold Energizing Face cream: $247/oz \n\n[Farsali](https://www.sephora.com/product/rose-gold-elixir-P417139) Rose Gold Elixer (24k infused) - $54/oz \n\n[Peter Thomas Roth](https://www.sephora.com/product/24k-gold-mask-pure-luxury-lift-firm-mask-P392607) 24k Gold Mask - $17/oz \n\n[Nuface](https://www.ulta.com/gel-primer-24k-gold-complex-brighten?productId=xlsImpprod13521083) Gel Primer 24k Gold Complex - $19.5/oz \n\n[Ahava](https://www.ulta.com/24k-gold-mineral-mud-mask?productId=pimprod2004002) 24K Gold Mineral Mud Mask - $34/oz \n\nThe Faccia cream has a price/oz most similar to the Orogold and the Farsali products, and is much cheaper than the Chantecaille cream which is a luxury brand sold at Neiman Marcus. Comparing the Chantecaille incredients list to the Faccia cream, they are very different. The luxury cream has a huge list of various plant oils, extracts and perfumes. That doesn’t make it better, but it does have more ingredients. The Faccia base of water and Glycerin is similar to other water based moisturizers like Neutrogena Hydroboost, Simple, and even Tatcha Water Cream (although all 3 of those contain dimethicone and variants). Tatcha contains some more ingredients like plant extracts. It’s difficult to compare the ingredients lists of the Farsali and Orogold because the textures of the products are so different. However, the Farsali oil ONLY contains 24k gold, vitamin E, and plant oils as the ingredients, and is still cheaper than the Faccia moisturizer. Additionally, the Orogold lists Gold as one of the last few ingredients.\n\nThere doesn’t appear to be anything in the ingredients list other than gold that would justify such a high retail price. Even other notable brands sold at Ulta and Sephora with gold in them do not reach that retail price, which suggests that the gold alone would not be enough to justify such a high retail price. In fact, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate and Methylparaben are all described as “cheap” ingredients on Incidecoder. One of the other star ingredients, niacinamide, is in a lot of products, and I can’t find anything that would indicate it is expensive. You can buy a niacinamide 10% suspension from The Ordinary for less than $6/oz.\n\n**TL;DR: The retail price of $100 is not justified by any ingredients or similar product retail prices.**\n\nMy conclusion: There is nothing wrong with this product at face value since It is safe for most people to use. If cruelty-free products are important to you, I would not use this product until the company’s cruelty free status is verified. As far as retail value goes, there isn’t any reason for you to repurchase at the retail price, unless you love this stuff and you can afford it. For other people, a basic silicone-free gel moisturizer with niacinamide should give you similar results for a lower price point. You can make your own decision about whether you should use it, but now you are educated on what it is, and you hopefully have a better idea of what you’re putting on your body.",

I have used expensive face creams like Elizabeth Arden Prevage line and see benefits for the cost for that particular brand.  However, I agree that a good moisturizer doesn’t have to cost very much.  Follow the process of cleansing, toning, serum, exfoliating, moisturizer...the massaging of the skin in itself will show benefits!  I can’t afford Prevage since a career change, and I am happier using trial size luxury products now.  The luxury is a gimmick too for the most part!

    "body": "Hello!\n\n# TLDR: I cured my eczema by cutting out ultra processed foods.\n\nI thought I’d come on here and share my journey because I would want someone to do the same if they’d cured their eczema. I’ll write out everything but you can read any sections you want to. I’m not saying this will work for everyone but maybe it will for some.\n\n**Background of my eczema**: I’m a 36 year old woman and have had eczema my whole life. It comes in waves but I never have zero eczema. When it’s at its best I have it on my eye, above my lip, on my neck and hands. When it’s bad I have it all over my face, neck and hands, wrists and my eyes so badly I can’t open them all the way. I rarely have it on my body, but maybe the odd patch if it’s bad eg. nipples and arm crease.\n\n**What I have tried over the years** and how they have worked (*oh boy it’s been rough*):\n\n* **All moisturisers:** E45, La Roche Posay, Cerave, Cetraben, Dipbrobase, Aveeno, Eucerin, Cetaphil, Avene, pure glycerin, olive oil, coconut oil, MCT oil, manuka honey, using nothing at all. -> it will be many, many more than that but you get the gist. Some made it worse, most made no difference.\n* **All steroids, strong and weak**: They did work but then as soon as I stop using them it comes back so after a while I stopped completely because I didn’t want to be using on my face for my entire life. \n* **Elidel / Pimecrolimus cream**: Worked really well but made me feel shit, I didn’t like using it, worried about long-term use and it all came back every time I stopped using it.\n* **Diet changes**: Cutting out sugar, cutting out dairy, being vegan, being ultra-healthy, adding in a lot of good bacteria, intermittent fasting, gluten free, and at one point cutting out all at once: sugar, yeast, caffeine, alcohol, basically a 'candida free' diet. Nothing worked at all and it was horrendous doing all that to no avail 🙃\n* **Misc**: taking supplements, taking probiotics, getting rid of sulphates in everything, shampoo, toothpaste etc, taking antihistamines, colloidal oatmeal baths (and other types of baths), washing my face less/more, natural only shampoos and hand washes etc, sunbeds. There will be more but they all did nothing.\n\nThere is definitely many more things I did that I haven’t remembered/put here (feel free to ask). But nothing worked except medical creams which I did not like to use. \n\n**What did** ***finally*** **work:**\n\nI had got to a point where i was giving up (tended to go in cycles of giving up and then trying again). Then Chris Van Tulken published his book **Ultra Processed People**. In January instead of veganuary/dry jan, or whatever I do normally, I gave up all ultra-processed foods, I had no idea it would do anything to my skin. \n\nBut…. **my eczema went away!!!** Then I started eating them again it came back. Now I have stopped for months and it has gone away to an extent that I have never, EVER, had it go away before ie. completely gone. I have even started using non-eczema friendly moisturisers and it isn’t irritating my skin. For the first time in my life I am a non-eczema person 🥲\n\n**For me, my definition\\* is this: I will not eat food that has** ***any*** **ingredient that you wouldn’t be able to buy for your own kitchen** (there are a couple of exceptions eg. ascorbic acid)**.** \n\nFor me the diet is completely sustainable because there are plenty of unhealthy/treat/fast-to-make foods that fit into this description. There is an UPF subreddit and instagram (linked in the comments) that has amazing recommendations for things like this.\n\n**It took about 1 month of doing this diet for my eczema to basically go away and a few months for it to fully disappear.** These days I might have a day off on a random weekend or if I go out to eat but mainly I stick to it. I don’t know what ingredient I must have been allergic to (I’m assuming it’s a colouring or E number or sulphate or preservative or something like that) but I’m happy to cut out all of them out because I feel much healthier and happier in general anyway. I plan to do it forever.\n\nI can’t tell you how many times i’ve felt very depressed and hopeless from having eczema. How much money and time I’ve spent looking for a cure. I really hope this can help someone. Buy his book (that's not necessary, you can do it without buying the book) try this diet change, see if it works for you. Let us know on this thread!\n\nAlso, **out of all the 'diets' I’ve done this has definitely been the easiest**. It sounds harder than it is and becomes much easier once you find the foods to buy. But make sure to look on EVERY food packet because you’d be surprised; loads of things like tinned tomatoes and chickpeas, some cheeses have it in, most bread, so much stuff - check anything before you buy.  \n\n*side note: the only moisturiser I do like and still used on its own (until v recently when I can now use anything I like) is Dermol 500. I didn’t cure anything but never stung my skin or made it worse.*\n\n**\\*** Some people in the UPF-free world will probably say that I am more on an additive/preservative free diet because - for example - I would eat a 'Crosta + Mollica Margherita pizza' because it fits my definition but some people would say because it is mass produced it is still ultra-processed. For eczema reasons my definition works perfectly.\n\nSorry to add more but **to give a better idea of things I cut out**: that includes things like emulsifiers and natural flavourings and inverted sugar syrup and any ‘acids’, colourings, preservative, e numbers, 'gums', stuff that sounds kind of normal but isn’t something you could buy eg. pea protein. It has to be really strict - can you buy it? If not then it’s a no. Ascorbic acid is an exception because it is just vitamin C and ‘pectin’ is because apparently you can buy that (it’s just in jam) and ‘live cultures’ because they are naturally occurring and are good for you. Those are the only exceptions I can think of right now. I speak more about this in the comments.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions!",

I use all natural cleaners, shampoos, body wash, laundry wash, flouride free filtered water, we eat mostly meat and veggies but still she has issues. I do believe stress anxiety causing situations flare it. (Playing sports as goalie is pretty stressful, aswell as highschool) I had never heard of A2 milk being helpful so I'll try that out for her.  She drinks lactose free normal 2% milk currently.  I also watch ingredient labels with our foods but seem to still battle with flare ups. She reacts to heat, sweat, and swimming pools with chlorine. So we avoid pools and keep cool with air conditioning. But alas we still struggle. We don't eat much processed food but I guess the bread... the milk... the occasional donut or fun drink at a shop would trigger also. I will for sure give this UPF diet change a go. We are steroid cream free home. And vx free since 4years old. She's 15. I do feel deep down the toddler vx is what caused it. We're in Canada so the food is awfully processed here. It's really hard to find and afford real naturally occurring food.  Thank you again for this thread and the videos and articles shared. Much help. Best wishes for everyone here beginning a new hope of clear un irritated skin. Xo",

Weird. I said wow. So now I'm trying organic juices, it's simpler to do it myself but my energy is low, my blood test are normal by medical standards but gut bloats, constant urine infection, I don't have a liver problem and kidneys are safe so far, I'm not diabetic and my weight is okay for 5'5 149-152 lb at 55 yrs old.

I don't know what America is going through and I'm in Los Angeles but I feel like we've come a long ways from when we were children, for those that grew up in rural areas and could eat berries off the vine and burgers were simple, add egg a little milk maybe chop some onions bell pepper throw it in a pan fry it or bake it in a meatloaf, mash some mashed potatoes with a little butter and salt and we're on our way and we're for lucky we make it a salad if we're not too hard luck on money but I'm sure my family did the best they could but we didn't eat a lot of vegetables so I am struggling to eat vegetables as an adult even at 55 years old and so I'm juicing or having it delivered so that I can see about getting my guts bacterial normal or on the right track and try to live life the best I can before life is over, no one wants to be stuck laying in their bed, had pressure, dry eyes from gut issues as if you're not hydrated enough and you're drinking a lot of water daily at least that's what I'm doing but for some reason the water doesn't seem as it was when I was younger however I am from the Pacific Northwest where the water and Puget sound or the mountain s like Mount Rainier or St Helens or wherever the water comes from such as Alaska glaciers it's good but the water here for some reason I don't care which one I grab off the shelf it doesn't seem to drench or quench my thirst so I'm constantly hydrated and yet medical doctor say this is normal but I don't think it is I see 80 year old and a 100 year old people walking talking and join yourself and dancing and prancing and enjoying their life and us 35 to 60 year old seem to be dying before our eyes. If anyone has experienced what I'm experiencing let me know. Give me some suggestions share because I don't think I'm the only one, I'm looking at documentaries of the Asians who live near the blue lagoons and their Asian areas and they are living past 100 unlike Americans that live in the United States, yeah we do things and have water sports and yoga and other things but their lives in the Asian communities seem to be much simpler of the United States no possessions but they seem to be happy and stick together and when one is in trouble financially or sick, they all kick in unrelated stranger helping one another, it amazing but that's not the way it is here, I mean we have people, organizations that do that, but it's not a collective effort, if it was we wouldn't have homeless people. I have never seen a rich person come down to the poor area and pay bills for the ones that can't pay rent or bring groceries to homes in the ghetto without recognition, yet there is people that will do it and the word gets passed around. So I won't blanket every person who is well off. I'm just stating what I have not seen in what I have in my time growing up in America. What I can't understand is? Why eating healthy is so expensive, how did regular vegetables and organic vegetables come into play? When I was growing up there with no such thing, vegetables or vegetables and we're not expensive as they are today and why eating junk food is so easy to come by. Anyway, I'll save that for another long dialogue. I hope that the changes I'm making that are ongoing for these last 15 years something will click within me before my time is over here on earth.  Thank you for listening!:) 🙏",

Not at you,  but at the memory of my partner last weekend. \nHe hasn't been eating my cooking (mostly Thai dishes) for about a month,  because he's trying to get a 6 pack. He's pretty close to be fair,  and my company and affection have been replaced by the home gym and body builder reels on Instagram😆.\nAnyway,  his diet has been mostly plain chicken breast,  lean roast beef and white rice for about a month. If he's feeling fancy,  he'll put a little of my prik nam pla (spicy Thai sauce). So his vegetable intake is maybe 2-3 Thai chillies a week. \n\nLast weekend,  we went to my brother's for lunch. Chicken,  potatoes,  salad,  slaw etc.\nOH had mentioned that morning that he hadn't pooped for a few days and asked if I had any laxatives and stool softener. \n\nHalf an hour after lunch,  he came up to me and said \"we have to go home\" he was sweating and pale grey. \nI had had 2 glasses of wine,  and couldn't drive,  so for over an hour on the motorway he was shrieking \"I feel like I'm having a BABY!!\" unbuckling his seat belt to rise up out of his seat going \"OH GOD, OH GOD!\"\n\nIt was actually really scary at the time. My 11y son threw up his oatmeal,  bowl of strawberries and his chicken lunch out of his car window (OH's car is NEW) because he got car sick. \n\nWhen we pulled into the drive,  I jumped out and opened the door for OH, he ran in and up to the bathroom. \n\nAn HOUR later,  he emerged,  looking like he really had given birth and was 7lbs lighter than when he'd weighed himself that morning. \n\nI cleaned the car while he was recuperating,  and he went to bed early that night. He's been adding tenderstem broccoli to his meals and sprouted grain bread on heavy carb days. \n\nAnd men complain about the stuff women do for vanity...",

You forget you have a shoe on your foot. Plenty of padding around the heel and the upper material is plenty soft and feel super durable. Don't know about the breathability as it good cooler here in Scandinavia. \n\nFits true to size in my size 44.\n\nMidsole, this is where the fun starts, feels very similar to superblast 2 after the superblast broke in. Dense bounce but with an aggressive rocker, I feel the softer midsole in the heel area and bit more denser foam in the forefoot. The shoe just rolls smoothly forward and your legs feel plenty protected. Very stable ride too. Easy to pick up the pace but it's heavier than the superblast so it's more difficult to sustain the pace. But the shoe got few gears in it that's for sure. Probably my top 3 rides of the year, and it will become my new daily trainer and long run option, the shoe doesn't ride as heavy as it is, it just feels super smooth and effortless and I will save the superblast 2 for special occasions as it's easier to find a unicorn than a superblast for sale in my size.\n\nOutsole, ran on some pavement and gravel roads through the forest, both in wet conditions and grip was excellent. The outsole also looks like it will outlive our solar system it self.\n\nA dream shoe for a heavy runner",

They actually took the place of the SL2 and Peg Plus at the top of my list. So when I saw these I thought dang they look nice, but huge stack isn't exactly my thing despite being a bigger runner at 6'3\" 240lbs (108kg). I sent my Peg Plus back and figured Brooks has the great 90 day trial so what can it hurt especially with all the great reviews. As it turns out these are exactly the kind of shoe I needed. The other higher stack shoes I tried were either too soft and bottomed out (Invincible 3) or a little too firm and didn't do the recovery I wanted (Superblast). This fit right in the middle for me like a goldilocks shoe. It was soft and plush, but also bouncy and enough foam to not bottom out. It is the perfect change in stimulus for my legs and great for the lazier days or days when my legs just need a little more protection. Like you said these don't force you to run slow despite the weight. They have a great amount of rebound and pop with a great toe spring. They are a great shoe I would recommend to anyone looking for a shoe in this genre. The price is a little high, but it seems a lot more worth it than some other shoes out there that cost a ton.",

I'm a light runner (125lbs, 57kg), but I'm sure I'll get the same benefits as I have with other max-stack shoes and I get the feeling that I'll end up liking this the most for easy runs. In the max-stack category, I have the PXSv1/v2, SB2, Neo Vista, MagMax Nitro, Skyward X, and More v5. \n\nI felt like I was set with max-stack and then the Glycerin Max comes along and I couldn't resist. I get the sense that it will be the closest to MagMax Nitro out of the aforementioned shoes. The PXSv1/v2 are strictly for fast tempo runs for me. The SB2 and NV are the lightweight versatile daily trainers and mixed-paces long run shoes. MagMax is the easy long-distance cruiser. The Skyward X is the big yet peppy daily trainer and the More v5 is reserved strictly for recovery runs and walks. \n\nIt'll be interesting to see how the Glycerin Max fits in. I'm sure I'll like it a lot and I'll find a way to get it in the rotation. Seems like it'll be good for walking and standing as well. I have a big trade show coming up in January and I'm hoping that this shoe will work for standing around all day by the booth. Standing in basically one spot for days on end seems to require more than just max stack with soft foam. The MagMax and More v5 don't seem all that comfortable for standing for whatever reason, so I'm hoping that Glycerin Max can be my feet saver during the fours days of the trade show and put in some good easy runs in the mornings as well.",

Besides a rookie mistake with additives that made my base smell a little funny, I'm really pleased with how it turned out for a first attempt. 😊\n\nThe soap was easy to load on my RazoRock and Mühle synthetic brushes, and just a tiny amount was enough to produce copious, thick lather.\n\nThe pictures my wife took while I was lathering were already at the second pass. The others I took after finishing my shave. 🪒\n\nThe next steps are trying to make some more and seeing if I can make this unscented base smell better. Then I’ll add the fragrances I’ve been making.\n\n**👃 Fragrances**\n\nThe fragrances I’m really excited to try in the soap are:\n\n * Lavender 🪻, Rose 🌹, Leather notes 👞 (inspired by London, UK 🇬🇧)\n * Sakura 🌸, Green Tea 🍵, Incense 🪔 (inspired by Kyoto, Japan 🇯🇵)\n * An original take on the Bay Rum: Babà au Rum => Sweet Rum 🥃, Coffee ☕, Sea notes 🌊 (inspired by Naples, Italy 🇮🇹)\n\n**🧼 Soap Ingredients**\n\n* Stearic Acid\n* Tallow\n* Shea Butter\n* Kokum Butter\n* Castor Oil\n* Jojoba Oil\n* Glycerin\n* Goats Milk\n* Marshmallow Root Extract\n",

    "body": "So for several months now, I have been wearing what I thought was a healthy amount of sunscreen everyday. I knew it was less than 1/4 tsp (what seems to be the recommended amount), but it seemed like a thick layer. However earlier today, I went through the trouble of measuring 1/4 tsp, to see how off I was, and of course 1/4 tsp was wayyyyyyyy more than I was using. I was probably using around 1/8 tsp. To me, 1/4 tsp seemed really excessive, so I decided to do the maths. I mean who even decided 1/4 tsp was the correct amount for a sunscreen dose of 2 mg/cm^2 for EVERY sunscreen and EVERY face??\n\nTo be conservative, the area I am computing is an ellipse, with one axis value being the top of my forehead to my chin, and the other axis value being my hairline by my ear, across my nose, to my other ear.\n\n* forehead-to-chin: 20 cm\n* ear-to-ear: 23 cm\n* area = pi * (20/2) * (23/2) = 362 cm^2\n\nThis value is actually larger than the actual surface area of your face. If I wanted to be really exact, I would subtract the area of my eyes, mouth, and cutouts which would allow the ellipse to contour my face (think of sheet mask cutouts), but add a bit of area to account for the nose and other small protrusions. All in all, it is obvious that an ellipse with these axes has an area at least as large as your facial surface area.\n\nThe recommended dose of sunscreen is 2 mg/cm^2. It is kind of hard to estimate the density of sunscreen, especially because each sunscreen will have a different density! But I will try to give a conservatively low estimate, using the sunscreen I am currently using, Loreal Sublime Sun SPF 50+. This sunscreen is just okay btw, heavy fragrance, greasy at first, but doesn't break me out at least. Wouldn't repurchase. Anyway, the first ingredient is water, density 1 g/cm^3. The next three ingredients, dimethicone (.965 g/cm^3), isododecane (.74 g/cm^3), and styrene (.909 g/cm^3), all have lower densities. The next three, propanediol (1.06 g/cm^3), glycerin (1.26 g/cm^3), and silica (2.65 g/cm^3) all have higher densities. I figure the rest of the ingredients don't have much of an impact. There is no way to know the exact proportions, so I will estimate the density to be at the lowest .92 g/cm^3 = 4.5 g/tsp.\n\nSo finally we can compute sunscreen amount needed from the following: \n\n* area = 362 cm^2\n* density = 4.5 g/tsp\n* dose = 2 mg/cm^2 \n* area * dose / density =  amount\n* (362 cm^2 * .002 g/cm^2) / (4.5 g/tsp) = .16 tsp\n\nBased on my conservative calculation, I should use .16 tsp for my face to get the labelled SPF protection, much less than the 1/4 tsp recommended here all the time. Maybe I have a small face, maybe my estimation is way off somewhere, although I did my best to estimate as conservatively as possible, but honestly this calculation has made me more confident in my suspicion that 1/4 tsp for my face is excessive. Maybe skincare companies advertise this number so people use more product, or to 100% guarantee that every face gets the advertised SPF, as people may not apply sunscreen uniformly, have large faces, etc? Thoughts?\n\n***DISCLAIMER: I am not a chemist or dermatologist, I am just a girl who likes facts and skincare***\n\nEDIT: Wow this blew up a lot more than I expected! I am definitely not telling you to use less than 1/4 tsp of sunscreen, I just think its important to know where the estimate came from. I think the 1/4 tsp estimate exists because its always better to use more sunscreen than not enough, especially considering the way SPF degrades (e.g. applying 1 mg/cm^2 results in much less than half SPF). I, personally, will not try to use 1/4 tsp anymore. I also think it is foolish to say things like \"using 1/8 tsp will definitely result in SPF 5\". There are many factors that influence the SPF you get, its just important to remember the 1/4 tsp is simply an estimate. Happy sunscreening :)",

Then some people have a bit larger faces, so I'm sure this 0.16 that you need can become 0.2 for some people.\n\nIn general however, there is research in vivo which shows that the SPF scales roughly with the amount applied. This is opposed to the opinion that sunscreen gets divided by some root depending on how much less you use, which IMO is wrong. If you apply half, you get roughly half the SPF. If you apply 50% more, you get 50% more SPF.\n\nSo if you use an SPF 50 PPD 20 sunscreen and you apply only 60% of the standard 2.0mg/cm² you don't have to freak out. You will get about SPF 30 and PPD 12. If you apply 1/4th of a tablespoon you will actually in most cases have a higher SPF and PPD than advertised, if your face isn't gigantic.",

    "body": "# Background\n\nSkinceuticals CE Ferulic is considered the best vitamin c serum that money can buy in the skincare market today. In fact, many people have sweared by the Skinceuticals CE Ferulic, claiming that it makes a larger difference in their skin compared to other vitamin c alternatives. At $166 per oz, it's not as easily accessible by the average consumer. The reason why it's so expensive is because Skinceuticals currently holds the patent for the perfect ratio of vitamin c, vitamin e, and ferulic acid needed to optimize the effectiveness of vitamin c.\n\nThe \"golden ratio\" is **15% L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)**, **1% Vitamin E (Tocopherol)**, and **0.5% Ferulic Aced** with a pH level between **2.5 - 3.0**. Skinceuticals CE Ferulic is also **fungal acne safe**.\n\nGiven the price, there have been a lot of posts and comments asking for dupes of this product.\n\n**Disclaimer: This post is not sponsored. I used my own money to purchase Skinceuticals and Dr.Brenner for the advancement of skincare data.**\n\n## Why should I use Vitamin C?\n\nI'm not going to go into this too much since that's not really the focus of the post, but you can read more about the research behind Vitamin C here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/vitamin\\_c\\_recs](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/vitamin_c_recs)\n\n## Popular Dupes\n\nThere are some well known popular dupes of Skinceuticals out in the skincare market today. Keep in mind, none of the dupes listed will have the exact same formulation as Skinceuticals due to the patent. Below are some popular dupes and the differences it has with Skinceuticals.\n\n**Paula's Choice C15 Booster**\n\n[Link](https://www.paulaschoice.com/c15-super-booster/777.html)\n\nPrice: \\~$65/oz\n\nDisclaimer: I have not tried this product.\n\n|Skinceuticals Ingredients|Paula's Choice C15 Ingredients|\n|:-|:-|\n|Aqua/Water/Eau, Ethoxydiglycol,|Water (Aqua), Ascorbic Acid, Butylene|\n|Ascorbic Acid, Glycerin,|Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Glycerin,|\n|Propylene Glycol, Laureth-23,|PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated|\n|Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol,|Castor Oil, Pentylene Glycol, Tocopherol,|\n|Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate.|Norleucine Acetate, Lecithin, Ferulic|\n||Acid, Panthenol, Bisabolol, Oryza Sativa|\n||(Rice) Bran Extract, Propyl Gallate,|\n||Sodium Gluconate, Sodium Hydroxide,|\n||Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.|\n\nPaulas's Choice claims that this a **15% Vitamin C formula, 1% Vitamin E,** and **0.5% Ferulic Acid** at pH of **3.1**.

They also claim that it is at a pH of 2.5–3. NuFountain **is fungal acne safe**.\n\nMini Review: I did not see any difference using this vitamin c product for a few months, so I discontinued its use.\n\n# Skin(care) Background\n\nI have Asian, sensitive, combination hormonal/acne prone skin. I have lots of PIE due to old acne and lots of freckles and sun damage on my skin due to the fact that I've lived in Hawaii for most of my life.\n\n## Current Routine\n\nMorning:\n\n* ILLI Ceramide Ato Lotion\n* Hado Labo Tokyo Skin Plumping Gel Cream\n* Shiseido SPF40 Sunscreen\n\nNight:\n\n* La Roche Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Face Wash\n* Tretinoin 0.1% cream\n* ILLI Ceramide Ato Lotion\n* Hado Labo Tokyo Skin Plumping Gel Cream\n\nTret has made my skin extra sensitive. For example, my skin is now unable to use the Cerave hydrating cleanser due to how sensitive it is. The La Roche Posay cleanser is the only non irritating cleaner I can use now that I am on Tret.\n\nI have tried multiple Vitamin C products on my skin over the years. Specifically, I've tried Melano CC, NuFountain C20, The Ordinary Vitamin C Suspension, and Philosophy Vitamin C Powder.\n\nI have never been able to spot any visible improvement whenever I started using *any* brand of Vitamin C on my skin.\n\n# Review\n\nThere's quite a number of reviews between Skinceuticals CE Ferulic VS Timeless 20% Vitamin C and Paula's Choice C15 if you make a quick Google search. I didn't want to add to those stats as I think there's enough data there. This post is mainly going to review Skinceuticals CE Ferulic vs Dr.Brenner's 20% Vitamin C Serum. In my opinion, Dr.Brenner is the closest dupe, ingredients wise, to Skinceuticals CE Ferulic.\n\n## Packaging\n\n[Packaging](https://preview.redd.it/y21w3rkgcmi51.jpg?width=1433&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=440c465d015a4ab5b9a285ece3ca393f24c7b33a)\n\nSkinceuticals came in a blue paper box, wrapped in plastic. The actual bottle is pretty opaque, but would definitely still allow light through given that it's glass and I was able to see the serum line quite clearly.\n\nDr.Brenner's came with the glass bottle wrapped in plastic. The bottle was just as opaque as Skinceuticals, and I was also able to see the serum line quite clearly.\n\nThe general guidance for both is to store in a cool, dry place. I've also read online that Vitamin C should be exposed to as little light as possible. Given that, I think Skinceutical's does a better job protecting the product until it gets to the consumer's home given the paper casing. For Dr.Brenner, it's possible for it to be exposed to light while waiting for it to be packaged and sent. However, they do claim on Amazon that they create their Vitamin C serum every 2 weeks to make sure it's fresh.\n\nI stored both of mine in a cupboard, so they're both only exposed to light when I take it out and use it. However, I kept my Skinceuticals in the paper casing while I stored it in the cupboard.\n\n## Product\n\n**Dr. Brenner Vitamin C Serum**\n\n[Link](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-L-Ascorbic-Hyaluronic-Dr-Brenner/dp/B07ZG28M2S/)\n\nPrice: $24.99/oz\n\n|Skinceuticals Ingredients|Dr. Brenner Vitamin C Ingredients|\n|:-|:-|\n|Aqua/Water/Eau, Ethoxydiglycol,|Water, Ethoxydiglycol,|\n|Ascorbic Acid, Glycerin,|L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Propylene|\n|Propylene Glycol, Laureth-23,|Glycol, Glycerin, Laureth-23,|\n|Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol,|Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Sodium|\n|Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate.|Ferulic Acid, Panthenol,|\n||Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol|\n\nAs you can see, the ingredients used in Dr.Brenner is the same as Skinceuticals, although the ordering seems to be different. Dr.Brenner claims that the ratio is **20% Vitamin C, 1% Vitamin E, 1% Hyaluronic Acid,** and **0.5% Ferulic Acid**. Unfortunately, I do not know the pH nor do I have anything to find out the pH of Dr.Brenner. Dr.Brenner **is fungal acne safe**.\n\n## Method\n\nI applied Skinceuticals to the left side of my face, and Dr.Brenner to the right side of my face every morning for 1 month, adjusting for irritation. I also applied the same sunscreen to my entire face after applying the vitamin c serums.\n\n## Thoughts\n\n**Skinceuticals CE Ferulic**\n\nThis has a really strong hot dog smell. The reviews are spot on about this. It really does smell like I'm rubbing hot dog water on my face. The serum is a pale yellow. The texture is slightly more viscous than Dr.Brenner's. The best way I can describe it is that it has the texture of thick water.\n\n**Dr.Brenner Vitamin C Serum**\n\nThis has a faint hot dog smell, not as strong as Skinceuticals. The texture is not as thick as Skinceuticals, it's more runny and has a closer texture to water, possibly due to the higher hyaluronic acid content. The coloring is a lighter yellow than Skinceuticals.\n\nMy before pictures are from when I applied the Vitamin C serums for the first time on each side. My after pictures are 1 month after daily morning application of the Vitamin C serums.\n\nI found that the Dr.Brenner serum is more irritating on my skin than Skinceuticals. I found that the side where I usually apply the Dr.Brenner serum usually gets more red and irritable compared to the Skinceuticals side. However, this only happens when my skin needs a break from Tret, and the irritation usually goes away if I take a break from Tret for a day.\n\n## Final Verdict\n\n[Before Front](https://preview.redd.it/pu2biihlcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7fc6d699da9c03071fedefbf839616465bddf31b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Before Skinceuticals](https://preview.redd.it/pbx6am5ncmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8781476d62dbbf083a306021e119563fd226742)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Before Dr. Brenner](https://preview.redd.it/yr2ofgzocmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2be97af34e9328346fb0b41825bf547bce93c3c3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Front](https://preview.redd.it/b6v0kgoqcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c50ddcdda52d39e8b434fe78d1e0147ff35c41b7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Skinceuticals](https://preview.redd.it/wajzo5zrcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cee0f78bdf18dfe3bd284ed2406eb1b08e753b53)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Dr.Brenner](https://preview.redd.it/24ub6lbtcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a7c5406f55dd31b8823a9ff2a62cba875f2ce29)\n\nResults wise, both sides look pretty similar to me, with the Skinceuticals side looking a bit better. However, this could be due to the fact that I just had more acne scarring on the Dr.Brenner side than the Skinceuticals side. Given the fact that I don't think the difference between the two sides is all that large and my experience with them is mostly similar, I would go for the Dr.Brenner serum and probably apply it every other day. However, if you don't have sensitive skin like mine, I still would recommend Dr.Brenner's serum over Skinceuticals. The reason being that I just don't see *that* large of an improvement from Skinceuticals over Dr.Brenner to justify the 8x price tag. The ingredients are also *very* similar, with the only difference being that Dr.Brenner has more hyaluronic acid.",

    "body": "For a hot minute I was super active on this sub, and ordering haul after haul to try *everything.* My acne prone skin was not happy… but my heart was. I even went through an AB makeup phase, and made my entire makeup routine consist of Asian products!\n\nHowever, that time has past and I’ve fallen out of love with AB and skincare in general. I haven’t used a sheet mask in ages, let alone had anything close to a ten step routine. But I miss this sub! So, I figured I’d make a post about the products I kept and plan to RP despite my obsession having waned.\n\n**Skin type:** Very oily with acne and rosacea.\n\n**Skincare:**\n\n**Banila Co Clean It Zero Balm (Original):** My ride or die first cleanser. Melts makeup easily, even the most stubborn waterproof mascara in existence, and rinses off cleanly without too much effort. I will forever RP.\n\n**Hada Labo Gokujyun Foaming Cleanser:** This was recently reformulated and feels more drying than it was before, but it’s still usable and very economical IMO. Lasts ages, rinses off extremely easily, and doesn’t leave me squeaky. Dry skinned folks proceed with caution.\n\n**SK-II FTE:** I’m so sorry for including this, but I have to be honest… I love the stuff. I buy the biggest size available (preferably via Costco) and only use it in the PM to make it last. My skin feels healthier, it helps my inflammation, and with prolonged use there’s a certain clarity it gives. I’ve tried dupes (Missha, Manyo, Secret Key) but this is the OG.\n\n**Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion:** I’ve tried very hard to replace this with a more “fun” toner, but always come crawling back. I really do think it’s the OG hyaluronic acid toner. I prefer the light version as it doesn’t feel as thick (keeping in mind I have oily skin), but if I can’t find the light one I have no qualms about the “moist” version. Nothing quenches my skin quite as well as this stuff.\n\n**Beauty of Joseon Glow Deep Serum:** I honestly don’t know if this is really doing much for me… but I don’t care, because the texture is beautiful. I definitely notice more hydration when I use this in addition to the Hada Labo toner, most likely because of the glycerin in it. Other effects? Not sure, but again, it sure feels nice!\n\n**Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Soothing Gel:** HG AM moisturizer. It feels nice and quenching without being heavy. I’ve tried lots of other gel creams and emulsions, and this one wins. It dries a little sticky, but that goes away when you apply sunscreen afterwards.\n\n**Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream:** HG PM moisturizer! I use retinoids so I like a nice, heavy cream in the PM, and this doesn’t break out my oily skin.\n\n**Makeup**\n\n**I’m Meme Afternoon Tea Contour Palette:** This is an amazing powder contour palette that works for the fairest of fair skin tones. I plan to RP.\n\n**Dolly Wink My Best Liner:** This is crying proof and oily skin proof, and I swear it will never dry out. I love it.\n\n**Heroine Make Long and Curl Super Waterproof:** The results aren’t super dramatic, but it has yet to smudge on me no matter how oily I get or how much I cry.\n\n**D-Up Eyelash Fixer Glue in 552:** This is *superior* to all western eyelash glues. It’s like cement, I swear it sometimes hurts to take my falsies off. I never experience any lifting no matter how long I wear my lashes or how hard I cry (or nap).\n\nThat’s all! It feels good to make another post, and I hope someone finds it helpful. Let me know if you have any questions!",

Especially when you go all-in on anything, it's easy to burn out once you feel like you've \"done it all\" - I experienced very similar feelings with AB years ago, I felt like I had tried everything I wanted to and then life just got so hectic in the real world that I couldn't keep up if I wanted my mental health to be in check.  I kept my HGs like you did, and then took some detours to try out other venues; I've had routines since that were fully western, all indie, incredibly minimal etc.  Circled back around to AB, and now my collection sits in a happy blended space of everything I've used/learned over the years.  There's no guilt in AB losing its \"magic\" for a while, especially when life itself demands more focus, sometimes you just gotta take a break!  It'll always be there when you want to dip your toes back in :).\n\nBig thumbs up to HG Heroine Make mascara too, I will literally never even bother with anything else at this point - every other brand makes my lashes so clumpy or just melts off my oily eyeballs, but Heroine mascara holds on with the obsessive desperation of an ex lover. 5 stars lol.",

        "body": "Honestly I wish I’d started out slower. I blew through $1k in savings over a couple months this summer when I first discovered AB (AB was what led me to figure out that I actually have dry skin naturally, and that all the harsh astringents + oil control products I used since middle school, for the past 20 years, were causing my skin to overproduce oil and sebum in effort to hydrate my poor dehydrated skin). But because my skin needs changed once I cut out the harsh oil control products, and again once I repaired my moisture barrier, and AGAIN once I started tretinoin - a lot of the unopened, brand new products I have are useless for me. A lot of the products I bought on a whim because of sales/promotions have actually been the ones that turned out to become my holy grail products…and now a few of them are empty but I can’t repurchase them because a) I honestly can’t afford it, I shouldn’t have spent as much as I did anyways (I go overboard and get way too into things often, hence the username 😂) and b) I already have too many unopened products to work through before purchasing any more - even though the products I have stockpiled aren’t exactly suited for my skin anymore, I still can’t waste them because I’m a broke single mom. And it’s so hard to sell even new/sealed skincare secondhand for anything close to what I paid for them - esp AB products which aren’t as well known here or hyped like some pricy western things are ( i genuinely don’t understand how they aren’t more well known though..because 98% of the AB products I’ve tried at any price point have blown even the most boujie expensive western products completely out of the water lol). \n\nSo I guess I’m still in the passionate phase for AB - I’m probably a lifelong convert of AB products tbh - but I’m not passionate about my current stash because I went overboard before my skin was stable. I may try and list some of my new products that I know I CANT use anymore on Mercari or the exchange sub here tonight though - because if I could sell 3 and get enough funds to replace my Skinfood Royal Honey Propolis Essence I’d accept that 😂 that stuff literally gave my face a visible glow isntantly when I put it on, and I definitely notice the difference without it!\n\nAlso, OP - I am 1000% with you on the Illiyoon Ceramdie Ato Cream! I use it AM + PM and it’s been glorious - it replaced my Farmacy Honey Grail which is over 4x the price for less product lol (half as much product, to be exact…so technically 8x more expensive than Illiyoon!). I love that it doesn’t leave a greasy film so it works flawlessly under makeup AND it keeps me moisturized all day!",

I left for several years though and have only been recently posting here and there… I just felt like the sub was very stagnant, haul focused, and had stopped aligning with science but rather arbitrary skincare rules.\n\nWhile my interest in skincare hasn’t gone anywhere and I’ve moved onto other platforms (and even started creating my own content and am thankful to those who came before me like Lab Muffin and Fiddh Snails), this sub just lost its shine for me. While I’m not sure fully why and we all outgrow things, there are a few things that stick out:\n\n-  the ridiculous and rigid skincare rules at the time when it came to wait times, pH adjusting toners, and other nonsense.\n\n- redundant skincare steps and ingredients, no real attention to formulation of products, and just cookie cutter 12 step routines for everyone\n\n- the focus on just immediately doing all these hauls and testing everything under the sun rather than determining skin type and concerns as well as what would be best for that then starting with the basic skincare steps first and so forth  \n\n- not adapting Korean and Japanese skincare products into existing Western routines which meant the products couldn’t help with more serious concerns like acne, hyper pigmentation, photoaging, etc\n\nTL;DR I still love Korean and Japanese skincare. I just utilize a lot of hydrating and anti inflammatory toners and essences, barrier focused moisturizers, and sunscreens from AB alongside proven topicals like tretinoin, azelaic acid, and Vitamin C here in the states. I think you get the best of both worlds that way.\n\nI also just spent a long time on furthering my education in terms of formulation, ingredients, the evidence on skincare, etc and am much better for it.",

Doing that research inspired me to make this post.\n\nFirstly, Lancome is owned by L'oreal.  An example of research that L'oreal has done is with stem cells and [the first L'oreal brand product that benefited from that is Lancome's Absolue Precious Cells](http://www.loreal.com/research-innovation/push-back-the-boundaries-of-knowledge/the-revelation-of-stem-cells.aspx).  In fact, [Lancome is a L'oreal Luxe brand](http://www.loreal.com/Brands.aspx?topcode=CorpTopic_Brand).  \n\nThere is no guarantee that the L'oreal products work exactly the same as the Lancome products, as there tends to be less of the specialized ingredients in the L'oreal products and that there tends to be some variation of other ingredients in the products.  An example of this is that in Lancome's Vissionaire serum, there is [4% of the LR2412 molecule](http://www.lancome-usa.com/Visionnaire/1000680,default,pd.html?start=1&q=visionnaire&cgid=skincare_visionnaire&cm_vc=search) while L'oreal's Youth Code Texture Perfector Serum Concentrate has [2% of the LR2412 molecule](http://www.lorealparisusa.com/en/Products/Skin-Care/Treatments/Youth-Code-Texture-Perfector-Serum-Concentrate.aspx).  So here is the list I have compiled up:\n\n**Eye Products:**\n\n* Absolue Eye Premium Bx is similar to L’oreal’s Age Perfect Eye Cream\n* Rénergie is similar to L’oreal’s Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Golden Balm Eye\n* High Résolution Eye Refill - 3X is similar to L’oreal’s RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream\n\n\n**Treatments and Serums:**\n\n* Vissionaire is similar to L’oreal’s Youth Code Texture Perfector\n* Génefique Cream Serum (as serum) is similar to L’oreal’s Youth Code Serum Intense\n* Génefique Eye Light-Pearl is similar to L’oreal’s Youth Code Youth Regenerating Skincare Eye Cream\n\n**Moisturizers:**\n\n* Bienfait Aqua Vital Cream, Bienfait Aqua Vital Lotion, & Bienfait Multi-Vital Night is similar to L’oreal’s Ideal Moisture Even Skin Tone All Skin Types Day/Night Cream\n* High Résolution Refill - 3X is similar to L’oreal’s RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Face & Neck Contour Cream\n* Nutrix Royal & Nutrix is similar to L’oreal’s Hydra-Renewal Continuous Moisture Cream\n* Rénergie Cream is similar to L’oreal’s Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Golden Balm Face, Neck & Chest\n* Rénergie Lift Multi-Action Night Cream & High Résolution Night Refill - 3X are similar to L’oreal’s RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle & Firming Night Cream\n* Génefique Repair Youth Activating Night Cream & Génefique Cream Serum (as moisturizer) is similar to L’oreal’s Youth Code Youth Regenerating Skincare Day/Night Cream\n\n**Makeup Removers/Cleanser:**\n\n* Effacil is similar to L’oreal’s Clean Artiste 100% Oil-Free Eye Makeup Remover\n* Bifacil is similar to L’oreal’s Clean Artiste Waterproof & Long Wearing Eye Makeup Remover\n* Absolue Premium BX is similar to L’oreal’s RevitaLift Radiant Smoothing Cream Cleanser\n* Lancome Eau Micellaire Douceur is similar to Skin Perfection 3 in 1 Purifying Micellar Solution (available in some non-U.S. markets).\n    * Lancome Eau Micellaire Douceur\n        \n        **aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Poloxamer 184,** Dihydrocholeth-30, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Benzyl Salicylate, Propylene Glycol, **Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Disodium EDTA,** Rosa Gallica Extract, Parfum.\n\n   * L'oreal Paris Skin Perfection 3 in 1 Purifying Micellar Solution\n\n        **aqua, hexylene glycol, glycerin, poloxamer 184, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, disodium EDTA,** polyaminopropyl biguanide.\n\n\nFor my sources to figure out L'oreal products that are similar to Lancome products, I use ingredient lists and product descriptions on L'oreal's website as well as Lancome's website.  If I could not find an ingredient list on either of those websites, I used Cosdna.  \n\nI hope this list was/is able to help some of you awesome people out.\n\nEDIT 1: added another product to the Makeup Removers/Cleanser section that nihilcupio gave in the comments.

Notable point is, since that post, I've learned that cetearyl alcohol is not fungal-safe, and switched to using https://folliculitisscout.com as an ingredient checker since I find it up to date, with that ingredient flagged. if any of you want to check if a product is fungal-safe - that's the website I personally use ☺️ If you want a detailed rundown of how and why these ingredients affect our skin, I highly reccomend the SimpleSkincareScience website - [Their Fungal Acne Treatment Bible post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) is very thorough and cites sources ❤️\n\n[My current routine in 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/uwmvkk/my_current_2022_fungalsafe_skincare_routine_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (more or less) with some haircare.\n\nThese are not recommendations, they're just useful information - some products have reviews linked, but please do use ✨️the search bar✨️ as well as other sources to check out other reviews, and make an informed purchase  ☺️\n\n**Disclaimer:** These products are not guaranteed to suit anybody. It's just that ingredients that are known triggers for seb derm or fungal acne - like plant oils, esters, fatty acids, etc. - are absent in these products. They may not suit your skin for other reasons. YMMV.\n\n**They will not treat malassezia related conditions**, they're intended as options for those who want to use a fungal-safe routine, to prevent flare-ups and maintain their skin.\n\nIF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MAY BE SUFFERING FROM ONE OF THESE CONDITIONS, PLEASE SEEK MEDICAL GUIDANCE FROM A DERMATOLOGIST. These products are not a substitute for medical treatment.\n\n#✨️ First cleansers/makeup removers\n\n+ Solimo Micellar Water\n\n+ Garnier Naturals Micellar Water (the pink one)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil (plain pink original formula - does not emulsify, but can be used to dissolve and wipe off sunscreen/makeup, and followed up with a foaming cleanser)\n\n#✨️ Foaming cleansers\n\n+ Sebamed Clear Face Cleansing Foam\n\n+ Simple Kind to Skin Refreshing Face Wash\n\n+ Kaya Clinic Soothing Cleansing Gel\n\n+ Deconstruct Niacinamide Brightening Face Wash - 2% Niacinamide+2% Liquorice Root Extract\n\n+ Deconstruct Salicylic Acid Oil Control Face Wash - 0.5% Salicylic Acid +1% Niacinamide [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/y3ynhi/review_deconstruct_salicylic_acid_oil_control/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=2&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Deconstruct Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Face Wash - 0.5% Amino Acids + 0.1% Hyaluronic Acid\n\n+ Body Cupid Deep Clarifying Face Wash (with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E) \n\n+ Body Cupid Tea Tree and Neem Anti Acne Face Wash (with Tea Tree Oil & Neem Extract) \n\n+ Body Cupid Vitamin C Brightening Face Wash (with Fruit Extract of Kakadu Plums) \n\nAll the Body Cupid face washes appear to be fungal-safe, but the ones I left out have \"menthol crystals\" and \"strawberry microbeads\" in, respectively, so... wouldn't recommend, even in theory 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\n+ Bliscent Lychee & Sea Buckthorn Face Wash\n\n+ Himalaya Purifying Neem Face Wash (tube, not foaming pump)\n\n+ Himalaya Tan Removal Orange Face Wash (not the scrub)\n\n+ DermaCo 2% Cica-Glow Daily Face Wash with Tranexamic Acid & Licorice Extract (contains something called \"Gillet-C\", which I cannot find as an ingredient anywhere, but seems to have something to do with vitamin C?)\n\n+ Mamaearth Charcoal Face Wash (with activated charcoal and coffee)\n\n+ Clean & Clear Natural Bright Face Wash\n\n+ Re'equil Fruit AHA Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Rejusure 2% Salicylic Acid Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/th4u4s/review_rejusure_2_salicylic_acid_face_wash/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Zitclin Zitcare Foam Face Wash (2% salicylic acid in a \"gel base q.s. containing aloe vera\".

Sugarcane squalane is considered fungal-safe. Olive squalane is variable - some people with malassezia use it with zero issues, some find it aggravates their condition. I've mentioned the source of the squalane in these products whenever I've been able to find that info.\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you are dealing with active seb derm/fungal acne and want to be on the safe side, best to avoid products containing mineral oil, liquid paraffin or Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather - even too much MCT oil - can lead to oil and heat building up and cause flare-ups. Less is more.\n\n+ Body Cupid 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel (OG Aloe gel for me.

People have asked me how I choose one, and having looked at the available brands on Amazon, I can say that the brands Sharrets, Carbamide Forte and Growfit appear to be C8+C10 only, so they're suitable. \n\nThe brands Laurin and Kayos, for example, also contain C12, which is lauric acid - NOT fungal-safe. The brand Simyl is available in chemists and very cheap, but it's meant to be a weight gain supplement for infants, and is not fungal-safe. That's about all there is to look out for when purchasing, the rest is trial, even for me ☺️\n\n+ Aiwo MCT C8 Oil (unfortunately the only C8 oil I can find, only available  in a 500ml bottle for around 2000 bucks)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil with Vitamin E (the original, plain one) - just mineral oil with vitamin E and added fragrance\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you want to be on the safe side, best to avoid mineral oil, liquid paraffin and Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather, even too much MCT oil, can lead to oil and heat building and cause flare-ups. Less is more, and if using mineral oil, a literal drop or two may be enough.\n\n+ Plain mineral oil/liquid paraffin - available at chemists. Not sure if it's less refined than the baby oil, but it's far cheaper (as it should be baby products are marked up like crazy) and has no fragrance\n\n+ Boroline/Boroline Night Repair Cream (waterless balm - same ingredients list, contains lanolin - not vegan - which may not suit some people's skin)\n\n+ Good old plain Vaseline \n\n+ Minimalist 100% Squalane (olive squalane, which works for some people with fungal issues and breaks some people out 🙃)\n\n+ Indulgeo Quench – 100% Sugarcane Squalane\n\n+ Indulgeo Squalane (70% olive, 30% sugarcane)\n\n+ PURITO Plainet Squalane Oil (sugarcane squalane, which is fungal-safe for sure.

    "body": "Here is [a link to a Google Slides deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQUVf2nYRK3W1zTNe-wcgny_d4FGcdIpUKQnBV0ov6b6D3JeLQ5G8AUG9m_ajHVtqmutbo2YqhezFCw/pub?start=true&loop=false&delayms=15000) that goes over most of the important images and details (here is [basically the same content](https://imgur.com/gallery/jBjzxCc) in imgur, but a little harder to see, imo.) If you want a little more analysis and detail, read below.\n\nIn brief, I have Alden tan calf, Red Wing Teak Featherstone, Brown Chromexcel and Veg-tan that I have been exposing to the elements and bending; conditioning infrequently, regularly or not at all, to see the long term effect of conditioner on leather.\n\n**Bottom line up front:** Just about any conditioner has an impact. Potent conditioners prevent or reduce drying and cracking and mild conditioners help some compared to doing nothing. Using mild conditioners more helps more. Leather that doesn’t need to be conditioned may look worse if it gets conditioned. And since this test is now over, my wife will no longer say things to me like, “Oh, look! *Regrettable Husband* magazine came in the mail. You're on the cover. ‘What weird thing is he doing now!?’, it says.”\n\n**Details**\n\nAbout two years ago I started a test to see what affect conditioners had on leather over the long term. The Real Test is veg tan leather (sometimes called saddle leather or skirting leather) because I know that’s a lightly tanned leather that is most likely to benefit from conditioner. I sourced a few other leather samples with help and suggestions from the reddit community. Alden Tan Calf because calf is likely to need conditioner. Red Wing Featherstone because why not. Horween Chromexcel because why not. Those gave some interesting results, but the main data is from the veg tan. I chose three conditioners to apply in frequent and infrequent intervals—Venetian Leather Balm because there’s debate about whether it’s a conditioner at all; it’s about as mild a conditioner as I know of. Neatsfoot oil, which is about as *potent* a conditioner as I know of. And Esquire Leather Conditioner, which is between the other two and I believe is a colloidal suspension of oil, similar to most commercial conditioners.\n\nI kept one strip of each of the four leathers in a drawer and kept one strip of each type of leather un-treated. The rest got either frequent (7 or 8 times in two years) or infrequent (three times in two years) treatments with the three conditioners.\n\nFor the first eight months or so, I was regimented about how the board with all the strips on it was exposed to water, sun and flexing. After eight months, the going was slow and I was developing an unhealthy Wilson-in-*Castaway* relationship with the board, so I basically just left it outside all the time for a year. Recently, while flexing it, I noticed cracking on the untreated veg tan strip and took a closer look at all of the samples. I took them off the board, brushed them and set them side-by-side for a comparison.\n\n**Results**\n\nUntreated veg tan leather very clearly cracked the most. It was very cracked. Strips treated *infrequently* with VSC or Esquire have modest cracking that’s obvious upon close inspection. Strips treated *frequently* with either mild conditioner *did not crack.* Strips treated with Neatsfoot oil didn’t crack; neatsfoot treated strips also remained hyrdrated, plump and flexible. There is a very clear and satisfying trend: *strips that received less conditioner cracked more* *and looked worse*. When I excitedly explained this to my wife, she said I sounded like a seven year old girl talking about why Twilight Sparkle is better than Rainbow Dash.\n\nThe trend isn’t as obvious with the other leathers. Combination-tanned Chromexcel looks worse when it was treated with Neatsfoot. It looks over-conditioned. Chromexcel may not need a lot of conditioner, but Venetian made it glow a bit and look more appealing.\n\nBoth of the chrome-tanned leathers physically held up well, but they look like the life has been drained from them. Perhaps the chromexcel killed them and absorbed their power. Neatsfoot made them a little more flexible and Venetian made them a little less blotchy and a little more shiny. If you look at the pictures, lightly conditioned veg-tan are obviously the ugliest strips in the test. But veg tan looks like it can be maintained with proper care. The way *every* chrome-tanned strip looks makes me question whether I want to buy any chrome tanned leather.\n\n**Thoughts**\n\nI didn’t know what to expect but I’m delighted to see such an obvious trend. This must be how astronauts feel the first time they see the Earth from space. I picked three potencies of conditioner and applied them at two levels of treatments and I saw a really clear dose-dependent result. Conditioner works and it does so in a concentration dependent way.\n\nI’m surprised that Venetian Leather Balm had a more than cosmetic effect. Since it doesn’t darken much at all, I really like it as a product. Personally, I’m going to keep using Obenauf’s Oil for things that I KNOW need to be conditioned badly. I’m going to use Bick #4 from time to time when conditioner is needed but maybe not as much as Obenauf’s would do. I’m going to use Saphir Renovateur on my calf and shell stuff. I’m going to use VSC on scuffs and things I want to add a shine to without any risk of over conditioning.\n\nIf I was doing it over again, I’d replace Esquire with Bick #4. Esquire doesn’t seem to soak in well to any of these leathers, making it effectively less potent than I expected… which might be a feature, not a bug. There should be a Hippocratic Oath for conditioner: first, do no harm.\n\nIf I was doing it over again, I’d replace the Alden and Red Wing leathers with: Bridle leather, shell, and veg tanned calf. And I might add a chrome tanned leather with big pull up.\n\nLink to [eight month update](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/fdva8h/long_term_conditioner_test_eight_month_update/); [14-month update](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/iv7ifd/long_term_conditioner_test_14_month_update/); [20-month update](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/mc9y9f/long_term_conditioner_test_20_month_update/).\n\nLink to my short-term conditioner test [part-one](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/cl4l2n/short_term_conditioner_test_blackrock_leather/), [part-two](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/d5ghp1/short_term_conditioner_test_2_bick_4_chamberlain/), [part-three](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/d92wbr/short_term_conditioner_test_3cracking_prevention/)  \n\n\n**Update one month later.**  \nAfter the conclusion, I wanted to see if conditioner could \"rescue\" leather that looked bad at the end of the test. I treated the no-treatment veg-tan control with a liberal application of neatsfoot oil. As you'd expect, it feels less dry and *maybe* it's 5% less awful feeling and rigid, but it's no more rescued than praying for the leather would do.\n\nWith another of the veg tan strips that was very lightly conditioned, I followed [this protocol](https://vcleat.com/glycerin-leather-conditioning/), leaving a strip wrapped in a paper towel in a zip lock bag along with one tablespoon of glycerin and two tablespoons of water. The results were interesting, approaching dramatic. [Very short album here](https://imgur.com/a/yMFv8j1).\n\nThe glycerin treated strip didn't feel or look as healthy as the strip that had received neatsfoot conditioning from the beginning, but it was far more pliable and it looked hydrated and less like zombie leather. I could bend the curled up, dry edges back to their original shape without cracking the surface.\n\nI would not put glycerin anywhere near leather items I value. But if I had some extremely dry and certain-to-crack leather in my possession and it was a choice between throwing it away or following [this ethanol plus glycerin preservation protocol](https://nautarch.tamu.edu/CRL/conservationmanual/File7.htm), I would probably give it a try.\n\n&#x200B;",

Easy pace around 5:40-5:20min/km\n\nOkay so I needed a new easy/long distance shoe, had the magmax and glycerin max in my list the vomero being the last option ... I needed new shoes for this weekend long run Wich consisted in a super easy 20km run (6:00/km-5:40/km) as I was pacing a friend on his longest distance for his first marathon. The only easy/max cushion shoe on my size in my local running store were the vomero 18. I tried them on expecting nothing and they felt amazing so I pulled the trigger.\n\nUpper: it felt quite thick with the padded tounge and was a bit concerned about how much breathability they had as I live in an extremely hot a humild coastal city in mexico (30°c with 85+humidity at 6am), during the 2 hour run they felt great with no overheating Wich was a pleasant surprise, fit wise they felt a bit snug for my wide fit when I first lace them up but when running I didn't notice that snug fit anymore. So upper was better than expected\n\nMidsole: man they really blew me away, the balance of zoom X and react X is perfect at least for me, I had to pick up the pace during this 20km run up to 4:30/km and they felt unexpectedly responsive, but of course this Is no workout shoe. When I cruised in around 6min/km they felt also amazing highly protective and the geometry kept me rolling effortlessly.\n\nOutsole: no complains and felt quite good all tho I did notice a it of wear for justo 20km.\n\nConclusions: highly recommend this shoe , felt amazing at slow paces and good when I picked up the pace a bit. I've seen reviews saying they need more stack on the forefoot but I don't think that's the case with this shoe, previously owning the invincible 1 and 3 I did felt that those shoes needed more on the forefoot. I'm excited to give this shoes another spin and add more km to them ! ",

    "body": "It wasn’t even snowing when I left for work but by the time I was halfway there, the roads were coated in ice. People were sliding around like real-life bumper cars and there were accidents blocking every path to the office. With all roads blocked, I decided to just give up and turn for home.\n\n\nI was being cautious, creeping along in my little Echo at about 15 miles per hour. Down the road a stretch, I spotted a Toyota truck coming towards me around a curve, fast. He had to be going at least 70 miles per hour. He seemed, at first, to be flying by on my left. Then, he was sliding sideways in a long, silver smear.\n\n\nIt’s true that time slows down when you are about to die. I saw the clock click from 7:25 to 7:26. I looked at my hands, noticing every vein, every line. Heard the words of the Imogen Heap song I was listening to, “Where are we? What the hell is going on?\" I thought, “I can get out of this.\" Looked right: cement utility pole, ditch, looked left: silver pickup truck. I thought, “I *really* can’t get out of this.\"  I saw particles of dust seeming to glow, suspended, in the air.\n\n\nThen there was crunching and spinning and glass and spinning and *pain* and then - suddenly darkness.\n\n\nI was alone in the darkness for a while, and then I wasn’t alone. Darkness, heavy but awake, consuming me. I somehow *was* the darkness, and yet I was still very much myself. Or, I should say, I recognized myself in the darkness. Then I heard a rush of whispers and long low whistles. As the sounds grew louder, waves became particles and two forms started to appear. Mine, and hers. A shifting, swirling woman was standing in front of me. Like blowing smoke into a sunbeam that’s coming through a gap in the curtains. Smoke all around, but only seen as it swirls through the sunbeam. She was like that. I could see that she had shoulder length brown hair, and she was wearing a light blue shirt and white pants. She appeared to be rather tall, but not as tall as me. I was watching her patterns shift and swirl when she spoke.\n\n\n“Olivia?”\n\n\n“I’m...I...yes, I... Who are you?\" Not too eloquent, but that’s what I said.\n\n\n“You can think of me as Mora.\" I could hear her, even though her mouth wasn’t making noise when she spoke.\n\n\n“How...?” I gestured around us at the endless, swirling black.\n\n\n“Everything is happening at once. All at once, right now. The leading edge is the same as the very end of the line,\" she answered. The more she spoke, the more she seemed to be slowly unraveling.\n\n\n“I don’t know what that means.\"\n\n\n“That’s ok.\"\n\n\n“But, I mean, what’s going on?\" I was getting dizzy trying to focus on her as she shifted in and out of form. It was making me impatient.\n\n\n“The universe itself is afraid of its own end. Consciousness in form is the universe's way of awakening to its own immortality. In the silence of the void, there is a voice. The voice *listening to itself*. The voice *realizing it IS the void*, and the void is alive. There is circle after circle of understanding. Do you understand?\"\n\n\n“No.\"\n\n\n“That’s ok.\"\n\n\nI waited for her to say something else, but she was silent. She was evaporating into a horizontal mist. Looking down I saw that I was starting to do the same.\n\n\n“Why are you telling me these things?\" I asked, distracted again by the swirling particles.\n\n\n“Because we need you. So I need you to wake up.\"\n\n\nAs soon as she said, “wake up,” I felt myself being pulled like a yo-yo on a string. Snapping backwards in the darkness. I watched my own particles blowing away from me like dust. Leaving a mist trail in what appeared to be a long, dark tunnel. Then the darkness shifted to the familiar darkness that lives behind my eyes. I felt my body, my real solid body, and then I felt the pain. Next, I noticed I was suffocating. Warm, humid, air was breathing itself for me through a respirator. I must have started to flail around in my panic because I was given a shot and then I fell asleep.\n\n\n\nWhen I woke up again, the doctor told me I lost consciousness after impact. I was rushed to surgery for internal injuries. Apparently I 'died' on the operating table. They \"shocked me back\" and put me on life support. The accident broke my sternum, three ribs, my right knee, and resulted in severe closed head trauma. Because of my internal injuries, they had to remove a nice chunk of bowel. I mimed, “I want to write\", by using a finger to scribble over the opposite palm. The doctor pulled a pad and pen out of his pocket and handed it to me. His eyes were a dusty shade of blue, the color of cornflowers. \n\n\n“When can I go back to work\"? I wrote.\n\n\n“That’s tricky\", he said. “We’ve left you with essentially what we’d call short gut syndrome which can result in intermittent incontinence. Head injuries such as yours often result in severe migraines. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves though. You’re going to get stronger every day, I promise. Let’s get you off this respirator and take it one step a time. Sound good?” No. It did not sound good. With no family of my own, my job was my life. Still, I nodded. What else was there to do?\n\n\nI was on the respirator for two more warm, wet, and suffocating days, then I was moved to the room that would be my home for the next seven weeks.\n\n\nA few days after moving to the new room, I was lying on my bed, feeling loopy from the morphine drip and thinking about drinking orange juice. The cup was just out of reach on my bedside table. I remember feeling a wave of injustice and anger come over me. Not about the accident, or my injuries, or being stuck in a hospital unable to work, possibly forever. No. I was angry about not being able to reach the orange juice. I was fucking furious at the orange juice. I was glaring at it, with everything I had, and then- BOOM! It exploded. Orange juice flying absolutely everywhere.\n\n\nThat was the first time I used my mind to blow something up. Honestly, it was exhilarating. I spent the next seven weeks popping gauze pads, glycerin swabs, any little thing that wouldn’t make too much of a mess.\n\n\nThe first person I looked up after I got out of the hospital was the driver of the silver Toyota. He was picked up for felony reckless driving, but let go on a technicality. I did some digging. I was a paralegal before my injuries forced me to take long-term disability so I knew my way around court documents. It also didn’t hurt that I was good friends with a few of the clerks at court. It turns out I wasn’t the first person he’d seriously hurt. His connections just kept finding him loopholes to skip through.\n\n\n\nI decided I should find him in person. Maybe this guy just looked bad on paper? Maybe he’d apologize? I was hoping for any redeeming quality. Nope. When I told him who I was he laughed and said, “were you this ugly before I hit you?” Then, he dropped to the floor, holding his head and screaming. He got what he deserved, a Subarachnoid Hemorrhage from an aneurysm exploding in his brain. Nasty things, those. So sad.\n\n\nThree days later, I let myself into my apartment only to find a man sitting at my dining room table. He was wearing an expensive looking suit and smoking a cigarette. He had obviously been there a while because smoke was swirling around him in a thick haze. I suppose I should have been shocked or terrified. The truth is I was expecting it.\n\n\n“Can I help you?”\n\n\nHe looked up from a mess of open folders and said, “Olivia, come here, I need you to take a look at this.”\n\n\nI blinked, hard, and then I walked over to the table.\n\n\n“Can I ask your name?”\n\n\n\n“Mr. W. Olivia, take a look at these pictures.” I looked over his shoulder at four open folders with pictures splayed out in piles. I can’t, no, I won’t, tell you what I saw the people in those pictures doing. Imagine for a moment the *worst* abuse to the most *innocent* of victims, and you might have a pretty good idea. \n\n\n“Olivia, What I have here is a four-way split video call. You’ll see that our agents have these four suspects in custody. Can you positively match the person on each screen to the pictures on the table in front of you?”\n\n\n\nI looked from the pictures to the screens one at a time. Carefully. There were three men and one woman. Each of the agents was wearing the same blue shirt and white pants Mora had worn.\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\nI haven’t mentioned my childhood, and I won’t go into detail about it. What I will say is that the woman on the screen bore a striking resemblance to my mother’s best friend, Marie. Same red hair, freckles, green eyes. Marie hurt me, just like the woman on the screen had hurt the child in the pictures spread across her file. The child who bore a striking resemblance to *me*: blonde hair, brown eyes, freckles. \n\n\n\n“Ok, Olivia. Please understand that these people have not been convicted of any crime. In fact, they aren’t being tried. These pictures were obtained illegally so they are not admissible in court. They are innocent until proven guilty. Do you understand?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n\nI looked back at the monitor and watched as each of them fell like marionettes being cut from their strings. One after the other, until all four were lying on the floor clutching their heads, screaming. \n\n\nMr. W looked up at me, his eyes squinting in a genuine smile. “Welcome to Moirai, Olivia. We are so happy to have you.\"\n\n\nThat was seven years ago. I’m 33 now, and I’m getting better every day. More precise. I’ve been practicing. Mr. W tells me that they will be needing me more than ever in the days to come. I’d ask you to wish me luck, but I don’t need it. I *have* been getting stronger every day. \n\nI’m strong enough now.\n\n\n",

There was also a weird addendum stating its just a random list of products and always reformulating check the packaging for up to date ingredients. Uh, what? So how would I do that, that sounds so sketchy and I just got a grossed out feeling. Give them Lala beauty? More like give them cancer beauty.\n\nEDIT: Lala claims her skincare is \"clean\" yet contains unclean ingredients and alcohol and fragrance among other things. Also apparently all sales are final. Meaning if you're allergic to glycerin or any of the ingredients and have a reaction you can't return them. Buyer beware. For her prices please just buy something actually clean. In order to call a product \"clean\" 6 different criteria need to be met and it's looking like she is just sticking the word clean on her skincare line.",
