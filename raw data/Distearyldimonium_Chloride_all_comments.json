They don't always appear as \"ceramide \\_\\_\", there are other names for them, such as:\n\nHydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, Myristoyl/​Palmitoyl Oxostearamide/​Arachamide MEA, Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide, Hydroxypalmitoyl Sphinganine, [Safflower Oil/​Palm Oil Aminopropanediol Esters](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/safflower-oil-palm-oil-aminopropanediol-esters), etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo today I wanted to make a list of products that are easily overlooked when searching for ceramide skincare, because many people are only looking for the word \"ceramide\".

Because with a brief look earlier I saw the Palmitamide MEA in it and thought it's one of the ceramides (the names are so similar haha!). However, today I saw incidecoder mentioning it as just a viscosity controlling ingredient (and I usually find them quite accurate), but more things came up where I saw something from mdedge [here](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/74188_main.pdf) stating \"Palmitamide MEA (PEA) is an important component of MimyX nonsteroidal cream, Dr. Smith said. PEA is an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties\" but this doctor has a consulting agreement with Stiefel Labs, which manufactures Physiogel. Also came across this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/) but it's testing a synthetic ceramide PC-104 in combination with other things like Palmitamide MEA, grapeseed extract etc. Plus, I remember reading an AMA from kindofstephen where he said \" I think most cosmetic companies would attribute patents as a marketing cost. Most novel patents I've seen in the cosmetic industry are to deal with delivery vehicles (like an airless soft container, etc)\". My takeaway is things can be patented even if they're not doing too much, because to consumers it seems like it's doing a lot? And now idk if this ingredient/Physiogel is any good as a ceramide cream or it's just a good plain heavy moisturiser.\n\nEdit: Realised this ingredient is present in Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume, along with SK-Influx, where it's described as \"Atoderm Intensive Baume quickly stops itching and reduces the urge to scratch thanks to its anti-itching dermatological active ingredient PEA\"\n\nMy understanding is Physiogel doesn't have any ceramides or cholesterol/phytosterols (looks like Zeroid uses phytosterols in place of cholesterol?), but has PEA as a fatty acid (skin similar ingredient), so it must be a good moisturiser but not an ideal-ratio ceramide moisturiser.",

    "body": "Hi all!  \n\n\nI am back with another skin conditions post. This one is on perioral dermatitis.   \n\n\nAdmittedly, when I began researching this, I knew zilch about PD except that it was acne-like breakouts around the mouth,  and as I began to research it, it seems that there isn't a whole lot that is known about it. Fortunately, it is a highly treatable condition that seems to overlap to a degree with rosacea (earning it the earlier name  of \"steroid rosacea\") and even seborrheic dermatitis.  \n\n\n**As always, please feel free to correct or inform me of anything wrong, and also feel free to post/discuss what helps your PD.**\n\n# What is Perioral Dermatitis\n\nPerioral dermatitis (PD) is a chronic, recurrant inflammatory disease that most commonly occurs in the perioral region of the face (the area around the mouth). It can also affect the area around the nose, and in roughly 20&#37; of cases, it can manifest around the eyes (though it goes by another name if around the eyes: peri-orificial dermatitis).   \n\n\nIt afflicts around 1&#37; of the population of the United States, particularly those with fair skin, and predominately occurs in women between 18-45, with 20s and 30s having peak incidence.   \n\n\nIt presents as small, red, tender, sometimes itchy bumps that can flake and burn. While commonly mistaken for acne, it is distinct from acne in that it only presents in specific locations, spares the small area around the lips, and lacks pustules (whiteheads).\n\n# Causes of Perioral Dermatitis\n\nThe causes of perioral dermatitis are unclear. It is a relatively \"young\" disease that was only first described as a distinct condition in 1964. It is first and foremost an inflammatory condition, and is aggravated by ingredients and habits that can create inflammation either in the skin or in the body. \n\nWhile I was researching PD, the one constant that showed up again and again is that it is aggravated by corticosteroid use -- both topical and inhaled. To specify, that means not just creams like kenalog, triamcinolone, and over-the-counter hydrocortisone, but also asthma inhalers (including Advair, Flovent, and ProAir aka Albuterol) and nasal allergy mists like Beconase, Flonase, Nasonex, Omnaris, and Veramyst. \n\nLess commonly, but still a factor to consider are hormones, where monthly shifts can put the condition into overdrive. More frustrating is that oral contraceptives can worsen PD in some. \n\nOther causes can be fluoridated toothpaste, high SPF value sunscreens¹, sunscreens with the filters zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, the ingredient \"isopropyl myristate,\" improperly removing makeup or sleeping in makeup, occlusive ointments (Vaseline, Aquaphor, and oils, for example), heavy creams with occlusive ingredients, and cold creams (wipe-off cleansing creams that leave a residue, like Pond's). In one case, a woman's favorite lip balm (containing the ingredient propyl gallate) caused her PD.⁶\n\n# Treatment\n\nPD can look like many other conditions, such as acne, angular cheilitis, rosacea, or seborrheic dermatitis, and requires treatment of a professional due to the inflammatory nature of the condition. \n\nThe most important thing for anyone suffering from PD is to discontinue steroid use - whether cold-turkey or weened off with the management of a healthcare professional. While topical steroids can seem to improve the condition, they frequently create a rebound effect, which can make the condition worse. \n\nOnce steroids are removed, the skin will get worse before getting better. This is the toughest part of PD for most people. Topical antibiotics or topical immunosuppresants (such as Pimecrolimus or Elidel) are frequently prescribed due to their tremendously  helpful anti-inflammatory effects on PD, and azelaic acid can prove useful in some cases. In very severe cases, oral antibiotics can be prescribed in addition to topicals. \n\nWhile healing from PD, the skin should not be cleansed with any cleanser, and makeup and skincare products should be avoided completely until the condition resolves. And no matter how tempting, PD should never be scrubbed, as this worsens the inflammation. \n\nOnce treated, it is encouraged to use liquid or gel sunscreens as well as soap-free cleansers that do not dry out the skin, as TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss) is significant in people who suffer from PD.\n\n# Long-Term Care\n\nSome people have PD once in their lives, while others may combat it on and off for several years. If you fall into the latter, it is important to try to avoid triggers that can cause the condition to reoccur (particularly steroid use). That means cleansing your skin each day with gentle cleansers, always removing makeup (removing it with a wipe does *NOT* count - you need to cleanse it away thoroughly with an oil cleanser that rinses cleanly), and using light products, particularly around the areas typically affected. \n\nPrescriptions like azelaic acid and over-the-counter .1&#37; adapalene (Differin)² may  also help to manage the condition in the long-term. \n\nI've put together a list below of some cleansers and moisturizers that are recommended for people suffering from PD. Again, like with my rosacea list, this is not a be-all-end-all list. None of the products listed contain isopropyl myristate or heavy occlusive ingredients.\n\n## Recommended Products\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser** \n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Stearyl Alcohol and Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate​,​ Polysorbate 60​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Panthenol​,​ T-Butyl Alcohol,​ Tocopherol​.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Wate/Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryl Glycol/Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**Avene Extremely Gentle Cleanser Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (avene Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Serine, Cetrimonium Bromide, Coco-Glucoside, Dipotassium Phosphate, Disodium Edta, Disodium Phosphate, O-Phenylphenol, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Water (Aqua).*\n\n**Spectro Jel Cleanser for Blemish-Prone Skin - Fragrance Free**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Hydroxypropyl Methocellulose, Polysorbate 20, Cetyl Alcohol (moisturizer), Hydrated Silica, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Diazolidinyl Urea, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Sorbitan Oleate.*\n\n## Foaming Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Terastearate, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric, Glycerides, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Sodium Chloride, Phytosphingosine, Citric Acid, Edetate Disodium, Dihydrate, Sodium, Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Olay Foaming Face Wash Sensitive**\n\n>*Ingredients: Water/Eau, Glycerin, Sodium Myristoyl Sarcosinate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Polyquaternium-10, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Laureth-10, Disodium Lauroamphodiacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, DMDM Hydantoin.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate​,​ PEG-120 Methyl Glucoside Dioleate,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Hydroxide​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Capryloyl Glycine​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Citric Acid​,​ Acrylates Copolymer​.*\n\n## Makeup Removers\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm**\n\n>*Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Polyethylene, PEG-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Water / Aqua / Eau, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol.*\n\n**Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Mineral Oil, PEG-8 Glyceryl Isostearate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclomethicone, Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Isostearic Acid, Glycerin, Phenoexyethanol.*\n\n## Moisturizers\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Ceteareth-20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Phosphate, Potassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben.*\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3-Diisosterate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide 1, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium phosphate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 20, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Active - Dimethicone, 1\\%.

        "body": "I’ve been diagnosed with Peri-orbital Dermatitis by my dermatologist. I’ve had it for at least 10 years. Peri-orbital means it presents around my eyes, nose and mouth. My worst flare ups cover all three areas, my most frequent flare ups present just around my nostrils. \n\nYes, you’re correct that causes are basically unknown. Successful treatments can vary wildly. \n\n(personally, I’m convinced it has a fungal element, specially related to candida imbalance. That’s just my opinion. I have used OTC topicalS and been prescribed anti-fungal topicals and pills, none of that worked. I believe it is related to gut microbiome health. Our skin is a direct reflection of what’s going on intrinsically in our bodies) \n\nI want chime in here about Zinc Oxide. You mention it as a possible cause. I want others out here to know that high concentration Zinc Oxide Cream is the ONLY thing that stops my flare ups. So if you have PD, I recommend patch testing a high ZO cream on one or two of the papules and see if it helps you. Incidentally, I’ve found recently that micronized ZO particles actually work faster for my than larger particles. So I stopped using Desitin Max strength and started using Neutrogena Sheer Zinc for face with 22% ZO. It stops my flare ups completely in a matter of a day or so, versus 4+ days with the Desitin. \n\nI’ll list below everything I’ve tried in case it’s helpful. The other product I find helpful is daily probiotic pills containing Lactobacillus Acidophilus. I get less flare ups when I take daily probiotics. \n\nDIDN’T WORK: \nAntibacterial Rx creams, I believe I had both Erythromycin and Dapsone. OTC antifungal creams, clotrimazole, miconazole and terbinafine. I also had an oral Rx for Lamisil, it was generic and I can’t recall the generic name. OTC topical steroids, hydrocortisone. Violet extract. Cutting out SLS from from my toothpaste and hair products. (I never cleansed with SLS, always either soap or oil) Changing my diet to an acne safe diet. Getting sun. Staying out of sun. Sulphur washes. Leaving it alone.",

I was prescribed Finacea and in one month the results have been astounding. Redness has significantly reduced and no closed comedones or inflamed pimples anywhere. Again mine wasn’t severe but for anyone who has it I think azelaic acid is a great choice. \n\nI should point out I never use steroids, I’m 30F and I think this was due to over moisturizing after over exfoliating. I also think the occlusive nature of aquaphor made it much worse. My routine now consists of nothing but cleanser, moisturizer and Finacea. Drastic change from what I was doing before. \n\nThank you for taking the time to post this very informative breakdown of perioral dermatitis.",

    "body": "**Skin type:** combination (oily nose and chin, dry everything), sensitive, acne and eczema prone.\n\n# Backstory: \n\nThis summer has been hell for my skin. Never had an eczema flare up on my face before, but yup it happened now. My eczema wasn't as severe as some of the other cases I'd read about, but it got pretty bad. My face itched constantly, I couldn't sleep at night, I felt like my face was cracking open. Went to the dermatologist and he prescribed some topical steroids, but I could only use them for upto 10 days, and the patches would just return when I stopped.\n\nI tried applying about 3 layers of the cetaphil moisturizer my dermat recommended, but that just made me itch more. My skin wouldn't allow more than 1 layer of that.\n\nAnyway, I decided to try out Aveeno dermexa because everyone said it would be good. And yup it was, not my HG product or anything, and I'm definitely on the lookout for better alternatives, but I'm super thankful because my face is in control now.\n\nJust to clarify- I wasn't looking for something to make my eczema vanish, I just wanted some relief until I could get an allergy test done and find out the cause. This did the job pretty well.\n\n# General details about the product:\n\n* Has colloidal oatmeal, ceramides and avenanthramides. \n* Clinically proven to provide relief from 5 signs of dry skin : redness, itching, scaling, tightness and roughness. (Lives upto claims)\n* Formulated to minimize risk of allergies.\n* Fragrance and essential oil free.\n\n# Full ingredient list: \n\nAqua, Glycerin, Panthenol, Distearyldimonium Chloride, Petrolatum, Isopropyl Palmitate, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Avena Sativa Kernel Flour, Avena Sativa Kernel Extract, Avena Sativa Kernel Oil, Ceramide 3, Isopropyl Alcohol, Steareth-20, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Sorbate, Benzalkonium Chloride.\n\n**Price :** Rs.990 for 200ml.\n\n# Texture and smell: \n\nIt doesn't feel heavy on the skin and absorbs pretty quickly. Still, I would not recommend for oiler skin types for obvious reasons. It has a very rice-y smell? It's pretty nice, whatever it is.\n\n# My face skin routine:\n\nWash face with Cetaphil cleanser, then apply Cetaphil moisturizing cream (not DAM) on damp skin. Apply a layer of Aveeno dermexa. Wait for 15 minutes, then use Rx required nadifloxacin 1% cream on acne.\n\n# Good results:\n\n* My itching calmed down significantly. It isn't completely gone, but I've only used it for about 5 days, and it says on the back that results in 4 weeks, so I'll have to wait more I guess. Promising results till now though.\n* My redness went down too. It's still there, but reduced a lot. \n* Skin feels more plump and moisturized, scaling decreased a lot too. \n* Skin feels more healthy, isn't as dull as it was before. \n\n# Bad results:\n\n* I got a few pimples on my forehead and nose. These are my regular spots though, and I just got my period (was irregular this time) - so the breakout might not be due to the product. Irregular cycles always aggravate my acne. I'll have to see after my period gets over. **I don't think its due to the product, because my acne doesn't feel itchy or any different than usual.**\nEDIT : aveeno dermexa was not the cause for the pimples, I can confidently say that now.\n\n* It isn't heavy on the skin, and no visible cast either - but it feels a little uncomfortable if I'm under the sun. \n\n# Would I repurchase? Yes. Until I find something better, this is my best bet.\n\n**I definitely would recommend this to people with dry, irritated and/or sensitive skin.**",

You just need to check ingredients for things like drying alcohols, fragrance, irritating essential oils and any other irritants you know off.

Purely for anti aging, I don’t have any issues with breakouts apart from a random zit here and there. \n\nMy method of application has always been: wash face in the PM, apply moisturiser, wait 1 hour and then apply tret all over face and neck. Patting excess under eyes. \n\nGreat results so far but I always got the same irritation: major flaky skin around my mouth and nostrils and dry skin under the eyes. And a general dry/tightness until I woke up and moisturised/sunscreened.\n\nI bought the Aveeno Skin Relief 24 hour moisturizing lotion because my body skin is super dry from the winter/central heat. Last week I used it in place of my regular night time facial moisturizer (purito unscented) because I liked the texture and WOW. Within a week my skin is flake free, calm, takes so much better to tret AND is super moisturized. Like I wake up and my skin looks dewy (slightly oily) and freshly moisturized instead of dry, flaky and tight. \n\nI apply a little extra dot under my eyes just before bed (like a tret sandwich) and my under eye skin looks plump and concealer doesn’t fall into any dry lines anymore.\n\nI’m in love!! I’m kicking myself for trying other more expensive options when a body cream is apparently what my skin wanted.\n\nWord to the wise - this is silicone/petrolatum based which my skin happens to love but I’m sure will not agree with others, particularly if you have acne. It can also pill but I’ve had no issues if I apply my curology on top and then pat in.\n\nMy next step will be to try applying my tret directly onto freshly washed skin and then this moisturizer on top after 30 mins. I definitely couldn’t do that before without some irritation/flaking issues on the 4th/5th consecutive day.\n\nIngredients: Active Ingredient Dimethicone (1.2%) Purpose Skin Protectant Inactive Ingredients Water, Glycerin, Distearyldimonium Chloride, Petrolatum, Isopropyl Palmitate, Cetyl Alcohol, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Flour, Benzyl Alcohol, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Oil, Steareth-20, Sodium Chloride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract",

    "body": "Deep conditioning is a best practice to incorporate into your hair routine. Even if you feel your hair is not damaged, deep conditioners still help maintain healthy looking hair over time. Choosing how often to deep condition and which products to use can be a challenge. Deep conditioners go by many names, but are often thicker and heavier in their ingredient concentration.\n\n(This is the entire text from my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-deep-conditioning-your-hair.html))\n\n**What hair types and styles need deep conditioning?**\n\n* Long hair that feels dry\n* Chemically altered hair (examples: hair that has been lightened, permed, relaxed)\n* Naturally dry hair\n* [Damaged hair](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---damage.html)\n* [Hair with frizz](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---frizz.html)\n* Swimmers that expose their hair to chlorine often\n* Beach lovers with sun-bleached hair\n* People with hard water, or who use well water\n* Anyone who frequently uses high heat to style their hair (ex: flat iron)​\n\n**What is the goal of a deep conditioning treatment for hair?**  \n​The two goals here are (1) hydration and (2) slip. Both help with the appearance and overall longevity of your hair's strands.   \n\n\nHydration\n\n* Silky, flexible strands (versus dry, brittle ones) with more shine\n* Smooth ends (versus puffy and frayed)\n* On curly hair - curls that form evenly (versus inconsistently)\n\nSlip\n\n* Reduces [tangling](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-ii---tangles.html)\n* Reduces friction from [traction damage](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---damage.html) (to help hair grow)\n* Reduces[ frizz](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---frizz.html)\n\n**How often should I deep condition?**  \nThis is unique to each person's hair type. Deep conditioning bi-monthly or monthly is common. If your hair is damaged, you can deep condition up to once a week. For more insights on how to fit deep conditioning into your routine, check out my post on [Hair Schedules](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-schedules.html).\n\n**What are the best ingredients for deep conditioners?**  \nBelow I've shared common ingredients you'll find in conditioner and/or deep conditioners. It's helpful to know what these ingredients are in case a company doesn't use the term \"deep conditioner\" on the product label. Other terms used for deep conditioning-related products are:  hair treatment, hair tonic, hair lotion and hair masque. You can also check out my post on [Hair Oils](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-oils.html) for more insights on ingredient lists.\n\n* Panthenol\n* Glycerin\n* Amino Acids\n* Peptides\n* Cetyl alcohol or cetyl alcohol\n* Hydrolyzed proteins (ex: wheat, soy, keratin protein)\n* Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine\n* Quaternium-87\n* Behentrimonium Methosulfate\n* Behentrimonium Chloride\n* Dicetyldimonium Chloride\n* Distearyldimonium Chloride\n* Polyquaternium 55\n* Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride \n* Polyquaternium-44 \n* Cetrimonium Bromide\n* Cetrimonium Chloride\n* Palmitamidopropyltrimonium Chloride\n* Laurdimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed \n* Polyquaternium-4\n* Polyquaternium-10\n\n**How should you deep condition your hair?**  \nI've listed the process I recommend to my clients to help them get the best hydration and slip below.\n\n* Shampoo twice with clarifying shampoo, or use a regular shampoo plus a detox treatment, and rinse well.\n* Ring out most of the water from your hair, and/or soak it up with a towel.\n* Apply conditioner or deep conditioner from roots-to-ends.\n* Massage conditioner and water into your hair. Good coverage equals a better result. This can look like a combination of the techniques below. You can read more about the squeezing and scrunching technique [here](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a37304107/squish-to-condish/) in Cosmopolitan.\n   * untangling\n   * working in sections\n   * pressing root to tip\n   * gentle squeezing\n   * scrunching\n   * combing\n   * gathering all the hair together​\n* Let the deep conditioner sit for between 10-20 minutes on thicker hair or 5 - 10 minutes on finer hair.\n* Dunk hair in water using a sink or cup, or just quickly rewet in the shower.\n* Use the techniques listed above to press more water into the hair.\n* Do a final rise. On drier hair, this can be a quick rinse that leaves more conditioner residue. On finer hair, you'll want to do a more thorough rinse to prevent the deep conditioner from weighing your hair down. \n* Add leave-in products.\n* End with drying and/or styling  method of your choice:\n   * ​Air dry (avoid this method if it will take more than one hour to dry)\n   * Diffuse or blowdry with cold air\n   * Diffuse or blowdry with hot air and [heat protection](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-protecting-your-hair-from-heat-damage.html)\n\n**Can you over-condition hair?**  \nIf you are experiencing hair that appears:\n\n* limp, flat or heavy\n* to have build up or residue\n* straighter than you'd like\n* greasy or too shiny\n\nthen you could be over-conditioning. Try cutting back on the amount of deep conditioning treatments in your routine, switching conditioners to one that is for volume, or lightly shampooing after you condition.

    "body": "Okay. I love the Micro-Refinishing Cream so I decided to try a cream cleanser by Olay. I actually had a sample bottle of the Walgreen's generic version of Olay Regenerist Regenerating Cream Cleanser and although it had *Sodium Lauryl Sulfate* I gave it a go anyway. Overall I actually liked it, though I hadn't planned on getting anymore. Because I had decent results with this cleanser my mother purchased some more for me, but she got the Equate beauty Regenerating Daily Cream Cleanser, which is the Walmart generic of Olay Regenerist Regenerating Cream Cleanser (it says RIGHT on the bottle). However, the ingredient list is NOT the same as Olay's. \n\nWalmart Generic: *Purified Water, Ppg-15 Stearyl Ether, Stearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Oxidized Polyethylene, Salicylic Acid, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Distearyldimonium Chloride, Stearth-2, Steareth-21, Ppg-30, Behenyl Alcohol, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Seed Powder, Sodium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5), Fragrance, Disodium Edta, Sodidum Ascorbyl Phosphate, Carnosine.*\n\n\nOlay Regenerist Regenerating Cream Cleanser: *Water, PPG-15 Stearyl Ether, Glycerin, Oxidized Polyethylene, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Betaine, Salicylic Acid, Distearyldimonium Chloride, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cetyl Alcohol, Alcohol, Steareth-21, Sodium Chloride, Behenyl Alcohol, PPG-30, Steareth-2, Sodium Glycolate, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carnosine, Disodium EDTA, Ascorbic Acid, Fragrance, Iron Oxides.* \n\nI would like to use my moment on the soapbox to remind you ladies to double check ingredients on generics, because just because it says 'compare to' doesn't mean it's a perfect dupe. \n\nNow, I'm not 100% on apricot seed powder for facial use, but in a previous thread walnut seed powder was discussed and deemed bad for a face, just like the normal St. Ives Apricot Seed scrub. Now of course I can't find said thread grrr! Either way this cleanser contains Sodium Laurl Sulfate, which means I will not be continuing to use it, as I'd like to avoid that ingredient. \n\n(also, I'm surprise Olay cleanser use it, to be honest)\n\n**If you have a cleanser recommendation, I'll take it! I prefer creamy ones. I did not like CeraVe, I broke out really badly using their products! They just aren't for me :/ I really liked Ponds Cold Cream (even after the ingredient change), but I decided mineral oil and the OCM method is not for me, so anything with the words mineral oil in the ingredients is out. I work at a very dirty job and I also use a cleanser to remove makeup, verses using oil, so I'd prefer something that could still be able to remove it all, which the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating cleanser did not. If I must, I guess I'd use a cleanser with SLS, as I obviously was not super dry with this cleanser, but that might because I moisturize like nobodies business.**",

Currently there are several thousand ingredients that can make up a fragrance concoction, and they're considered trade secrets so those ingredients aren't required to be disclosed. However, a number of these ingredients, particularly phthalates, have been associated with hormonal imbalance (like early puberty, fetus deformation, obesity) as well as cancer. Other concerns involve contact skin allergies.  Some of these ingredients are also bioaccumulative, so small doses can still be unsafe if used over long periods of time.

She started to lick the lotion and I immediately realized my mistake and took her to the bathroom to shampoo and rinse her off, but she did keep trying to lick it every time i looked away to get the shampoo etc. I don’t think she could have possibly ingested very much, but I can’t find clear answers online about how worried I should be. I have been watching her the entire time since this happened and she seems completely fine but I am scared to sleep in case she starts to get sick. It’s my mom’s cat and I don’t drive or know exactly which vet she sees or anything but if it’s an emergency I can try to wake my mom up. I guess I just want to confirm the right thing to do is just keep an eye on her and see if she seems ok? I don’t think a vet could even do anything if she isn’t throwing up / acting lethargic or anything right?  I have really bad anxiety so it is entirely possible I am overreacting but I love this cat and would feel awful if I got her sick\n :(    Lotion ingredients are Water, Glycerin, Distearyldimonium Chloride, Petrolatum, Isopropyl Palmitate, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Colloidal Oatmeal, Allantoin, Benzyl Alcohol and Sodium Chloride. I know the alcohol could be worrisome if she ingested enough but I am not sure what I should do. Please help!!!",

No white cast at all. Yay for not being shinyyy and not breaking ouuut~ I'm thinking of either repurchasing, buying the body version because it has more product (what's the difference, right?

There are not many in the recommended products list, and adding semi-permanent dye to my conditioners, as the guide recommended worked very badly (I had color in it months later!). So I went on a search for approved conditioners and this is what I found!\n\n*My hair:* Definitely wavy and not curly, relatively fine, color-treated but weirdly protein sensitive despite that (????), naturally dry, high porosity, long. My coloration isn't dramatic - I basically go from a dark blonde to having honey-colored highlights. \n\n**Pura d'Or ColorHarmony Purple Conditioner** - This one is nicely pigmented - I can leave it on 3-5 minutes and be toned, though I usually leave it 7-10 - and moisturizing. My hair generally feels nice and soft afterwards. It has glycerin, though not high on the list; regardless it works best for me if I use it within the 30-60 dewpoint range. It has some protein, but not too much - my hair has never gotten strawlike after it as long as I moisturize adequately. I really recommend it. \n\n*Ingredients**:*  Decolorized Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice\\*, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract\\*, Glycerin\\*, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetearyl Alcohol (1-Hexadecanol, 1-Octadecanol), Colocasia (Taro) Esculenta\\*, Biotin, Avena Sativa (Oat) Bran Extract\\*, Citrus Aurantium (Orange) Peel Extract\\*, Ethylhexyl Olivate, Squalane, Bambusa (Bamboo) Vulgaris\\*, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil\\*, Keratin, Biotin, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Saponins, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Zinc Sulfate, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Oil\\*, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil\\*, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Oil\\*, Xylityl Sesquicaprylate, Citric Acid, Ext. Violet 2 (CI 60730). \n\n**dHue Cool Blonde Conditioner -** This one is less pigmented - reports are that it doesn't tone well for certain people - and has more protein; overall I enjoy it less and find it more drying, but I have it in my arsenal because it's glycerin free and I need it for \\~30 and 60+ dewpoints. I've kind of just worked out how to use it - every 2nd or 3rd wash, leaving it in for 10 minutes, followed by a moisturizing, protein-free conditioner (so I condition twice overall *on top of* a leave-in). With that in mind, it works perfectly fine; it tones decently and my hair still looks nice. \n\n*Ingredients:*  Water/Aqua/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Distearyldimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Silk Amino Acids, Hydrolyzed Silk, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance (Pa\u001drfum), Citric Acid, CI 60730, Acid Violet 43 (Ext. Violet 2). \n\n**Note on the Shampoos:** The shampoos associated with these conditioners have questionable ingredients for CGM and are pretty drying. I do find they're good clarifying shampoos every month or two, but wouldn't personally use them on a regular basis since my hair is already dry.\n\nHope this helps!",

Loreal EverClean Cleaning Cleanser or DevaCurl No-Poo Conditioning Cleanser as a in between clarifying shampoo as needed. MY condition would be the Trader Joes Nourish Spa Conditioner OR the Mane and Tail Conditioner. I have previously used mane and tail and I loved it when I used it which is why I am leaning that way. Also I noticed there are parabens in both.

It feels great on my skin, soothes it INSTANTLY, hydrates it and gets rid of that horrible tight / dry feeling and just makes it feel comfortable.\n\nMy problem is that i've recently been looking into the ingredients as I have seen some negative comments about it, and after finding out some of the ingredients in it - it makes me think... Why does my skin respond to it so well?\n\nSo the ingredients are:\n\nAqua, Glycerin, **Distearyldimonium Chloride**, Isopropyl Palmitate, Paraffinum Liquidum, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Avena Sativa Kernel Flour, Allantoin, Paraffin, Cera Microcristallina, **Isopropyl Alcohol**, Stearyl Alcohol, Myristyl Alcohol, Sodium Chloride, Benzyl Alcohol  \n\n\nThe two ingredients I have highlighted are known for irritating sensitive skin... \n\n**Distearyldimonium Chloride** is often used in hair conditioners as when it is rinsed out some of the product stays on the skin/hair leaving a silky coating, but it is known to be a potential irritant for sensitive skin, so why is it listed as the third ingredient in aveeno? \n\n**Isopropyl Alcohol** is what we know as 'rubbing alcohol' - and my question is what would even be the purpose of this in the cream? Its known as a major skin irritant I understand the reason it may not irritate is because its so low on the ingredient list but why would it even be needed in the cream?",

A couple days ago I got fed up of trying new treatments (antifungals, moisturisers etc) that I just dropped it all and said let me just try the “routine” I used to do before my seb derm appeared. \n\nThis consists of: \n- wash face with simple refreshing facial gel wash \n- moisturise with Aveeno moisturising cream \n\nMy face is significantly less itchy. Not red. Ofc around my nose the skin is still broken (I think this will need hydrocortisone to heal). My eyelids have stopped flaking and so has my chin. I am confused as Aveeno includes many ingredients that feed the fungus and additionally has a bad alcohol and paraffin. \n\nHere’s the full ingredient list: \n\nAqua, Glycerin, Distearyldimonium Chloride, Isopropyl Palmitate, Paraffinum Liquidum, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Avena Sativa Kernel (Oat) Flour, Paraffin, Cera Microcristallina, Sodium Chloride, BHT, Benzyl Alcohol.\n\nShould I continue with this routine? I am very confused tbh. The Aveeno doesn’t look like it’s the best for my face as it has paraffin in it, bad alcohol and fungus feeding ingredients plus its a body moisturiser not a face one. \n\nIf anyone can shed some light on why this is helping and if I should continue please let me know. \n\nThank you :)",

I had very bad acne, and I still always have a few pimples on my face. For the last few years, I've used their Rapid Action face scrub and treatment lotion. Here are all the face things I have currently, usually only using the face scrub (Rapid Action or 5 in 1) and lotion: http://imgur.com/a/gPZ6b\n\nI have heard that Clearasil is too harsh and I'm going to change what I use (Cerave cleanser and face lotion & red box Stridex are the plan), but ***my question is: Is this harming my skin to the point that I should just chuck these and start over? Or can I use the rest? I hate thinking of wasting it. \nAnd if I should just get rid of them, is the lotion at least acceptable to use up while I try the new cleanser?***\n___________________________________________________\n**Clearasil Rapid Action Face Scrub Ingredients**: Active Ingredient: Salicylic Acid (2%).

Find something with 2% with salicylic acid and no alcohol (stridex in the red box), a gentle cleanser (cerave, cetaphil are recommended here) and a basic moisturiser (again as above, or check the side bar!). What's your skin like, as well as having pimples, dry? Oily? Flaky? You can pick up benzoyl peroxide, tea tree oil and witch hazel to spot treat with. But again these can be drying to focus on moisturising and putting an occlusive like vaseline of aquaphor over dry areas. Edit: if you're using so many drying products and alcohol on your face this could make your skin break out even more and make it red and inflamed.",

They are based on individual ingredients rather than **any negative effects the final product may have.** The way ingredients interact in a formulation can influence their potential impact, and the presence of a specific ingredient does not automatically equate to harm when used in a product. It's always crucial to do your own research, consider the product as a whole, and keep in mind that personal reactions can vary greatly. When making decisions about personal care products, it is recommended to consult with healthcare professionals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brief**: This baby lotion contains Dimethicone, a type of silicone that creates a protective barrier on the skin, helping to keep it hydrated. However, it's also formulated with Benzyl Alcohol and Fragrance, which may cause irritation or allergic reactions in sensitive babies. The inclusion of Petrolatum, a petroleum derivative, might be of concern to some parents due to potential impurities. Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Flour is generally soothing, but could pose an issue for babies with gluten intolerance or sensitivity. Sodium Chloride (salt) in the formula could lead to dryness with overuse. As always, it's advisable to perform a patch test to rule out any potential adverse reactions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients:** Dimethicone, Water, glycerin, distearyldimonium chloride, petrolatum, isopropyl palmitate, cetyl alcohol, avena sativa (oat) kernel flour, benzyl alcohol, fragrance, sodium chloride.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Typical ingredients description and side effects\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Dimethicone\n   * Dimethicone is a type of silicone used in many skin and hair care products, including baby lotion, due to its smoothing properties and ability to form a barrier on the skin, which can help keep it hydrated.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Some people may experience skin irritation from products containing dimethicone, especially if they have sensitive skin. This can include symptoms like redness, itching, or a rash.\n      * Allergic Reactions: Allergic reactions to dimethicone are rare, but they can occur. Symptoms of an allergic reaction can include hives, swelling, itching, or difficulty breathing.\n      * Acne and Skin Congestion: While dimethicone is non-comedogenic (meaning it shouldn't clog pores), some people find that it can contribute to skin congestion or acne, possibly due to the barrier it forms on the skin, which may trap dirt or oil. This is more likely to be a concern for individuals with acne-prone skin and less of a concern for infants.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  Distearyldimonium Chloride \n   * Distearyldimonium Chloride is a quaternary ammonium salt that's often used in personal care products such as lotions, creams, and hair conditioners because of its anti-static and conditioning properties. It helps to soften and soothe the skin and to reduce or prevent static electricity, improving the feel and manageability of hair. Like any ingredient, Distearyldimonium Chloride can potentially cause side effects in some individuals, but it's generally considered safe as used in cosmetics and personal care products.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: This is the most common potential side effect. While Distearyldimonium Chloride is generally considered safe and non-irritating for most people, individuals with sensitive skin or allergies may experience irritation. Signs of irritation can include redness, itching, burning, or discomfort at the site of application.\n      * Eye Irritation: If a product containing Distearyldimonium Chloride comes into contact with the eyes, it could potentially cause irritation.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Petrolatum\n   * Petrolatum, commonly known as petroleum jelly, is often used in baby care products including lotions due to its excellent moisturizing properties. It forms a barrier on the skin, preventing moisture loss and protecting the skin from external irritants. This makes it particularly beneficial for treating dry or chapped skin.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Some babies might experience minor skin irritation from products containing petrolatum. This could present as redness, rash, or a slight stinging sensation.\n      * Potential for Breakouts: Petrolatum forms a barrier on the skin that could potentially trap dirt and oils. While breakouts are less common in babies than in teenagers and adults, this could potentially lead to minor skin issues.\n      * Potential Contaminants: There has been some concern about impurities present in petrolatum, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have been linked to health issues. However, the petrolatum used in cosmetics and personal care products is highly refined and must meet strict safety standards.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Benzyl Alcohol\n   * Benzyl Alcohol is a type of alcohol used as a solvent and preservative in many types of cosmetics and personal care products, including baby lotion. In small amounts, it is generally safe for use in these types of products. However, like any ingredient, it can potentially cause side effects in some individuals.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: In some individuals, particularly those with sensitive skin or allergies, Benzyl Alcohol may cause skin irritation. Symptoms can include redness, itching, burning, or discomfort at the site of application.\n      * Allergic Reactions: While uncommon, some people might have an allergic reaction to Benzyl Alcohol. Symptoms of an allergic reaction can include severe skin redness, hives, swelling, and in severe cases, difficulty breathing.\n      * Eye Irritation: If a product containing Benzyl Alcohol comes into contact with the eyes, it can potentially cause eye irritation.\n      * Toxicity in High Concentrations: High concentrations of Benzyl Alcohol can be toxic, especially in premature newborns. However, the concentrations used in cosmetics and personal care products are generally low and considered safe.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Fragrance\n   * Fragrance in baby lotion can provide a pleasant smell and enhance the experience of using the product. However, \"fragrance\" is a broad term that can refer to any one of thousands of ingredients used to scent personal care products. Because the specific ingredients used in a fragrance are often not listed, it can be difficult to know exactly what's in a product and how it might affect your baby.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation or Allergic Reactions: The most common issue with fragrances is that they can irritate the skin or cause an allergic reaction. This is particularly a concern for individuals with sensitive skin or known allergies. Symptoms can include redness, itching, swelling, or a rash.\n      * Respiratory Distress: Some people may experience respiratory issues such as difficulty breathing, wheezing, or coughing when exposed to certain fragrances, particularly if they have asthma or other respiratory conditions.\n      * Headaches or Dizziness: Some people may be sensitive to strong smells and can experience headaches or dizziness due to fragrances.\n      * Contact Dermatitis: This is a red, itchy rash caused by direct contact with a substance or an allergic reaction to it.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 8\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe grading system used by EWG in the Skin Deep database is as follows:\n\n1 to 2: Low hazard\n\n3 to 6: Moderate hazard\n\n7 to 10: High hazard",

Maybe colloidal oatmeal? \n\nThanks. So stumped why it burns me.",
