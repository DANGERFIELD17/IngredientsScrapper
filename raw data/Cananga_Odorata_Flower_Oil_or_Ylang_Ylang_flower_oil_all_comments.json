I read your earlier post on Top 10-20 Cleansing Oils & Gels also. \n\nI'm looking to introduce a new cleanser to my daily routine and was playing with the idea of an oil cleanser.  So much choice, but this should make it easier.  Ideally, I'm looking for something without propylene glycol. butylene glycol, essential oils or added fragrance.  And no parabens - was shocked to see Phytomer still incorporating these!  The ATrue Black Tea Cleanser in your previous post looked interesting; simple list of ingredients, although ironically green tea is the first ingredient in the list, rather than black tea!  Aromatica Orange Cleansing Sherbet looks interesting, as does Clinique - so simple but effective.  Have you any idea what Kakadu (reference Sidmool) means??\n\nWhich do you use incidentally?  You are probably more geared up than most to recommend?  Thanks again.  Bev",

I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!\n\nIngredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1.** \\[**BEPLAIN\\] Cicaful Ampoule - 4.34/5 (3,174 Reviews)**\n\n30ml/29,000 KRW\n\nCentella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyglycerin-3, Pentylene Glycol, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Sodium Hyalutonate, Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacilius/Rice Ferment, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Xantham Gum, 1,2 Hexanediol, Ethyhexylglycerin.\n\n*The few reviews I have read for this say that it absorbs fast, is pretty soothing, and some people state that it really helped their acne. The expectation seems to be that it's supposedly very good for acne prone skin. There are pictures of someone with pretty bad acne showing before and after pictures of their acne going away. (Korean skin care is more geared toward CALMING & SOOTHING acne than to go to war with it with drying treatments and whatnot. I guess because a large component of acne is inflammation?)* \n\n*Some people said it doesn't seem to do anything for them, sensitive types seems to like it a lot, that it absorbs quickly. They like that it's unfragranced. Some VERY oily types said they feel like their skin is a little bit more oilier when they use it and that it doesn't absorb well for them. It may be really popular due to Director Pi suggesting it as the #1 soothing ampoule in her recent video. I see Director Pi's name pop up quite a lot in reviews in general.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cvm5b0doc8731.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=75f5866f4847487e1271f277ff8db20353b394b0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. \\[BADSKIN\\] Collagen BOMB Hydrating Ampoule - 4.28/5 (5,002 Reviews)**\n\n400ml/24,000 KRW (400ml ampoule??!)\n\nHydrolyzed Collagen, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Water, 1,2 Hexanediol, Trehalose, Carylyl Glycol, Allantoin, Propanediol, Brassica Olearacea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Medicago Sativa (Alfalfa) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Capitata (Cabbage) Leaf Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Brassica Campestris (Rapeseed) Extract, Raphanus Sativus (Radish) Seed Extract, Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hyaluronic Acid.\n\n*Reviews for this basically say that this is ULTRA moisturizing. A little bit on the heavier side so oily skin may not like it, but all the dry skinned people seemed to really, really love this. It's cheap, very hydrating, absorbs well. However, a few oily people said it takes a little bit to sink in for them.*\n\n[BIG](https://preview.redd.it/d2pcet1rc8731.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e4fac533d2f3f52e206e338e85a10c33fc69df5)\n\nB I G\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. \\[Manyo Factory (Witch Factory)\\] Bifida Complex Ampoule - 4.21/5 (5,368 Reviews)**\n\n50ml/35,000 KRW\n\nBifida Ferment Lysate, Lactobacillus/Pumpkin Fruit Ferment Filtrate, Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, Copper Tripeptide-1, Aureobasidium Pullulans Ferment, Panax Ginseng Callus Culture Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Glycerin, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Caffeine, Hydrolyzed Algin, Red Ginseng Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Methyl Gluceth-20, Epigallocatechin Gallate.\n\n*This is a very popular product. This and their Galactomyces Niacin Ampoule have been consistently on #1/somewhere in the top 20 list since their debut in 2012 according to Director Pi. This ampoule has been #1 for like forever from what I'm gleaming. However, their expiry is 2 years unopened, and 6 months opened. Supposedly studies done by Estee Lauder say that bifida ferment has been shown to strengthen your skin barrier over time and make it less sensitive to things.

    "body": "Cleansing balms\n\nUPDATE 8/20/20: I‚Äôm adding a new balm I‚Äôve recently tried (at the bottom of the list). If anyone has tried balms that you‚Äôd like to review in the format used, please post them below!!!\n\nOk, I‚Äôve been (still am) on a mission to try and review all of the best/most popular cleansing balms in an effort to find the very very best one. I‚Äôve tried nearly all of the most popular ones now. I searched everywhere for a comprehensive review of all of these and couldn‚Äôt find much so I‚Äôm hoping this will be a helpful resource to others who might be looking too. I welcome any input!!\n\nBackstory:\nI had been using The Body Shop‚Äôs Camomile balm since way before cleansing balms went mainstream, for probably a decade at least. I never knew there were other options until I was given a sample of Farmacy Green Clean and that‚Äôs what started me down this path - I wanted to see what the best option truly is! I liked my Camomile but could there be a better balm out there waiting for me??!\n\nAs always, YMMV but below are my results! All prices are in Canadian dollars and I have not researched pricing or availability in other countries.\n\nAs for what I actually use it for - I don‚Äôt wear a full face of makeup every single day but I do always wear a tinted sunscreen and mascara at a minimum, usually with a light powder foundation, blush and brow gel as well. I‚Äôve tried every balm below on little to no makeup up to a full face of special occasion makeup.\n\nA note about ingredients - I‚Äôve copied ingredient lists below from the brands websites. It was important to me to evaluate which ones have polyethylene (plastic) as well as essential oils.\n\nI would LOVE to hear your thoughts on those below or any other options I haven‚Äôt tried yet!\n\n**TL;DR FINAL VERDICT**: for a really good clean and soft face, Drunk Elephant‚Äôs Slaii is probably the best value in terms of value, packaging, ingredients, etc. I think this will continue to be my go to in the super dry winter months (especially since I tend to wear a bit thicker makeup in the winter), but to be honest, I think I will probably continue use my trusty Body Shop Camomile Cleansing Butter in the summers.\n\n**The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter**\n\nSize: 90mL (3oz).   \nPrice: $17 CAD @ The Body Shop reg price (but it‚Äôs often on sale).   \nPrice per oz: $5.67/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a wide and flat metal tin that is perfect for storing bobby pins or things in after (no plastic packaging, yay!). I have had a few times over the years where the threads get misaligned and stuck if it was tightened wrong and have needed to use a knife or screwdriver to pry it open again.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.   \nTexture & Emulsion: When scooping the balm out, it stays a little solid as you rub it into your skin. I wouldn‚Äôt say it emulsifies 100% to an oil but it feels great on the face and it‚Äôs super spreadable once warmed up. Doesn‚Äôt feel greasy/oily, more creamy.    \nScent: Very neutral scent, I don‚Äôt believe there are any added scents, essential oils or fragrances.    \nOn the Eyes: It doesn‚Äôt sting the eyes at all, but sometimes there‚Äôs a light film, if so I just blink a few times and it goes away.    \nAmount Required: A very small amount is required for my whole face (probably about 1/2 tsp max) and one tin easily lasts me a few months.    \nIngredients: No plastic to be found here! I also love that the ingredient list is short and sweet.    \nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Citric Acid.    \n\nVERDICT: I‚Äôve loved this forever and to be honest, now that I‚Äôve tried some others I‚Äôm not totally sure if the grass is actually greener on the other side. Still a top contender for me and the price is amazing! I do wonder though if my skin feels a just a tiny bit less moisturized after using this (compared to some of the others below)...\n\n**Farmacy Green Clean** \n\nSize: 90mL (3oz).   \nPrice: $45 CAD @ Sephora Canada.   \nPrice per oz: $15/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes, but the plastic tray it is stored in is very flimsy (sits in top of the tub).    \nTexture & Emulsion: When scooping the balm out, it melts easily and emulsifies quickly to rub around your face. Not greasy/oily.    \nScent: Light citrusy scent (almost like a lime sherbert or something) that smells so good I just want it all over my face all the time.    \nOn the Eyes: I do find it causes quite a bit of a film if I use it on the eyes (something I‚Äôd never really experienced before with the Camomile balm), no stinging unless it gets directly in the eyes. Makeup dissolves easily with minimal rubbing or tugging.    \nAmount Required: A small amount is required.    \nIngredients: While they say it‚Äôs not ‚Äúmicrobeads‚Äù and that it melts in water, this product does contain polyethylene aka plastic. Take that for what you will. This product does have quite a bit of essential oils and extracts.    \n\nCetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Peg-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Peg-10 Isostearate, Polyethylene, Phenoxyethanol, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Amino Esters-1, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Amber Powder, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Water/ Aqua/ Eau, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Echinacea Purpurea Root Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Moringa Pterygosperma Seed Extract, Disodium Phosphate, Citric Acid.   \n\n\nVERDICT: I like it, I love it, I want some more of it. It smells amazing and feels luxurious on the face. Even though a little goes a long way, I do have a hard time justifying spending that much money on a first cleanser (and I don‚Äôt love that it contains polyethylene and a lot of essential oils).\n\n**Physicians Formula The Perfect Matcha 3-in-1 Melting Cleansing Balm**\n\nSize: 41mL (1.4oz).  \nPrice: $15 CAD @ Shoppers Drug Mart (also find at Walmart, Superstore etc).   \nPrice per oz: $10.71/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a screw top and an internal insert underneath. The insert holds the very tiny spatula.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes but it‚Äôs tiny, about the size of a safety pin.   \nTexture & Emulsion: It melts but it‚Äôs not overly emollient and isn‚Äôt as spreadable as others I‚Äôve tried.    \nScent: Sort of a light essential oily/green tea/citrus scent. Some say it smells like Green Clean but I completely disagree and it‚Äôs nowhere near as nice of a smell.    \nOn the Eyes: A bit of eye stinging and a definite film was to be had.    \nAmount Required: Larger amount required to effectively remove makeup/sunscreen of any I‚Äôve tried to date.    \nIngredients: Looks like we have that ever present plastic again (polyethylene) as well as fragrance, food colouring and citrus essential oils. Sad face.    \nCETYL ETHYLHEXANOATE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SORBETH-30 TETRAOLEATE, PEG-5 GLYCERYL TRIISOSTEARATE, PEG-10 ISOSTEARATE, POLYETHYLENE, FRAGRANCE/PARFUM, CAMELLIA SINENSIS LEAF POWDER*, PHYLLOSTACHYS EDULIS SHOOT WATER**, NELUMBO NUCIFERA FLOWER EXTRACT***, CITRUS NOBILIS (MANDARIN ORANGE) PEEL OIL, WATER/EAU, PHENOXYETHANOL, SORBITAN SESQUIOLEATE, POLYGLYCERYL-10 OLEATE, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, LACTIC ACID, SODIUM BENZOATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, MALTODEXTRIN, YELLOW 5 (CI 19140), BLUE 1 (CI 42090). *MATCHA, **BAMBOO, ***LOTUS\n\nVERDICT: It‚Äôs a no from me, dawg. I couldn‚Äôt wait to finish this (relatively small) tub so I could try the next product. Having heard so many claims that it‚Äôs a perfect dupe for Green Clean, I was VERY disappointed. IMO they are nothing alike other than the colour (both balms are a light green colour). Smell, texture, effectiveness, price, ingredients - nothing wowed me.\n\n**Heimish All Clean Balm**\n\nSize: 120mL (4oz).   \nPrice: $23.95 CAD @ Amazon.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $5.99/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a flip top. Under the lid is a second lid which holds the included spatula. I like that the spatula is separated from the product but the extra lid makes it extra bulky in my cabinet.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes.   \nTexture & Emulsion: This balm I‚Äôd say emulsified almost immediately to a complete oil. It has a light oil feel (similar to say a sunflower oil, not as thick as an olive oil for example). It melts right away once it touches your face and feels like an oil face massage as you rub it in. It feels quite luxurious!    \nScent: Light floral scent (smells like essential oils). I like it and it‚Äôs not too overpowering IMO but I have heard some people find it too strong of a scent.    \nOn the Eyes: No stinging and the eye film is minimal.    \nAmount Required: I‚Äôd say a medium amount. Definitely more than the Camomile and Green Clean but it doesn‚Äôt seem excessive.    \nIngredients: There is polyethylene (plastic) in this as well as a number of essential oils which those with sensitive skin may wish to avoid.    \nEthylhexyl palmitate, cetyl ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, polyethylene, PEG-8 isostearate, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, cocos nucifera (coconut) fruit extract, citrus aurantifolia (lime) fruit extract, freesia refracta extract, iris versicolor extract, jasminum officinale (jasmine) extract, lilium tigrinum extract, leontopodium alpinum extract, nelumbium speciosum flower extract, narcissus pseudo-narcissus (daffodil) flower extract, rose extract, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) peel oil, lavandula angustifolia (lavender) oil, pelargonium graveolens flower oil, amyris balsamifera bark oil, citrus paradisi (grapefruit) peel oil, eucalyptus globulus leaf oil, melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) leaf oil, juniperus mexicana oil, boswellia carterii oil, citrus aurantium bergamia (bergamot) fruit oil, tocopheryl acetate, 1,2-hexanediol.\n\nVERDICT: There‚Äôs a lot to love about this - the scent and the texture are awesome, the price is definitely right, and I enjoy using it. My skin does always feel great after and it doesn‚Äôt dry me out. Cons for me are the bulky packaging, the amount of essential oils and the microbeads. I do like it but I‚Äôm not ready to stop my search quite yet.\n\n**Drunk Elephant Slaai**\n\nSize: 115mL (3.83oz).   \nPrice: $45 @ Sephora Canada.   \n(Note that this price includes a small vial of Bamboo Booster (physical exfoliating grains) as well).   \nPrice per oz: $11.75/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top. The spatula is magnetic and sits on top of the tub via a magnet (super handy for the makeup cupboard but also exposed/can pop off in a makeup bag while travelling).    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes.    \nTexture & Emulsion: Feels like softened butter and emulsifies to a thick oil feeling (similar to olive oil).     \nScent: Neutral, but a light olive oil type scent. I wish it had a nicer smell but it‚Äôs not offensive.     \nOn the Eyes: No stinging, easily removed eye makeup.    \nAmount Required: just a little, I‚Äôd say the smallest amount of any I‚Äôve tried which is great news for it lasting a good while.\n\nIngredients: There don‚Äôt appear to be any polyethylene in this product and it‚Äôs lighter on the essential oils as well (good news if you have sensitive skin).\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Lauryl Laurate, Polyglyceryl-3 Laurate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Wax, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Oil, Actinidia Chinensis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Ananassa (Strawberry) Seed Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Polyglyceryl-2 Caprate, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Seed Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Schinziophyton Rautanenii Kernel Oil, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Ximenia Americana Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Glycerin\n\nVERDICT: Love love love! Definitely don‚Äôt use too much but when using a small amount the oiliness isn‚Äôt too much and it makes my face feel soft and clean. However, a second cleanse is a must.\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Balm**\n\nSize: 125mL (4.17oz).    \nPrice: $40 @ Sephora Canada.    \nPrice per oz: $9.59/oz.    \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.    \nTexture & Emulsion: Texture is comparable to a solid form coconut oil (similar to the Heimish balm in texture and colour also). Emulsified quickly to a soft oil.    \nScent: Unscented.    \nOn the Eyes: A light film, but no stinging. Takes extra rubbing to loosen stubborn eye makeup.    \nAmount Required: Medium amount (not as much as Heimish but not as little as Drunk Elephant).    \n\nIngredients: Very short ingredients list but unfortunately, those classic plastics are in this balm as well (polyethylene).\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate , Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil , Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride , Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate , Polyethylene , Peg-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate , Water\\Aqua\\Eau , Tocopherol , Phenoxyethanol\n\nVERDICT: Honestly, I have no real bad things to say. It‚Äôs utilitarian. It doesn‚Äôt feel luxurious but it works.\n\n\n**Acure Seriously Soothing 3 in 1 Serum**\n\nSize: 50mL (1.7 oz).   \nPrice: $23.49 @ well.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $13.82/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a glass jar with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.   \nTexture & Emulsion: A very soft solid serum that gets a little melty when room temperature is quite warm. It melts immediately in your hand/on your face and becomes a liquidy oil. It feels luxurious but does leave an oily film so a second cleanse is definitely required.\nScent: Strong scent due to the blue tansy oil (some might not like it but I do!)\nOn the Eyes: It‚Äôs very gentle and doesn‚Äôt sting or leave a film.\nAmount Required: Very little required. I‚Äôd say about half a teaspoon for my whole face including eye makeup.\nIngredients: No plastic here! Just very basic natural ingredients.\n\nCaprylic/capric Triglyceride, Euphorbia Cerifera(Candelilla) Wax, Copernicia Cerifera(Carnauba) Wax, Butyrospermum Parkii(Shea) Butter, Rosa Canina(Rosehip) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa(Argan) Oil, Tocopherol(Vitamin E), Tanacetum Annum (Blue Tansy)flower Oil, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant)seed Oil.\n\nVERDICT: I didn‚Äôt originally buy this for a cleanser, (just as a balm) but used it in a pinch as my first cleanse when I accidentally lost my jar of Slaai on a camping trip. I love how my skin feels soft and soothed after using it as a cleanser and it feels so silky on my skin. It is a little on the expensive side but I think it‚Äôs a keeper for sure seeing as it‚Äôs so versatile!!\n\n**Banila Co. Clean It Zero Original Balm Cleanser**\n\nSize: 100mL (3.3 oz).   \nPrice: $27.96 @ Amazon.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $8.40/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: TBD.   \nTexture &amp;amp; Emulsion: TBD.   \nScent: TBD.   \nOn the Eyes: TBD.    \nAmount Required: TBD.   \nIngredients: Doesn‚Äôt look like there‚Äôs any microbeads in this bad boy, thankfully!\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, PEG-10 Isostearate, Synthetic Wax, Onsen-Sui, Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Lithospermum Erythrorhizon Root Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Ethylhexylglycerin, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Bambusa Vulgaris Leaf/Stem Extract Aspalathus Linearis Extract, Angelica Archangelica Root Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Polydiethyleneglycol Adipate/IPDI Copolymer, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Acrylates/Methoxy PEG-15 Methacrylate Copolymer\n\nVERDICT: TBD - haven‚Äôt tried it yet but I plan to so I‚Äôve included the info I was able to find so far.\n\n\nYour turn!

Just because it takes the # of reviews into account. You can find lots of good reviews vouching for very good products with lesser amount of reviews. It doesn't necessarily mean that just because a product is extremely popular, there can't be lesser known amazing products as well. For some categories, like toners and creams, I feel that it's worth to look all the way down towards the 40s and 50s. I think I will make certain categories longer if you guys don't mind my spamming, lol.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm thinking doing creams or gels next. =) Thank you everybody for the comments, glad to see the time I spent making these posts is helping some of you!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Oils & Gels](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6dqq7/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing_oils_gels/)\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Balms/Milks/Creams & Foams](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6fso3/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing/)",

    "body": "I did bury the company name somewhat, but if you made it here, you'll find it. Everything I say here is my opinion based solely on their website content, and I've never tried their products or even heard of them before today. Part of the reason that I am so specifically critical of this brand is that they also sell an expensive oral supplement for hair, which I think is inappropriate for any cosmetics brand to do, but it is especially worrisome from a tiny one that is so loose with their claims for other products.\n\nOn the other hand, seldom does a company make it this easy to read their labels with some kind of confidence, so I thought it might be interesting to share. On the website product pages they do a couple of bullet-point type \"contains X% of Y\" that I call advertising claims for ingredients, but when compared to the full ingredients list it becomes obvious just how far they're stretching. In one case it is obvious that the claim percent is probably how much of the material as supplied they use, the rest are less clear.\n\nI want to say that despite the cleanwashing and the painfully bad sciencewashing this brand does, these may not be bad products to use, though they all range between somewhat and ridiculously overpriced. However, they are pushing the limits of language use in advertising/marketing to the flimsiest edge of reason and legality, and their \"science\" is a mish-mash of misleading puffery, long debunked fearmongering misinformation, and some other stuff I think they pulled out of thin air. Given all of the aroma chemicals in some their ingredients lists, I'd love to know how they would define \"synthetic\" in relationship to fragrance.\n\nThey have filed a patent application both World and US for stirring ingredients together at room temperature to make their products, which has got to be some troll level BS, or maybe a shady sidestep attempt to patent protect the cosmetic products ingredients lists or formulas without actually doing anything patentable. They are not Skinceuticals making a breakthrough with C E Ferulic. I mostly skimmed these because reading such patent apps is a good treatment for insomnia.\n\nWorld patent app here: https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2019165115A1/en\n\nUS here: https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200375877A1/en\n\nThe US version removes claims 8-17 as compared to the World version.\n\nNo idea where the hyperbaric chamber nonsense fits into this, but I laughed very hard at what seems to be a cut & paste definition of a pressure chamber from somewhere else. The patent app doesn't mention needing a hyperbaric chamber, despite the website claims.\n\nLast thing that I can't let go of: A quick lab test is not a clinical trial. In this case it \"proves\" that the 3 main products used in sequence will clean some synthetic sebum out of standardized hair samples in a lab.\n\nOh, and they've registered a trademark for Cold Processed. Yeah. https://uspto.report/company/Act-Acre-Inc\n\nAnyway. Enough of my judgemental rambling. On to the real reason for this: the labels!\n\nThey start as expected, but everything under 1% is listed alphabetically for most of their products. There are a few I didn't include here. I've formatted them to italics at the point where they go alphabetical to make it more obvious.\n\n**Act+Acre Stem Cell Serum** (for the scalp)\n\nAdvertising claim amounts: 2% apple stem cells, 2% bamboo and pea extract\n\nIngredients list as of April 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, *Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (ALOE), Bambusa Vulgaris Leaf/Stem Extract (BAMBOO), Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Citric Acid, Plant-Based Collagen, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glucosamine Hcl, Glycereth-26, Lecithin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate (RADISH), Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract (APPLE), Pentylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Extract (PEA), Propanediol, Quercus Petraea Fruit Extract (OAK), Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Xanthan Gum*\n\nNote: Raw material manufacturers have been trying to make plant stem cells happen in cosmetics for well over a decade. I have not tried any and have no plans to do so. PhytoCellTec's SDS for their apple stem cell extract on Lotioncrafter's site gives the amount as 9% of the whole solution as supplied.\n\n**Hair Cleanse**\n\nAd Claim: 2% Apple amino acids, 0.045% Baobab oil (they say it supports a healthy scalp microbiome, not sure how that applies in a rinse off)\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids, Triethyl Citrate, Sorbitan Oleate Decylglucoside Crosspolymer, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, *Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil (BAOBAB), Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Oil (AMARANTH), Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil (AMYRIS), Aquilaria Agallocha Wood Oil (AGARWOOD), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Caprylyl Glycol, Cistus Ladaniferus Leaf/Stem Extract (ROCKROSE), Citric Acid, Cocamide Mipa, Dimethyl Heptenal, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil (CARDAMOM), Gamma-Nonalactone, Glycol Distearate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (SUNFLOWER), Hexenyl Acetate, Hexylene Glycol, Ionone, Juniperus Virginiana Oil (CEDARWOOD), Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil (LAVENDER), Menthyl Ethylamido Oxalate, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil (MORINGA), Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Pogostemon Cablin Oil (PATCHOULI), Potassium Sorbate, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract (ROSEMARY), Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Steareth-4, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Vanillin, Viola Odorata Flower/Leaf Extract (VIOLET), Xanthan Gum* \n\nNote: Oils are only put in shampoos for making label claims.\n\n**Scalp Detox**\n\nUndoubedly misleading as heck ad claims: 4.55% Aloe & Calendula Extract, 2.73% Botanical Blend (either of those could mean anything)\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (SUNFLOWER), Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil (SOYBEAN), Isostearyl Linoleate, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil (BAOBAB), Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil (MORINGA), *Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract (ALOE), Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Oil (AMARANTH), Calendula Officinalis Extract (CALENDULA), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil (ORANGE), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil (COCONUT), Ocimum Basilicum Hairy Root Culture Extract (BASIL), Vetiveria Zizanoides Root Oil (VETIVER)*\n\nNote: Calendula is frequently extracted in sunflower seed oil for commercial use, and oil soluble aloe extracts are also widely available. The process for how they claim to stir this formula together is in the patent application as Working Example 3. A version of the hair cleanse is example 1. Anyway, I would guess that it is probably 80% or more C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate.\n\n**Conditioning Hair Mask** (also called Restorative Hair Mask)\n\nAd claims: 2% castor oil, no other % claims but mentions shea butter and panthenol benefits\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Isoamyl Laurate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Glycerin, Diheptyl Succinate, Triethyl Citrate, Arachidyl Alcohol, Di-C12-15 Alkyl Fumarate, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, *Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil (AMYRIS), Aquilaria Agallocha Wood Oil (AGARWOOD), Arachidyl Glucoside, Behentrimonium Chloride, Behenyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Nut Extract (SHEA BUTTER), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Ceteareth-20, Cetrimonium Chloride, Cistus Ladaniferus Leaf/Stem Extract (ROCKROSE), Citric Acid, Dimethyl Heptenal, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil (CARDAMOM), Ethylhexylglycerin, Gamma-Nonalactone, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract (SUNFLOWER), Hexenyl Acetate, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Ionone, Juniperus Virginiana Oil (CEDARWOOD), Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Pogostemon Cablin Oil (PATCHOULI), Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil (CASTOR), Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract (ROSEMARY), Sclerotium Gum, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Vanillin, Viola Odorata Flower/Leaf Extract (VIOLET)*\n\nNote: The star here is Crodabond CSA INCI: Hydrogenated Castor Oil/Sebacic Acid Copolymer. It does have a tiny amount of plain castor oil too. Hard to say how accurate that 2% claim is.\n\nTheir **Hair Oil** doesn't have the detailed ingredients list that would show off their obvious fragrance inrgedients, as it would crush the \"just 5 natural ingredients\" idea, but they also say their squalane is squalene in the ad copy and I am petty enough about that kind of thing to put this here. \n\nAd claim from website: 5% plant-based squalene, 5% Argan oil\n\nList: Limnanthes alba (meadowfoam) seed oil, Squalane, Argania spinosa kernel (argan) oil, Crambe abyssinica seed oil phytosterol esters, Fragrance\n\nNote: As far as brand cohesiveness, this is an odd choice given the detailed ingredients lists of the other products that include the names of aroma chemicals and carefully avoid using the word \"fragrance\" but it is probably the most honest.",

    "body": "Recently Sokoglam released a collaboration product with Neogen: [Real Fresh Green Tea Cleansing Stick] (https://sokoglam.com/products/neogen-real-fresh-cleansing-stick-green-tea). I was super excited to see this as cleansing sticks are my new jam after the sum37 Miracle Rose Cleansing Stick became my HG, however, what I didn't know what that Neogen already had a green tea cleansing stick on the market! And one in almost identical packaging. \n\nSay what? \n\nSokoglam's founder, Charlotte Cho gave a tip through the Klog,\n>you can tell that it‚Äôs the latest version of the cleansing stick if you see my signature on the side of the packaging and has pink-colored leaves!\n\n*However, I only see that the difference in the external packaging, not on the actual product itself.* Paper is cheap, so of course, I then had to look into the ingredients to see if there actually was a difference.\n\nDue to the identical name of the products, it was a little annoying looking at the SEO results. However, I was able to find a review on the blog Beauty Versus Zombies that had a breakdown of ingredients as well.\n\nBeauty Versus Zombies published the [post on Aug 26 2016] (http://beautyversuszombies.com/everything-stick-cleansing-stick/), without a mention of the Neogen green tea stick cleanser as a collaborative product. Sokoglam introduced their version Dec 12 2016 on [the Klog] (http://theklog.co/green-tea-cleansing-stick-next-level/) and their official [Instagram] (https://www.instagram.com/p/BN8EaNVlzGk/?taken-by=sokoglam&hl=en), so I was able to safety differentiate that Beauty Versus Zombies had the original Neogen version.\n\nHere's the ingredient list for the original Neogen version (credits to Beauty Versus Zombies)\n>Glycerin, purified water, cocos nucifera (coconut) oil, palmitic acid, stearic acid, lauryl betaine, betaine, camellia sinensis leaf (3%), camellia japonica seed oil, olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, oenothera biennis (evening primrose) oil, tocopheryl acetate, citrus aurantifolia (lime) oil, ocimum basillicum (basil) oil, cananga odorata flower oil, citrus limon (lemon) peel oil, origanum heracleoticum flower oil, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) peel oil, fragrance\n\nnow here's the ingredient list for the Sokoglam x Neogen version that I pulled from Sokoglam's website:\n>Glycerin, purified water, cocos nucifera (coconut) oil, palmitic acid, stearic acid, lauryl betaine, betaine, camellia sinensis leaf(0.3%), **camellia sinensis seed oil(0.1%)**, camellia japonica seed oil, olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, helianthus annuus (sunflower)seed oil, **limnanthes alba (meadowfoam) seed oil**, oenothera biennis (eveningprimrose) oil, tocopheryl acetate, citrus aurantifolia (lime) oil, ocimum basillicum (basil) oil, cananga odorata flower oil, citrus limon (lemon) peel oil, origanum heracleoticum floweroil, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange)peel oil, fragrance\n\nAside from two bolded ingredients, everything else was the same. The Sokoglam version had added camellia sinensis seed oil (0.1%) and limnanthes alba (meadowfoam) seed oil. Of course, it should be noted that even with the same ingredients, maybe the concentration of ingredients was changed in the Sokoglam formula, but who can really tell just by looking at the ingredient list?\n\n\nI'm also not familiar with these two ingredients. Hence, the title of this post includes the term \"curious\" --- I'm curious if people have tried the Neogen original one and/or the Sokoglam version. I would love to hear your opinions on them, specifically if you think there's a major difference. Additionally, there doesn't seem to be that much of a retail price difference $20-$22 between the products as well.\n\n\nI was planning on buying the Sokoglam version to test it myself, but sadly it seems to be sold out right now. So I would love to hear your feedback!\n\n**EDIT 12/21/16** It has been kindly pointed out to me that the two are actually the same product! Charlotte Cho actually collaborated with Neogen for the Korean launch (without her name on it), but for the US launch Sokoglam was included in the credits. Ingredient list is also the same due to an error in translation.\n\n**EDIT 12/23/16 reply from Sokoglam** \n>Charlotte created both Neogen Cleansing Sticks, but there is a more updated version now after making iterations to the first version. The most recent version has her name on the packaging. *If you compare the list of ingredients, they are the same only because she changed the percentages (levels) of the ingredients slightly so there wasn‚Äôt movement on the ingredient list. She also changed the fragrance from the original, which is the biggest difference from the first version to the second.*\n\nThen I followed up with a question on the fragrance and received this answer:\n>The Neogen Cleansing Stick has always been Green Tea with its natural green tea leave extracts, however the fragrance itself did not reflect this in the first version, something a lot of people noted about the original version.\n\n**CONCLUSION 12/27/16** The two products are slightly different after all!",

I really feel like no other product has popped up on my social media feeds more than this item (aside from this summer‚Äôs cleansing balm obsession from Glow Recipe).¬†\n\nI ended up taking this product a lot more seriously once I began seeing it pop up in some of my favorite Korean YouTube Channels. So, Green Clean ended up finding its way into my routine over the past month and I‚Äôm so happy it did!\n\nFeaturing papaya, moringa, eggplant, and turmeric extracts...this super lightweight and creamy balm just melts into skin and provides the perfect amount of slide/glice to remove makeup and impurities.\n\nSunflower oil makes its way into¬† the formulation to add some nourishment and softness to the skin after rinsing. And that rinse, it‚Äôs awesome. The Farmacy Green Clean emulsifies and rinses better than any other cleansing balm I have used this year...all without making my skin dry/tight.¬†\n\nThe addition of several citrus based essential oils creates a key lime pie/lemon-lime soda scent that I love. And although I haven‚Äôt had any negative reaction to them...I certainly proceeded with caution as my skin hasn‚Äôt been appreciating these types of fragrant oils recently.¬†\n\nThis really is an awesome cleansing balm and I see why so many people proclaim their love of it. I‚Äôm right there with them and this product has easily become a top pick for this year.¬†\n\nPersonally, I‚Äôm looking forward to trying the limited edition Very Cherry Clean as it omits the essential oils and has an equally lovely cherry/vanilla scent.¬†\n\nHave you gotten to try the Farmacy Green Clean...what are your thoughts?\n\nFull Ingredients List: Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Peg-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Peg-10 Isostearate, Polyethylene, Echinacea Purpurea Root Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Moringa Pterygosperma Seed Extract, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Glycerin, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Amber Powder, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Water, Butylene Glycol, Disodium Phosphate, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Citral, Limonene, Linalool¬†\n\nWhere To Buy (Sephora - $34.00 USD - 100ml): [https://www.sephora.com/product/green-clean-makeup-meltaway-cleansing-balm-P417238?skuId=1899103&icid2=products%20grid:p417238:product](https://www.sephora.com/product/green-clean-makeup-meltaway-cleansing-balm-P417238?skuId=1899103&icid2=products%20grid:p417238:product) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/52njaem37bv51.jpg?width=5472&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ac44c763ee0c21f51609c9cc21a4692b8c86222",

I‚Äôm traveling more often and I wanted a balm that won‚Äôt leak in my bag. This product is horrible! I‚Äôve followed the directions to the T. Apply on dry face, rub in, emulsify with water. What i HATE about this product is that you have to use a damp cloth to remove all the product off your face. It creates almost a waterproof seal over your face that can‚Äôt be dissolved with water alone.  This product is expensive, and if you think the products good, then your standard are low. There‚Äôs great japanese products that are inexpensive and do a fantastic job. I don‚Äôt understand why there are so many good reviews??\n\nAm I using it wrong?

    "body": "I recently purchased a bunch of products from Farmacy at discount (shoutout Gilt coupons!) and have had FEELINGS about them, so I thought I'd share! As an aside: I had a shipping issue, and when I e-mailed the Farmacy customer service, I had a response and solution in 10 minutes. This obviously doesn't make their products *better* but I wanted to shout out to their stellar customer service gals.\n\n* Dew It All eye cream: Nothing much to say here; this was a cart-filler to max out my coupon value. I wear contacts and my eyes get irritated easily, so I'd been in business for an eye cream with minimal irritants. I find mineral oil (and derivatives like aquaphor and vaseline) irritate my eyes at night if I apply them too close, but products with Glycerin are less irritating. What can I say - eye creams don't cause miracles overnight, but this one is hydrating and the hyaluronic acid does visibly juice up fine lines when it's applied. I was worried the fatty alcohols would irritate my skin, but didn't experience any.\n\nINGREDIENTS: Water, Glycerin, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Jojoba Esters, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Patented Echinacea Purpurea ‚ÄòGreenenvytm‚Äô Root Extract, Candelilla/ Jojoba/Rice Bran Polyglyceryl-3 Esters, Glyceryl Stearate, Undecane, Adansonia Digitata Seed (Baobab) Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Gluconolactone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Tridecane, Arachidyl Alcohol, Ribose, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Behenyl Alcohol, Strelitzia Nicolai Seed Aril Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Glucoside, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin, Gellan Gum, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Cellulose Gum, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Amino-Esters-1, Calcium Gluconate, Amino Ester-1, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Muricatum Fruit Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Algae Extract, Salicylicacid, Ocimumsanctumleafextract, Tocopherol, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Lawsonia Inermis Extract, Ocimum Basilicum (Basil) Extract, Pearl Powder (Margarita Powder), Sorbic Acid, Lactic Acid, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Glycolate.\n\n\n* Honey Savior all-in-one Salve: This one is my favorite. The texture is liquid but applies like an oil or melting balm. I've been using it on my cuticles and face where I get dry patches (chin, apples of cheeks, between eyebrows). I love the texture, smell, and it's been very nourishing and hydrating used at night. \n\nINGREDIENTS: Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Hydroxystearic/Linolenic/Linoleic Polyglycerides, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Honey Extract, Canola Oil, Propolis Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Rhus Succedanea Fruit Wax, Rhus Verniciflua Peel Wax, Echinacea Purpurea Root Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Wax, Tocopherol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Beeswax, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Honey, Flavor.\n\n* Honey Potion Mask: Honestly thought I'd love this one more than I did. The packaging is gorgeous and it comes with a tiny magnetic spatula to apply product. But I have very sensitive skin and this product has a *very* intense warming sensation when massaged into the skin. I left it on for 5 minutes and had to wash it off because it was stinging. It made my face quite red, and burned my eyes while washing it off. Once the redness subsided, my skin did feel softer, but I think the results were not worth the pain. Masks should feel relaxing and indulgent. This one made me feel panicked. \n\nINGREDIENTS: Glycerin, Diglycerin, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Honey Extract, Propolis Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, Panthenol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Allantoin, Phenoxyethanol, Echinacea Purpurea Root Extract, Honey, Water, Flavor, Vanillyl Butyl Ether\n\n* Green Clean cleansing balm: I hadn't jumped on the oil/balm cleansing train because I don't wear heavy makeup, and always felt like a cleanser+toner was enough to clear my skin. But after trying this guy, I'm definitely going to be adding it as a pre-cleanse step for nights where my face feels greasy or dry. It has a lovely silky texture and a tiny amount gives a thorough cleanse without stripping the skin at all. It does have citrus oils, so I've only been using it at night in case it makes my skin more photosensitive. \n\nINGREDIENTS: Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Peg-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Peg-10 Isostearate, Polyethylene, Phenoxyethanol, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Amino Esters-1, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Amber Powder, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Water/ Aqua/ Eau, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Echinacea Purpurea Root Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Moringa Pterygosperma Seed Extract, Disodium Phosphate, Citric Acid",

Currently I use a mix between Drunk Elephant and The Ordinary skincare products, so I'm familiar and have grown used to stated percentages of ingredients, acids, BHA/AHA's, etc. \n\nMy current routine:\n\nMORNING:\n\n* rinse face with water\n\n* DE C-Firma\n\n* DE Shaba Eye Complex\n\n* The Ordinary Vitamin C complex for d√©colletage \n\n* DE B-Hydra on both face and d√©colletage \n\nEVENING:\n\n* Cleanse with La Mer the Cleansing Gel using Clarisonic\n\n* Rinse with La Mer the Micellar Water\n\n* DE Framboos on both face and d√©colletage \n\n* DE Shaba Eye Complex\n\n* DE Marula Oil\n\n* The Ordinary Rose Hip Seed Oil on d√©colletage \n\n* DE Lala Retro\n\n\nI typically use the TLC Sukari Babyfacial every 3rd day or so (my skin tolerates this interval well, so I'm not too concerned about that), and will use The Ordinary 23% AHA/BHA mask every week or so. \n\nI really love my routine so far, and don't have any complaints, however when doing at home chemical peels (10-40% glycol peels) my skin can get dry under my makeup, so hydration is something I'd be interested in. \n\nGiven all that, I was wondering if anyone uses these products or can tell me if they'd be worth purchasing. Some of the products I'm interested in are the:\n\n* [Blue Tansy AHA + BHA Resurfacing Clarity Mask](https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask), which lists: Aloe Barbadensis (Organic Aloe) Leaf Juice, Hydroxyethyl Ethylcellulose (plant derived), Glycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Salix Nigra (Willow) Bark Extract, Tanacetum Annuum (Blue Tansy) Flower Oil, Jasminum Sambac (Jasmine) Flower Water, Ananas Sativus (Organic Pineapple) Fruit Extract, Carica Papaya (Organic Papaya) Fruit Extract, Carica Papaya (Organic Papaya) Leaf Extract, Leucidal (Radish Root ferment)\n\n* The [MOON FRUIT Superfruit Night Treatment](https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/moon-fruit-super-fruit-night-treatment) which has: Organic Aloe Leaf Juice (Aloe Barbadensis), Red Raspberry Seed Oil (Rubus Idaeus), Organic Prickly Pear Oil (Opuntia Ficus-lndica), Kokum Butter (Garcinia Indica), Organic Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Organic Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Organic Rosehip Seed Oil (Rosa Canina), Hyaluronic Acid, Organic Ylang Ylang Flower Oil (Cananga Odorata), Organic Bilberry Fruit Extract (Vaccinium Myrtillus), Organic Sugar Cane Extract (Saccharum Officinarum), Organic Sugar Maple Extract (Acer Saccharinum), Organic Orange Peel Extract (Citrus Sinensis), Organic Lemon Peel Extract (Citrus Limon), Organic Cranberry Fruit Extract (Vaccinium Macrocarpon), Organic Papaya Fruit Extract (Carica Papaya), Organic Goji Berry Extract (Lycium Barbarum), Xanthan Gum, Indigo Powder (Baphicacanthus Cusia [Nees] Bremek), Ultramarine Blue, Manganese Violet\n\n* The [Phoenix Facial Oil](https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/phoenix-facial-oil) which lists: Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Rosa Canina (Rosehip) Seed Oil, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Salvia Hispanica (Chia) Seed Oil, CoQ10, Hippophae Rhamnoides L (Sea Buckthorn) Oil, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Rosa Damanscena (Moroccan Rose) Absolute, Citrus Aurantium (Neroli) Essential Oil.\n\n* The [Lapis Facial Oil](https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1) which lists: Amaranthus Squalane Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Capric Triglycerides (Fractionated Coconut Oil), Aleurites Moluccana (Kukui) Nut Oil, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Tanacetum annuum (Blue Tansy) Leaf Oil, Jasminum Sambac (Jasmine) Absolute, Rosa Damascena (Moroccan Rose) Absolute\n\n* The [Orchid Facial Oil](https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/orchid-facial-oil) which has: Capric Triglycerides (Fractionated Coconut Oil), Cymbidium Grandiflorum (Orchid) Flower Extract, Camellia Oleifera (Camellia) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Amaranthus Squalane Oil, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Jasminum Sambac (Jasmine) Absolute.\n\nAre any of these products worth it, compared to what I could get from The Ordinary or Drunk Elephant?

        "body": "I have the Blue Tansy mask on my face right now! I've gone through 3 or 4 jars, I absolutely love it. It is the one thing that when used consistently (every day for 4 days, once or twice a week after) makes the biggest difference for my skin. I don't tend to shell out for refills often, but when I dropped and broke a brand new jar of this mask, I ordered a replacement as soon as I stopped crying. I cannot say enough good things about it. I am interested to know how the DE Babyfacial compares, but I'm EXTREMELY happy with Blue Tansy. After one use, it reduces the life of pimples I already have and when I wake up the next morning, all the red marks from old ones seem significantly lighter. I feel radiant when I make time to use this product consistently. \n\nI've also gone through two minis and half a full size of Lapis oil. I don't really use it anymore and actually think my full size bottle may have gone off by now (the color seems different lately), but it also made a difference in my routine when I used it consistently. It did seem to help control oil production when used in the AM, smells and feels wonderful going on, and I felt like it helped with redness a lot. I've fallen off the oil wagon, so I haven't used it in a while and don't know if I will pick it back up as I don't have the willpower to try and figure out how/where to fit it back into my routine. I think it's definitely worth buying the mini size though.\n\nI tried a sample of Moonfruit and thought it was meh. The sample dried out and molded before I could get through it, but to be fair they have since reformulated (I got a deluxe sample when it first  released) and I put it down for a long time. I recently threw it out and was never wowed enough to consider purchasing the full size.\n\nYou didn't ask, but the Rose Hibiscus spray is one of my other favorites. It's $32 for a full size. I got the S/S set last year to try the brand, and I decided to use the spray because it was included but I wouldn't repurchase because it's a freaking rose water spray and those can be had for so much cheaper. BUT I've repurchased it 3 times and have a backup bottle ready to go. I don't know WHAT it does, but it definitely does something. There is no comparison in my opinion, between Herbivore's spray and something from the drugstore or MB.  \n\nThat S/S kit included Blue Tansy, Rose Hibiscus, Pink Clay mask, mini Lapis oil, and one of their lip balms. It was about $100, but they sent me a coupon and I think I got it for $85. That was my first purchase and the only things I wasn't thrilled with were the Pink Clay mask and the lip balm. I have repurchased everything else included at least once. If they have that kind of deal again, I would DEF look into it. I think they give you 20% off for signing up to their newsletter, and a code for reviewing products that has been the same since I've been a customer, so I use that whenever I order from the site. \n\nI've also used their Pink Clay and Bamboo Charcoal soap bars. I'm currently still using the charcoal one and haven't touched the pink one for a while, but I think the pink one actually worked better for me. \n\nBASICALLY Herbivore is the only brand I've ever repurchased from so many times, and I plan to continue. I think they're very worth it. I'm no help with fitting Herbivore into your routine, but I definitely think you should check them out!",

However, the formulation itself is not ‚Äúideal‚Äù for me‚Ä¶even as a body product.\n\nSunscreen sprays that I have used in the past have been oily, sticky, greasy, and generally uncomfortable to wear and I was hoping that Supergoop! would be able to ‚Äúelevate‚Äù this type of SPF to a more refined level. Well‚Ä¶they did not.\n\nAside from some Green Tea Leaf Extract, Grape Seed Oil, other extracts, preservatives, and texturizes‚Ä¶this spray is pretty much Denatured Alcohol and essential oils.\n\nAnd when I say essential oils‚Ä¶I mean ALL the essential oils LOL! Lime, Grapefruit Peel, Lemon Peel, Mandarin Orange, Tangerine Leaf, Sweet Orange, Peppermint, and Spearmint Oil all make it into this one formula. \n\nWith all of those fragrant oils the scent really ended up reminding me of insect repellant spray‚Ä¶maybe a citrus-y insect repellent spray.\n\nOnce applied, this product feels oily and greasy. It does ‚Äúdry down‚Äù after about 15-20 minutes‚Ä¶but that initial time after application is a bit uncomfortable and I worried I would be staining my sleeves with oil.\n\nNow don‚Äôt get me wrong‚Ä¶I love a nice dry oil on my arms/chest and am a total sucker for ‚Äúglow inducing‚Äù products. But, this mist never really ‚Äúset‚Äù the way I wanted it too and just felt kind of gross. \n\nIf you are in a bind or need to get sunscreen on as quickly as possible, I guess this product might be an okay option as the mist quickly sprays in a broad/even pattern.\n\nBut I have to believe there are better/more comfortable spray SPF products out there that skip out on the alcohol and massive dose of fragrant oils‚Ä¶RIGHT?\n\nShoot any suggestions my way! \n\nFull Ingredients List: \n\nActive Ingredients: Avobenzone 2.8%, Homosalate 9.8%, Octisalate 4.9%, Octocrylene 9.5%\n\nInactive Ingredients: Alcohol Denat., Butyloctyl Salicylate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Oil, Citrus Nobilis (Mandarin Orange) Peel Oil, Citrus Reticulata (Tangerine) Leaf Oil, Citrus Sinensis Peel Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Diisopropyl Adipate, Ethyl Ferulate, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Mentha Viridis (Spearmint) Leaf Oil, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Tridecyl Neopentanoate, VA/Butyl Maleate/Isobornyl Acrylate Copolymer, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil\n\nWhere To Buy (Supergoop!

    "body": "I received this recently as a tester so I decided to give it a try, without checking on the ingredients list first (my fault, I know!) and serves me right because this product did my skin dirtyyy. Here‚Äôs my thorough review.\n\nMy Skin Type: Combination. My skin is not usually sensitive.\n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Niacinamide, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carrageenan, Gellan Gum, Betaine, Algin, Mannan, Ceramide NP, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Chlorphenesin, Arginine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Centella Asiatica Extract, Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit Extract, Salicornia Herbacea Extract, Phragmites Communis Extract, Adenosine, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil\n\n*Too many essential oils! Note that it also contains Algin which is highly comedogenic.*\n\nClaims (copied from website):\n- A multifunctional product that can be used as a mask, sleeping pack or daily moisturizer. Fortified with the antioxidant power of vitamin E to brighten, improve wrinkles, and prevent signs of aging.\n- Use it during the day to protect the skin from UV damages and use it at night for wrinkle improvement and skin regeneration.\n- With a pudding-like texture, the cream transform into a rich essence that helps the product tightly adhere onto the skin, which maintains and lock-in the moisture for at least 8 hours. This memory foam consistency will give an overnight miracle of brighter, firmer, and more hydrated skin.\n- Can be used as sleeping pack or daily moisturizer.\n\nMy Review: I love the pudding-like texture and it absorbs really fast on my skin. The texture reminds me of Neutrogena Oil Free Moisture for Combination Skin, only more pudding-y if you get what I mean. It also makes my skin feels nice and silky smooth upon application, but after a while my skin starts to feel tight and itchy. And after only a few hours, I broke out in various areas :(\n\nMy Thoughts: Although I‚Äôm not 100% certain, I strongly feel that the essential oils and the Algin are what causing the breakouts. I feel like this could‚Äôve been a great product if they do not include those ingredients because there are many good ingredients in it as well.\n\nWould absolutely not recommend this product to anyone (YMMV, but looking at the ingredients, please just invest your money in something ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù).\n\nThank you for reading! :)",

The texture was super nice and it felt so hydrating at first but for a sleeping mask it felt like it just vanished too fast on my skin and left kind of a weird film. It didn't really do much of anything for my skin and after a while I did start to suspect it was breaking me out, not terribly but a little. I use the Etude House Soonjung sleeping mask now which I love, it feels so soothing and it's the thickest most occlusive thing I've ever been able to put on my face without clogging the hell out of my skin.",

    "body": "I am wondering if anyone has any suggestions on how to make your own warming and/or tingling lube at home using essential¬†oils? \n\nI used to really enjoy KY tingling lube, but it has gotten crazy expensive and¬†is really difficult to¬†find, so I'm looking to make my own version. This also has the added benefit of being able to leave out a lot of the chemicals found in traditional store-bought lube. My thought was to use something like X-Lube or coconut oil as the base.\n\n\n\nBefore the comments start to get too off topic, let's get a few things out of the way:\n\n* I understand not to apply essential oils without properly diluting them first.\n* I understand that if you use an oil based product (i.e. coconut oil or similar) to dilute the essential oil that the lube will not be compatible with latex condoms.\n* I understand that some essential oils have a max dermal limit. I plan to stay way below the IFRA (International Fragrance Association) max dermal limits¬†for leave-on products (those are significantly lower than wash off, usually half the rate).\n\nI'm interested in hearing from people that have actually tried this and getting feedback and suggestions on things that worked well. Along with any math and/or ratios for specific recipes and/or oil combinations that provide pleasant sensations.\n\n\n\nI also plan to start with the absolute minimum and work up from there.¬†\n\nEx) Let's say that the maximum number of drops is 20, but the recommended number is 10. I would honestly start with 1 drop and test a small amount. If that doesn't have much of a sensation, I would add another drop, remix, and test again until I found a suitable ratio.\n\n\n\nTo be clear, there are already several commercially available lubes that use essential oils in their products. Here are a few that I was able to find in a quick search, but I'm sure there are others:\n\n**Durex Massage & Play 2 in 1 Lubricant, 6.76 oz, Sensual with Ylang Ylang¬†Ingredients:**¬†Water, Propylene Glycol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Benzoic Acid, Sodium Saccharin, Sodium Hydroxide, Sorbitol, Polysorbate 20, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol,¬†**Cananga Odorata (Ylang Ylang) Flower Oil**, Ethylhexylglycerin, Flavors.\n\n**KY Natural Feeling Lube & Massage Gel with Botanical Essence Ingredients:**¬†Water, Propylene Glycol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Flavor, Benzoic Acid, Sodium Saccharin, Sodium Hydroxide, Sorbitol, Polysorbate 20, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol,¬†**Cananga Odorata Flower Oil**, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**Cake Cooling Lube Ingredients:** water (Aqua), propanediol, polysorbate 20, gluconolactone, hydroxyethylcellulose, sodium benzoate,¬†**mentha piperita (peppermint) leaf extract**, citric acid.\n\n**Cake¬†Stim For Him Ingredients:** Water (Aqua), Propylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Polysorbate 80, Oleth-10, Sodium Hyaluronate,¬†**Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) oil, Kwao Krua Dang (Butea Superba) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract**, Caffeine, Niacin, Menthol, Carbomer, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aminomethyl Propanol",

A lot of common preservatives for topical formulas can be irritating or otherwise not ideal for mucous membranes, and you can't just reduce the concentration the way a commercial operation might because it's expensive to stress-test the formula and make sure it's not growing microbes despite a weaker preservation system.  Commercial factories are also able to maintain close to sterile environments that are hard to replicate at home, which means the preservatives in a home formula have to work harder.  If you must use a water-based formula, use it up that day and discard any excess, even if you stored it in the fridge.\n\nIf you're not using it with condoms, anhydrous oil-based lube would be easier to store.  Be careful sourcing your essential oils and other additives, I would use cosmetic-grade ingredients from a reputable source (e.g. not Amazon).  You can also buy pure cosmetic-grade menthol crystals as an alternative to essential oils.",

        "body": "Here are the essential ingredients I would use:\n\nDimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane.\n\nAll the oils are unnecessary irritants, and even if you don't react to them they are wholly unnecessary and buying bottles of each will cost WAY more than $25 in the end. They are primarily used for scent and possibly for the \"cooling\" sensation which is popular in men's products but is NOT positive in any way, and can in fact be drying and irritating.\n\nI would do the following recipe:\n\n* [Dimethicone](http://www.lotioncrafter.com/dm6-dimethicone.html) (3%)\n\n* [Cyclopentsiloxane](http://www.lotioncrafter.com/lc995-cyclomethicone.html) (85%)\n\n* [Cromollient SCE](http://www.lotioncrafter.com/cromollient-sce.html) (10%) which is an emulsifier, that you need in order for it to be clean-rinsing\n\n* Tea tree oil (2% or so, up to 5%) (only if desired, TTO is good for acne and it smells nice, and may feel refreshing, but is unnecessary. At percentages up to 5% it is safe for skin use and will not dry excessively, but do not use at a higher concentration and it also will sensitize you to sun, so use with SPF at all times)\n\nYou don't need a preservative as long as you are using a bottle that WILL NOT get water in it. If using a pump bottle, mix in small batches and you can leave preservative out. If you're using an open neck bottle and suspect that you will drip or get ANY amount of water in it from transferring with your hands etc, then use a broad-spectrum preservative such as Optiphen at a level of 0.5%-1%",

Check out the numerous articles by Tonya McKay on Naturally Curly (yes a head hair website) for properties of different families of silicones, or Point of Interest! on Swiftcraftymonkey's blog.\n\nYou don't have any natural plant oils in that product, why do you want to add grapeseed oil? That may well give a quite different feel to that which you like. Personally I would use the dimethicone and a -siloxane as already suggested.\n\nINCI ingredients lists are used in Europe, this means the ingredient that is at the highest percentage is first on the list which tells you there is more dimethicone than cyclopentasiloxane.\n\nMost of the rest is potentially irritating or allergenic fragrant essential oils, ie. unnecessary or even detrimental to skin (tho you may want a little tea tree oil for antibacterial properties, should be stored in a dark glass bottle or other light/ air protective container).",

        "body": "I'm a DIY noob, but I'll try to help.\n\nThe ingredients list looks like a bunch of silicones mixed with a bunch of essential oils, with the bulk of it being the silicones. Tea Tree Oil, as with many essential oils, is typically used at up to 1% since anything higher can cause serious burns/irritation, so everything after that is at most 1% of the mixture. I'm guessing all those essential oils are mostly for fragrance. The last string of ingredients \"Benzyl Salicylate, Eugenol, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate, Farnesol, Linalool, Limonene,\" are typically what I've seen in very fragrant products, and from what I understand are chemicals often found in fragrances.\n\nTaking all that info together, I would guess that the shaving oil is probably something like 95%+ of silicones. For a DIY option I'm pretty sure dimethicone is all you need. A simple ingredient list of dimethicone+grape seed oil will likely be fine for your purposes, and you could add essential oils for fragrance as you like. The ratio of dimethicone:grape seed oil will be up to you.",

Easy enough. I'm using Cerave hydrating facial cleanser,Alastin regenerating skin nectar + Vanicream when needed, and the tinted Elta MD UV Elements Broad-Spectrum SPF 44. I typically use Farmacy Green Clean Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm to take off my SPF before applying moisturizer. I used it evening of procedure and day after. I looked up the product because I'm almost out and happened to look at the ingredients and it has papaya enzymes in it which is an exfoliating ingredient! It's pretty high up on the list of ingredients, too. Will my results be impacted by this? I'm obviously not using it anymore and will be using Dermalogica precleanse to remove my SPF (no exfoliators, just oils and vitamin e) but I'm really scared. My face feels and looks fine but my cheeks don't have nearly as much post surgery pigmentation then I thought/was hoping it would have. My skin hasn't begun to flake yet and I know that the post-procedure pigmentation is a good thing before shedding starts. Am I overreacting?

    "body": "First time post jitters here. Short backstory: I have been making an effort to invest in selfcare ever since we lost my dad at the start of the year. Skin care, primarily. Prior to January I was not using any products on my face daily, or hardly at all. No cleansers, no sunscreen, no makeup, but my bare skin was not smooth or soft, but dry especially around the mouth and the forehead, tight feeling, and I have occasional blotchy redness to my cheeks that my mum has always said is \"her rosacea\". I've been slowly trying to find products that work for my surprisingly fussy skin (I have had reactions to things like Thayers Witch Hazel, and most moisturizers just sit on my skin instead of absorbing), and despite my attempts so far have not landed on anything that hasn't lead to eventual breakouts. \n\nThe routine I have been using is as follows:\n„ÄãAromatica Orange Cleansing Sherbert

dampen the cleanser in circular motions which causes it to foam a little, then rinse in warm water. Then the Atoclassic gel/foam cleanser which foams lightly upon application, rinse in warm water, rinse with cool water. Pat dry with a towel, then wet a cotton pad with toner which I gently wipe over my face mostly just to remove the billions of tiny towel bits that migrate from the towel into my face when I pat dry. Then emulsion, and serum, and finally just enough moisturizer to be evenly applied.\n\nIt seemed to be working okay (some days I'd even be really happy with my skin), but lo and behold after 3 weeks I started breaking out. I wasn't careful enough after reading up on here about only adding one product at a time, so today I am have reeled back my routine to just double cleansing before bed. I know I should have a moisturizer in addition to that but I think that the Tatcha Indigo Cream may have been what tipped the cart before, so I'm hesitant to add it.\n\nMy question from all of this is- how long should I wait before slowly introducing another product? I don't want to add back too fast to discover what doesn't work. Could this have just been purging? I feel like the answer is no, but skin is weird and there's a lot that I don't know still.",

I've been given the trial pack of Hada Labo Hydrating Snow Dew not long ago and have went through half the jar seeing good results in oil control on my face, so I was considering in getting the big version, However when I took an extra glance at the ingredient list\n\n>Water, Propanediol, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Methylpropanediol, Sodium Acrylates Crosspolymer-2, Phenoxyethanol, Pentylene Glycol, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Xanthan Gum, Theobroma Grandiflorum Seed Butter, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Niacinamide, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Trehalose, Butylene Glycol, UREA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Styrene/VP Copolymer, Hydrogenated Phosphatidylcholine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Inonotus Obliquus (Mushroom) Extract, Serine, Inulin, Citrus Sinensis Extract, Carnosine, Opuntia Streptacantha Stem Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tapioca Starch, Algin, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium Phosphate, Pullulan, 1,2-Hexanediol, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Yogurt Powder, Alpha-Glucan Oligosaccharide, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil, Yeast Polysaccharides, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Lactic Acid, Polianthes Tuberosa Extract, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil, Allantoin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Potassium Phosphate, Triethanolamine, Sorbic Acid, Ceteareth-20, Collagen, Citric Acid, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ceramide NP, Sarcosine, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Sorbate, Palmitoyl Hexapeptide-12\n\nI found out that Phenoxyethanol, a preservative, is at the 7th position in the list, I'm normally fine with this ingredient and own a few products that includes this, but I usually saw it at the bottom of the list. This is the first time I've seen it this high up on the list, indicating that it's the 7th largest amount of ingredients by weight in this product. A quick Google trip told me the normal concentration used is up to 1% or lower and now this really makes me curious of\n\n1. Do that mean the concentration of Phenoxyethanol used in this product is more than 1%?\n2. If yes, why they need this much if 1% is already effective?\n3. If it is within the regulated 1%, how effective will the other ingredients behind it be when they are far below 1%\n\nI'm pretty new to skincare and am pretty confused because it's the first time I see a product like this, would appreciate more insight from you guys who have more experience in more products, thanks!",

I really love [this cleanser](http://www.paulaschoice.com/skin-balancing-oil-reducing-cleanser/115.html?cgid=category-cleansers#start=5), it isn't too drying, has zero fragrance and works very well.

If it's good - then just incorporate it back into your routine.",

I saw more of a difference (more dullness) after I cut it out, so I knew it was doing something. The main ingredient is daisy extract.\n* Daylogic radiance overnight gel mask - only available at Rite Aid. $7. It calls itself a \"mask\", but I use it as a serum. The instructions say to use up the 1 oz container in 3 uses, which is ridiculous and you definitely don't need that much. This is probably the only brightening product where I could see my skin getting brighter after only a week of use. Ingredients include niacinamide, oligopeptide-68, and tranexamic acid.\n* Skinlex arbutin serum and niacinamide extended serum - not available at the drugstore, but are drugstore priced. They brighten a bit better than Burt's Bees but not as effectively as Daylogic. Both are watery, the arbutin serum being more so, and both provide a very light layer of hydration.",

    "body": "I tried MISSHA's snail line on a whim in 2019 and was really so impressed with their Super Aqua Snail Essential Moisturizer that I decided to branch out into their anti aging products after they discontinued their snail moisturizer\n\n**Here's the PSA though :more products than not by Missha contain fragrance, fragrant oils, and are not only scented, but extremely scented. I am ok with fragrance or scented products, but I don't see the point of intense scents that mimic actual perfume being added to skincare, as well as in the long term skin sensitizing.**\n\nThe snail line that I tried earlier was scented and it was definitely in the perfume category, but perhaps it was a fluke because I liked it. After trying their Royal Regenerating line right now, I have to make a PSA though. This line smells like soap and is an unholy version of Dove Bars. If you have ever been in a chocolate factory, you know what I mean by something familiar that gets \"perverted\" as the concentration of it increases. I can't imagine the majority of this subreddit liking or endorsing their products just based off the scent alone. I have tried the whole snail line, which is heavily scented and perfumey, and the Red Algae line, which is actually light and sweet smelling, however it still comes off as fragranced. The sun milk essence (green cap) and pink version agree also very heavily fragranced. \n\nIf scents don't bother you, you should still avoid them though as in addition to fragrance, they seem to ruin a lot of their products with sensitizing plant oils, even in their ampoules and their line for sensitive skin! Some examples: Cananga Odorata Flower Oil, Bergamot Fruit Oil, Lavendar Oil, Orange Peel Oil, Pine Oil!?, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (ylang ylang), or Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil (rose). I really don't understand this either. These oils contain voltaile compounds that can increase your general skin sensitivity over time as well as photosensitive you.",
