TOP 5 POSITIVE BENEFITS:
----------------------------------------
1. ts and noticed it had hyaluronic acid. Iâ€™ve taken biotin and hair skin and nails vitamins for years and have never seen these results. So even if it is placebo, Iâ€™m still looking good. Can confirm, I took three pills of this stuff and got a completely different breakout to the acne I usually get. Beauty pills my ass. Confirmed by my face! Wanted nicer skin and played myself by taking biotin. In some ways, but I'm pleased to have something that helps my nails. I have kept taking it once I started because it has made a positive difference, but it hasn't made my nails any worse than befor
2. always grown really fast though so I can't say if biotin plays a roll.  I can't attest to the overall health either because I bleach it to platinum blonde.  Your hair is beautiful and looks very healthy! Yup, I went from 1000mg to 5000mg to 10,000mg over the last five years and my hair grew stupidly fast. It was great because long hair, not so great because long hair is high maintenance. I was actually taking it because Iâ€™m apparently prone to excessive hair loss under stress (which is more frequent as I get older). I stopped recently sorta - I switched to the Nature Bounty pills which have 5,000mg. I know theyâ€™re not more than a multivitamin but my old roomie swore by them and said they helped regrow her bald spots so Iâ€™m crossing my fingers for a miracle at my temples and hair line. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Noooo lol, buy it from amazon!! Itâ€™s like $85 for all three bottles (last time I checked). You can buy all three or individually. Thatâ€™s what I did! I needed it for a YouTube review when I put liscio on my dyed hair, and it came via Prime. Saved my hair (this was before I chopped my hair off, of course back when my hair was down my back). Omg thanks so much! I'm definitely buying it! Following this as I shaved my head this summer and I desperately want my hair to grow now. Good luck in your growth!! If it helps, I used protective styling and invested in some cheap (but great) wigs from amazon to help over the past year. I was using nature's bounty gummies and I'm pretty sure it helped but it broke me out. Iâ€™ve always used Natureâ€™s Bounty. Itâ€™s funny....I always thought Biotin broke me out when I tried HSN and Hairfinity, but I think it was actually other ingredients. How much water are you drinking a day? I wishhhh my hair would grow fast. It grows 1/4 to an 1/2 a month without any help. Thank you!!! Have you tried olaplex since you dye your hair? That stuff is the truthhhhh for dyed hair! I want to use olaplex but I dye it myself and ca
3. ou probably need more collagen or/and iodine than biotin for (Not DHT related) hair growth I feel like Biotin is definitely beneficial for hair and nails but definitely wonâ€™t stop hair loss. I found when I started taking Biotin without a 5ar blocker that my nails and hair grew really long fast at the doner area and in areas of the scalp not affected by mpb yet but the areas that were miniaturising kept doing so just as fast If your thyroÃ¯d hormones (T3 & T4) aren't produced enough, it can result in hair loss. Iodine keeps these hormones at a normal range production Why iodine? That's what happened to me to. The quality of my nails improved drastically and so did the hair that isn't effected by MPB. It grew faster but it wasn't thicker or as healthy as the hair on the back of my head. Would you say that B5 is more useful for hair and scalp then biotin? Yeah it grew long but just looked stringy When taking biotin my nails grew faster too, but I saw no changes to my hair Any suggestions for a dosage protocol?
4. hampoo, and it really made a huge difference â€“ my hair fall reduced, and my hair became thick and healthy. Unfortunately, now it's not affordable in this economy. Could you share the recipe? How much mcg were u taking? It grew me some baby hairs in the front but I didn't notice anything else. Red light therapy helps. You have to give it some time though. Iâ€™ve had some success using hair, skin and nail gummies too. I took Biotin after chemo and my hair did seem to grow back a l
5. ch would be my suggestion as well.

Ps- regarding biotin. You can find them at the dollar Express and you'll get a month supply in one bottle so just grab like five bottles and you're good for 5 months don't stop taking it though because what you see as not working, could be the only reason you have the hair that you have left. I would add vitamin d and vitamin e "dry e" or the jelly ball looking. I think Rogaine is supposed to help with thinning at your crown. Best of luck Not much you can to at 16.  Your best option is to get a much shorter haircut... the long curly/wavy hair makes the thinning that much more noticeable.   If your not ready to just buzz it at least go with a fade on the back and sides and short on top.  Short hair will look fuller and thicker!  Go to a real barber and not a "stylist" and he will help you choose a short haircut that will be good for you.   But since it's summer, you might just consider buzzing it and see how it grows out Iâ€™ve heard that increasing the blood flow to the area by massaging or tapping or even a handstand can help, however, it may just be genetics and something like hair follicle implants or something similar are also an option. It looks worse because your hair is long a shorter haircut would look much better This is outside the expertise of this subreddit.  Go see a dermatologist or your PCP. Sorry to see this. Use coconut oil a few times a week - it helps! See a doctor Iâ€™m 21 with the same issue and making my appointment soon also try hair fiber as a temporary solution (something I might try) My advice would be to embrace it. Personally, my hairline wasn't the best as I progressed through high school. It didn't necessarily thin, but stress made my hairline mature faster. I decided to shave it, and I've been shaving my head since junior year of high school (17yrs old). It was the most freeing experience. It takes a little to get used to it. Now, I would never dream of growing my hair back. 
It's scary, and I definitely understand ho

TOP 5 NEGATIVE CONS:
----------------------------------------
1. tle nails with allot of breakage in both. My hair stopped growing past a certain point because of the breakage, and my nails were very brittle. Not to sound like an infomercial but the my nails are stronger and my hair has grown about 3 in longer. Both my nails and hair just seen healthier I've always had baby hairs (nearly 28 & my girlfriends love to bust me about them) and they gave grown out much longer than ever before. My nails are much stronger too. As for quickness of hair growth I haven't noticed anything but I've only been taking biotin inconsistently for 3-4 months. My hair is certainly thicker because TSA now pats down my head when I exit their scann
2. My doctor said biotin will not help and can make acne worse for some. Dude my dermatologist told me today to take rogaine 5% for womenâ€¦. Donâ€™t know if itâ€™s even worth it at this point . I already pay 45$ a month for my dermatologist appointment. 30$ a month for the accutane medicine and now 45$ for this rogaine . And that doesnâ€™t even include all the different shampoos and conditioners Iâ€™m going to have to buy. They say to avoid sulfates alcohols and other parts ingredients. Iâ€™ve been using OlaPlex which is top-of-the-line shampoo Iâ€™ve heard and nothing seems to be working. Iâ€™m really battling with myself on if itâ€™s even worth continuing. Iâ€™ve already had several other side effects. Fuck , I have been taking biotin and I got rogaine because I cannot keep losing ha
3. in really broke me out and dried out my face so I stopped taking it. I've started taking collagen powder a month ago and it's making my nails grow like crazy but I'm still waiting to see a difference in my hair :) Update? I use both! I'm much more consistent with taking biotin because I got them in gummy form (I am a child) and I str
4. e effect and it took a while to sort out that the biotin was the culprit. Be careful with the biotin. If you ever need blood tests, tell your doctor your taking it. Apparently biotin can mess with the results of some tests. Thank God lol Will definitely keep that in mind, thank you for pointing that out ! Thank you for pointing that out. Is there any other thing to consider? Side effects? Thanks! Not as far as I know :) Not as far as I

DOSAGE EFFECTIVENESS MENTIONS:
----------------------------------------
1. my research pls? 5000 IU and 20mg Zinc Itâ€™s because i was deficient beforehand. If you arenâ€™t deficient supplements wonâ€™t work Is It not too much vitamin D? How was your D lev
2. r while taking it. 

I took 5,000mg of biotin a day and saw results within a month. My hair grows
3. Well, we know for a fact that 320 mg will not inhibit anything. And definitely not to a degree that is able to stop hair loss. If you're really interested in knowing ***why***, read the article: [https://menscript.com/uk/articles/saw-palmetto-for-hair-loss-popular-but-ineffective](https://menscript.com/uk/articles/saw-palmetto-for-hair-loss-popular-but-ineffective). Is on my list to research.

5. ls, I wouldn't take more than 1000 mcg, 2-3 times a week, and only for a few weeks. I've heard stories of people saying that taking too much of it has the exact opposite
